I gotta say, I wasn't expecting to see Kandy in the final top two. I thought it was gonna be Gottmik vs Symone. Nevertheless, congrats to my ebony enchantress. We were all rooting for you mama I got literal goosebumps from this video. Symone was a winner in my eyes since I first saw her entering the Werk room, I'm so happy for her. First to enter the workroom ends up being the runner-up of the season, winning 1 challenge (the roast) and placing in the bottom the most out of the Top 4, while winning every lip sync except the final lip sync for the crown I love how close the top 4 seemed. They almost always do, but this season they all just seemed to have an untouchable bond I don't know if it's true or not, but some guy on reddit says that Ros√© fainted on stage vs Kandy and the lip sync needed a second take. That will explain why her movements were "slow" in comparison to her normal moves back on the first episode I stan a fighter
