1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I didn‚Äôt know i wanted to see Pierce as a superhero, but I really liked him as Dr Fate. He and Aldis as Hawkman stole the show completely. I‚Äôd genuinely love to see a show spun off of seeing those two‚Äôs history and adventures together leading up to this movie."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"This movie just made me miss when the Rock played villains. If allowed to be evil for a substantial part of the movie, it would've been much better. He was outstanding as villains in Doom, Get Smart, and even in Pain and Gain if you count that... AND in his wrestling career."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I think a lot of people are also exhausted with the antihero trope at this point. It was weird to me how hard this movie‚Äôs marketing leaned into the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like other gÃ∂iÃ∂rÃ∂lÃ∂sÃ∂ superheroes‚Äù when we‚Äôve seen the troubled antihero thing pretty much done to death in the past ten years.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"From all the ""Failed"" movies on this channel this year, black adam definetly was the best one. I actually enjoyed it but it could have been way more"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Filmento, not sure if you‚Äôll see this but thank you so much for making these videos. As an aspiring movie writer, your videos have helped so much with a script I‚Äôve written for a Film & Media class i‚Äôm in: I‚Äôve learned what to do with Film Perfection and just as much with Anatomy of a Failure. Your comedy is also gold and that‚Äôs what lead me to your channel in the first place. If it wasn‚Äôt for these videos, I might not have developed such a passion for writing for film. Thank you."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Filmento puts his money where his mouth is. While talking about bad writing, he explains what good writing is and uses those tools for good writing to seamlessly transition to an ad for manscaped. Film perfection"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,This movie was the Rock's passion project from nearly 20 years ago. I'm glad the dude finally managed to make his dream a reality but the reality is that his project came about 20 years too late.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"It was definitely the most radical mid 90s skateboarder movie ever made. Also hilarious that the bad guy is the ""only"" descendants of a guy from 5,000 years ago. That's long ago enough that 99% of people would be descendants of that evil king."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Black Adam is the perfect example of when you go all in on visuals and half ass the actual story.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"As soon as I saw the movie, I knew Filmento was gonna criticise how Black Adam was a passive character that tagged along and pushed the plot. I've clearly learned a lot on your videos."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"It's astonishing how organically you fit the ad into the point you're making into these videos lmao
Great stuff"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"There's a lot of really good bits and pieces in Black Adam, but you're right that the villain was extremely weak.  The final fight scene where the possessed Ishmael is trying to sit on the ancient throne of Khandaq is kinda goofy because they never set up why he had to sit on the throne, or what would happen if he did.  It's just ""Hey, don't let him reach the chair because reasons!"""
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I agree that I prefer movies led by characters that have agency but I thought the main objective of his character was to find his purpose so it didn't really bother me that he was on a journey from event to event trying to figure out his way.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I really liked Black Adam. The movie was just a dope, fun, dumb out, action filled escapist type of film. I liked the Rock, Dr Fate, Hawkman they call worked. I wish it was more successful. But alas it didn't get the win. Hopefully they make another one with Superman and its gets the win."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I wonder if it is possible to write a passive main character but still have the story be about them, unlike the Great Gatsby where the ""main character"" is passive but only a spectator to someone else's story."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"one of the movies of all time, when black adam said ""it's about drive it's about power"" and iron man'd all of the bad guys in the area i was in tears"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"It‚Äôs so unfortunate that this movie didn‚Äôt do better because even with a few things in it that I hated, I really had a lot of fun watching it"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Just found your channel while looking up reviews for Black Adam. I love the fact you are able to articulate what so many feel but don't know how to put into words.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"If there's marvel fatigue.
There's also The Rock fatigue."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"DC still struggling to get their Cinematic Universe off the ground is just sad. FFS even Sonic the Hedgehog has it figured out. 
Here's what you do. You make a few solid humble solo movies. Keep doing that. Then when you're three to four movies in, have a team up movie as a payoff. Or go all in with the lore if you want like how Sonic is doing by bringing in Shadow. It's simple. It's called a slow burn. Everyone wants what Marvel Studios has, but no one other than Paramount, is willing to do what Marvel did."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"There's also a thing to consider; I thought that at the beginning the movie would make a social commentary on tur role of superheroes and how they were incapable of saving an entire country from a gang, not a foreign country, but a gang of thugs for 28 years. But that turned out for nothing."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I liked the movie and i still recommend people go watch it. My only gripe was how there's a plot point introduced about Eternium being strong enough to kill Black Adam... but it's never brought up or used again. Like it could have been crafted into a sword used by the bad guys or something and I feel it was such a missed opportunity üòï
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"This should've been the sixth entry after solos for Dr. Fate, Hawkman, Mr. Terrific (who absolutely NEEDS to be on the team), a BA origin set entirely in Antiquity and a JSA team-up. 

That kind of approach would've freed up precious screentime to cultivate the ideological divide between BA and the JSA, leaning into his world-weariness and carelessness towards present day by embracing collateral damage (random passersby, one of Adriana's friends), with no cop-out footnote villain in sight and the BA/nephew origin kept intact that might turn out to be a wound ripped open by the kid taking such an interest in him and glorifying him."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"If you never seen a superhero movie before, this would be an awesome flick!"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,As an Adam I can confirm this is the most Adam movie of all time.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Black Adam's theme (music) is pretty good. Probably could be a more iconic hero theme if the movie actually made people care about him
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I think he missed the mark a bit with the fact that the clueless nature of Black Adam is intentional. He's a man from a long passed time adjusting to modern society, and also holds depth in relation to his powers and being.

*S P O I L E R*





He's a god only from a transfer of power from his son who was granted that power before. He sees himself as a hollow failure in the shadow of his son, who was the champion and savior of his people in Kandaq. He eventually gains purpose in fulfilling that mantle as protector through the side characters he interacts with."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I knew this was going to be a bad movie just from the interviews with ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù.  He was always focused on how cool he looked and how strong his character was.  He could care less about character motivations and story.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"The movie is a solid action blockbuster, but it does struggle in other areas. 

Worth learning from, but i'm still glad I saw it"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"As a writing question: can a character have no motivation until either halfway or one third of the story in? As in, it just fumbles around aimlessly but then finds something that gives them purpose"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,We need a stand-alone Dr.Fate movie
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,All this movie has is an absolutely kick ass soundtrack
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"You could even have the characters mirror each other, what if the bad guy starts as a powerless but kind individual who slowly turns cruel and powerful. Meanwhile Black Adam starts off cruel and powerful and slowly learns restraint and kindness. Yes it would still be generic but both characters would have changed through the course of the movie."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I actually really enjoyed Black Adam, though it felt more to me like a product than a movie. Still, a pretty passable product"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"in the trailer they say ""I was a slave until I died. My son died to save me"" but throughout the movie you dont hear about a son until near the end of the film and I was so very confused xD the trailer made me expect something totally different"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I think they really needed to keep us in the dark about what happened to his kid since they literally kept showing his death in the trailers and yet the movie kept trying to make it out to be a hidden twist.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I liked it. It‚Äôs not by any means a masterpiece super hero flick, but it still had some entertaining moments."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Movies like these give me the confidence to keep going with my graphic novels, knowing that I can probably come up with better stories than these Hollywood writers."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,The fact that the badass mercenary organization were useless against Black Adam and got shoved to the side in the middle of the movie greatly upset me.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,He does have the emotional goal of saving the boy as a reflection of him wanting to save his son.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"As always, great video analysing a film I thought looked great visually when the first trailer dropped. But as I was watching to the end of the trailer I asked myself, what's the point of going out to watch a movie where the hero (superhero or not) doesn't have a flaw or weak point to be exploited by the bad guy. That means I'll not care for him that he might get hurt or die from his injuries as a result of his weak point(s), meaning that he'll survive the bad guys and the main villain unscathed. So what's the point of the hero then if I cannot fear for him and his well-being? At least Superman had kryptonite to fear and Batman has his fallible humanity to fear. What does Black Adam fear that might instantly get him killed? Like I said, I haven't watched the movie as yet, but plan on watching it soon. And the only reason I haven't watched the movie yet is because it failed to give me agency to go out and watch it thru it's one selling point, it's trailers--the guy's too all powerful. But great video anyway from your number one fan!"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"As someone online pointed out, ""It's just 10 action scenes in a trench coat pretending to be a movie"""
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Let's be real, seeing the rock cast as the lead for a superhero movie of a character he looks nothing like was literally all one needed to see to know this movie was going to be trash."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I love your analysis, I don't miss a single one; They are very useful to make me understand the correct functioning of the stories, and I NEED TO KNOW: 
Why did SPEED RACER movie fail? 
Why did VALERIAN fail? 
Why was the original STAR WARS an explosive success?"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"""A bad movie is better than no movie at all"" ‚Äî hawkman, probably"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"dude your editing and meme-insertion skills are on point! your videos always make me laugh, and add to the reasoning and quality of your videos

I have 2 questions:
How do I get to your level of editing or meme-ing? It would be insane to have S-tier editing such as yours
Would you ever review Pacific Rim? It's my favorite movie, and I think it has many things which separate it from other films and makes it unique. You could make a video tearing it apart and call it the worst movie ever, and I'd still love it because of your style"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Man, your Willem Dafoe cut-ins make me want to watch the latest spiderman movie again. Holy smokes is Willem an amazing actor"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,This is the type of movie that would've succeed in the early 2000s. It's like a fun guilty pleasure superhero movie like the Tim Story's Fantastic Four movies for me. It's a movie that came out in the wrong time imo
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Another brilliant summary from Filmento. I never get tired of watching these videos.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,That sponsorship tie-in was legitimately funny! XD Very well done!
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Hmm, your point on the protagonists ability to drive the story made me think about the book I'm writing. The protagonist group operates mostly under orders from higher up officials, with the large scale plot essentially being how you would expect the set up circumstances to play out. So I'm not sure if the protagonists relatively small role in actually driving the plot is a big issue."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I found this movie to be the epitome of ""dumb action done well"". When viewing from an analytical standpoint, the flaws are quite glaring, but if you don't take the movie very seriously and sort of turn your brain off, it can provide some enjoyable scenery."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"This just reminds me we need a take on Zatanna and how she has her dad ""borrowed"" to become doctor fate forever. That was one of the most emotional parts of DC for me, where she says goodbye to her dad and is only allowed to speak to him once a year. Sounds like a job for Pierce."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Thanks for your work. This channel is absolutely amazing. I have already watched half of all videos. I am still learning how to write and now my stories are simply 100x better than before. Keep up the amazing work. :)
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Having somebody overanalyze why I personally disliked something makes me depressed and happy at the same time
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"It is a perfectly fine late 90s comic book movie. Given the crud served to us lately, we will gladly take cliche, by the numbers superhero formula. Besides, there is no Martha scene so that is always a win"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I like how you analysis movies. I use all points you make about a movie in my camping in RPG like the examples of stakes, urgency, choices, twist, and so one, really improved the game"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"The Rock isn't a solo star BTW, he's an ensemble star. Every movie that The Rock headlines alone has been his least successful. He's just not that good to carry an entire movie but effective in small doses as supporting."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I think a lot of directors started seeing the popularity of Batman's ""I don't kill"" policy and thought that meant ""Well, I guess that means heroes that don't kill aren't special!""

Every damned superhero film since the Dark Knight has grazed this issue at least once. It's always the same - a superhero kills people, but it's ok because Batman is a pussy.

It's been done before."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"They should have introduced him as a Captain Marvel/Superman villain first then, if he's fleshed out enough, do a Black Adam origin/redemption movie."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"They could‚Äôve made this villain a freedom fighter who just wanted the crown to set his people free. But also killing innocent people at the end, so Black Adam might‚Äôve changed his mind about being anti hero."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I went from being excited to see this film to falling asleep about two-thirds in.

It was just‚Ä¶ boring. I woke up during the end credits and figured I'd just try to watch it again through streaming ‚Äì then I found out that the end was just a big CGI fight with a bunch of skeletons. Hard pass. There was so much potential wasted with this."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Much respect to Dwayne Johnson for everything that he's accomplished in his career, as well as his physique but maaan...can Hollywood just stop casting him?

I roll my eyes every time he's announced in a movie and we know dang well that he's just going to play The Rock for the seven hundredth time. He has the acting range for wrestling and that's it..."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"It would've been interesting if the bad guy's motive was ""kick the foreigners out of the country"" so we can control our own destiny , and that was Black Adam's original goal. So when Adam decides to zap the throne in the end, it's because he realized he's the outside invader.

Of course, it would seem hypocritical of the villain to use foreign PMC, but if we learn that he sees the hired help as tools, just like he sees the Kahndahaqi people despite his lofty rhetoric, that would show he's a bad guy. Especially if Adam and his allies assumed the villain wanted the McGuffin to sell to foreigners. Or it looked like the main villain was just a local coerced into working with them, like Adrianna, but the villain gradually starts taking charge over the course of the movie, as Adam takes out the merc leadership. Turns out he was pretending to be cowed and cowardly, and taking charge was his real plan all along.

Only problem is that it would seem, well, a lot like Killmonger from BP."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,It was a fun film. I enjoyed it. Absolutely loved black adam pulling no punches.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Hey filmento I have a question for you, and anyone honestly. How can I make an origin movie about a character who is already part of a larger universe but their origin story never was established?"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Congratulations Filmento. You pushed in the smoothest sponsor segment I've ever seen. I didn't even notice it was a manscaped ad at first. Well done.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I was surprised he was able to handle the hell fire. I thought it was something to burn everything if it was true hell fire, so perhaps it was not such.
But yeah, it was quite the butnuster. I thought we get to see something awesome and this is what we got. Nothing wrong in Dwayne as the Black Adam, he nailed it and the fast movement and all was nicely done. It just lacked a lot of Black Adam itself."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"How did they move Black Adam back to her house? Even as a normal guy, you'd need a whole team of people to move him that far."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Filmento has trained me well. While I was watching the movie, I already noted Rock-Adam had no agency. And, as per Filmento tradition, it had a very simple way to fix it: follow the damn comic books, and make him strive to become the King of Kahndaq.

Also, the Justice Society was SO poorly utilized. Not only they could have leaned harder into the colonialist commentary, with the group of americans only showing up when a big threat is detected, but they also had TWO timeless characters that could have had personal relationships with Teth-Adam and known he is dangerous (instead of depending on the Waller, the Oracle of Exposition).

Hawkman is a reincarnating being, so one version of him could have been alive back then (maybe even killed by Adam destroying the palace) and the Helm of Nabu is millions of years old, meaning there definitely was a Dr. Fate when Kahndaq existed.

So much potential wasted..."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I liked the movie honestly. It was bit of a mess in writing and tonal departments and not really unique at all but what it was, was rather enjoyable and unapologetic superhero flick that focused on the cool aspect. Seeing the heroes fight and flex their powers was just fun. I was not expecting anything more out of the movie so barely passable job on writing worked just fine in grand scheme of things. That demon guy gave me some major conniptions though."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"You bring up a lot of good points in this, and the alternative way they could've done it you said sounds like it would make for a lot more compelling story.

This movie was decent, but it really lacked good writing and also some of the things towards the end were just stupid. Still mad Dr. Fate died cause he was just standing front and center when he had a bunch of illusions, he would arguably be a *much* more interesting character to explore."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"The part that keep taking me out of the movie was the kid in it . i found alot of the stuff with the kid to be cringe and annoying . if they cut the kid it would of helped for one .
i hate how everyone thinks doctor fate is a rip off of doctor strange . when doctor fate has been around alonger time then doctor strange even in the comics . it just doctor strange got a movie first. and i like both of them but doctor fate in the movie is more interesting then strange in the movies."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I enjoyed this movie.  Not my favourite, but definitely one of the least troublesome movies to watch.  None of the characters except for  Viola Davis was insufferable.  No big pushing of the ""message"", and I like the twist with the Rock's character."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I would really love to see him make a movie. He knows what he is talking about.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,isnt that the point tho that the real main characters are the ordinary people the kid who gives inspiration the town and the people and not the actual super human i felt like that message was the whole point of the movie and was really fucking awesome. i mean the kid has the biggest story the biggest character and hes the one that moves the plot along hes the one with the motivation i feel like thats the point of the movie and a nice message to us the normal people
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,The idea of villain being just a regular guy who was pushed over long enough is brilliant. I can clearly see how different the motivation would look to the audience. Instead we got something that is instantly dull.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I am not a fan of these types of movies, but OP has successfully convinced me to watch this particular one. Even if it wasn't their intention. :-)"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,This was quite literally one of the worst movie going experiences I had ever had
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"This movie honestly just proved to me what I‚Äôve always known- the #snyderverse fans are all talk and no doing. They‚Äôve begged for the Snydercut, and when they got it, not only did the film not perform on the site as well as it SHOULD have, but they immediately began their online ransack of trying to bring back the entire Snyderverse when Snyder himself had already said he was pretty much done with WB and DC after how sour their relationship turned during that really bad period of his life. Then after months of begging online for Henry Cavill to return as Superman- all these thousands upon thousands of fans who finally got their wish decided that supporting the film which granted them their wish just didn‚Äôt matter. You can claim that you want and that you‚Äôll support something online all you want but at the end of the day the only support that matters is at the box office. And WB has definitely taken notice of the fact that are all these fans not keeping their word to support the films and characters they desperately wanted, which proves to them that your online chatter and pleads mean nothing. And therefore they won‚Äôt feel the need to continue with the Snyderverse or Henry Cavill if they don‚Äôt want to. And best believe they do not want to. Because the only thing that probably got Cavill in the film was when the Rock said Superman wouldn‚Äôt be in the film and he got booed by everyone at that comic con panel."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"a reactionary hero. no goals in life, no commitments, no responsibilities. Doesn't even go looking for a fight just wants to react to them. Wow. If Black Adam were real he'd probably have a more fulfilling time on Twitter"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I think it would have helped tremendously if The Rock detransformed into a normal guy that could better act as his other. I was thinking Tony Shalhoub. Imagine the first act of the movie being him sneaking out of the tomb, living with the lady, and learning about what the bad guys have done, also explaining what happened and that he just wants to live because being a hero got his son killed. The bad guys do something unspeakable that spurns him on. No JLA, all that time goes to developing the villain as a death rock head basher who knows he is the heir to evil. The little boy is aged up and he's a friend of his."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,They should've made Black Adam part of the city like Superman in the 2006 game where his health bar is the city he protects. They could've made Black Adam like that. His enemies can attack the city and weaken him in a way AND gives The Rock something to do other than look stoic for [enter runtime] straight.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I think for the 1st point it doesn't always matter if your character is always pushed by the plot.

Look at Goku from Dragonball from the very start Goku has no goals and just pushed passively by the plot the entire time, that's why Goku basically get 0 character development throughout the entire story. He's still underestimate his enemies in super and letting his guard down in resurrection of F.

And yet Dragonball is one of the biggest franchises in the world, that is because the supporting characters are very strong (not literally) and villains are very compelling"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"12:13 Also some people often forget about this but Dr Fate is actually the original, Dr Strange was copied by Marvel and ended up becoming more popular thanks to his solo movie.
That's why Dr Fate is also cooler than Dr Strange, I hope Dr Fate will get a solo movie."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I actually had a really good time with this film despite the flaws, but my main complaint is why the hell does black Adam come out his prison after thousands of years and have a perfect American accent?"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I liked Joker, because it didn't have to have an ""evil Joker"" to go up against Joaquin Phoenix's character. It was just a character focused story where the bad guy wins. I'm curious how this movie would have liked if they had gone that direction"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Before watching the movie, I still kinda believe that The Rock can nail Black Adam character. Even though I also believe his acting skill is not really that good. Maybe he can do better because he REALLY want to play this character so bad.

Ho boy, how wrong I am lol. He make Black Adam literally a Terminator. For more context, I'm not a comic book reader. My only source for Black Adam character is Instagram post that sharing panel of Black Adam appearance in the comic and some random Youtube shorts. So not alot of sources. But yep, still not Black Adam. And I think it's not only The Rock fault, but also the writing of the character. I don't believe a better actor can save Black Adam if they stick to this one.

I still like the movie tho. I know what I'm gonna get and I won't ask for more. But I hope they fix Black Adam character on his next appearance, because this Black Adam is not interesting at all."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,man i really love your explanation. i treat this video like a lecture cause i'm trying to write my own story and your video give so much input to me. Thanks a lot! you just gain anew subscriber and a fan. keep going!
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"The movie was very enjoyable, although it had issues I feel like we shouldn't just declare it as a ""bad"" movie because of it.
I liked it.
Although for example, the kid's acting was quite bad, (the worst example being how in the last act he did (more like tried) the big calling thingy with the sign, like the kid at the begining while the kid at the begining actualy acted well)
Edit: finished the vid, yeah I agree with you again here. (it still was enjoyable but I know, it could be more than that)"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"Honestly, i agree with what have been said about the villain, but i'm actually okay with Adam being pushed around by the plot. He's not interested in what's happening because he's remorseful of what he did and in grief, with this movie being more of an origin story to kahndaq than to Black Adam, being talor made to show in future movies that this is a nation that you don't fuck with, kinda if we took the flashbacks from Namor in Black Panther 2 and turned into a whole movie."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I agree on some of your points but hopefully they can make it better in the sequel (if there ever is one) 
and its very artistically beautiful to look at"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm simplifying this but a lot of these problems could‚Äôve been fixed by sticking closer to cannon. Kahndaq always existed openly and Black Adam was always the head of state. His existence and powers are known. Haven‚Äôt seen him yet because he doesn‚Äôt leave Kahndaq and the main story of the DCU have taken place elsewhere. Also, you could add a subtle disdain for the Justice league for the threats they‚Äôve brought to earth that could‚Äôve threatened Kahndaq."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"This was a great movie, I‚Äôm very happy with the return of superman in the post credit ending. DC future looks bright can‚Äôt wait!"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,I liked it! I liked seeing a superhero actually being a badass and killing people! The way most superheroes would‚Ä¶..
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,Weird. This ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô isn‚Äôt in the jungle.
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I'm biased in saying this, but I loved this film because of its plot, or at least, its story themes. Whether intentional or not, it's a very pro-Palestinian film (to deny otherwise is cognitive dissonance) and honestly, that's really damn refreshing. Yes yes, the film still had its issues (as Filmento mentions) but that's something I think is worth cheering for."
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"I‚Äôve not seen it yet, partly because of the demonic character etc, but initially because I felt it would be generic‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve been proven right"
1,pPZrq-dL8xM,"What really pissed me off was how useless they made Dr Fate. He's supposed to be the most powerful sorcerer in DC, and they made him into a joke that did almost nothing. He didn't even wear the helmet that much...plus focusing on the annoying kid so much was painful to watch."
1,AYkIoGh5kuM,They need to do a top ten list of things worth more than buzzfeed shares
1,AYkIoGh5kuM,"Can't wait for the moment ""Another one bites the dust"" is played for Buzzfeed, Vice, & all these online media firms!"
1,AYkIoGh5kuM,Buzzfeed is dying and WHY THAT'S A GOOD THING- Buzzfeed

1,aWeCar1GT48,"Firstly, please keep in mind: this video has no political agenda. The only thing this is meant to do is to criticize stupid people in a stupid industry for doing stupid things and the only reason I decided to target women is because I believe it to be more personal for me than most things going on in the entertainment. It‚Äôs not meant to hate on feminism or feminists if anything I identify as one. 

I also want to address people constantly debating and assuming my political beliefs: in reality I‚Äôm just trying to talk about fiction and people who create it. It wounds me to read bunch of comments straight up accusing me of having some radical leaning towards all kinds and sides of political ideologies when I expressed none of it. Of course I have my own beliefs that I will keep private as for now since I believe them to be quite irrelevant when it comes to my channel but believe me when I say that my videos have always been a creative process for me and never political, and I would wish for people to respect that. If it comes across any other way, and it costs me a lot of anxiety that it might‚Ä¶that was never my intention and I‚Äôm sorry.

Lastly but importantly, if you think that this video is me hating on my gender or trying to appeal to someone‚Äôs misogynistic beliefs‚Ä¶you missed the point of this essay."
1,aWeCar1GT48,Advice: When you are doing representation of anybody make them human. Everyone has flaws.
1,aWeCar1GT48,I hate the new woke hollywood because I don‚Äôt hate that they‚Äôre featuring a female character it‚Äôs that they give her everything because she‚Äôs a female and so they just use it as a way to disregard any constructive criticism.
1,aWeCar1GT48,That one Powerpuff episode with the feminist supervillain is funnier and more culturally relevant than the entire runtime of She-Hulk.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"The problem with most ""strong female characters"" these days, is they are neither strong, nor particularly feminine, and they are barely characters."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"A scene that actually defined She-Hulk for me is the wedding scene where Jen always says in the show that people should like her for Jen rather than thinking she's cool because she is a hulk yet she walks in hulked up to her ""best"" friend's wedding to steal the spotlight for herself and then tells nobody likes her anyway.. And that time I related with NPC who didn't like her that had no names in the show than the protagonist who is supposed to make me feel bad for her struggles.. This is an example of bad writing in modern cinema.."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"In the end, I think it's really ironic that whenever someone complains about bad examples of feminism in media, we get called sexist. Despite the fact that the people who created said media tend to be someone who is too immature to talk about a sensitive and complicated subject such as sexism, or just doesn't care at all and just added it in for woke points. The worst part is, the ones who don't actually care, always goes back to stereotypes of both women and men because they are to creatively bankrupt to come up with their own story. Luckily it seems like we are coming out of the ""As long as it's representation, I don't care!"" area, and are becoming more mature when it comes to politics in general. As the old saying goes, ""Quality over Quantity."""
1,aWeCar1GT48,"The thing about She-Hulk's take on women and anger is that a good writer could've gotten that subtext across without being so on the nose about it and dismissing Bruce's trauma while at it (and I do wonder if part of the problem isn't just Marvel's insistence on having every line be a punchline these days. Characters are no longer fleshed out people with complex inner workings but rather a stand up routine). Off the top of my head: perhaps a scene before she's Hulk in which she's catcalled or something but she just clenches her jaw and walks on. And another after she's Hulk where the same thing happens but this time she notices herself turning green and realises it's not so easy to conceal her anger now. All this without spelling it out. She could be shown to have a slightly easier time than Bruce at handling her new condition without having the whole character and core conflict of the Hulk being insulted by her gaining control in a couple of days. Her finding it refreshing to be able wear her anger and emotions so outwardly, feeling comforted by new physical strength. Again without spelling it out. But they chose the most obvious and lazy ways to draw the parallels."

1,aWeCar1GT48,"Might as well use this as an opportunity to shout out Michelle MacLaren. She's done work on some of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead. She was originally slated to direct Wonder Woman and I hope she gets way more recognition and work."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"While Hollywood and the access media is busy patting itself on the back for the 'feminist message' it's puking out, Miyazaki has been writing 'strong female' characters for decades, that neither resort to acting like men, or humiliating men, as has Wong Kar-wai, and the audience doesn't feel hollow or disgusted by their art."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Once again, another banger video. Hopefully, we can return to people being hired on their character and merits and not superficial, unimportant nonsense. One day lol"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Ok but can we PLEASE talk about how She-Hulk has Steve's rear end as a lock screen?? Like, she hates men to objectify her but when she does it, somehow its funny?  and she even makes fun of his virginity and has the audacity to get mad at men for not taking her seriously when she can't take him seriously because he was to busy saving the world to sleep with anyone. This is why I watch kdrama ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"The last line made me empathize for you more than anything this ""woke"" Hollywood ladies did. It's a shame we have to live in such a reality, but it looks like everytime there's a struggle, there will people who DO NOT suffer from it still trying to use it for profit. We need more people like you to call it out and we need to make sure you're a listened... which is so harder these days, when going against the popular narrative has become such a detriment that people have to resort to writing essays and gain an audience on social medias just to share their thoughts without them being weaponized against them."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"It's a bleak world we live in, a world of madness and narcissism and division. I hate that it feels everything falls into the ""for me or against me"" or ""if you do/don't like this you're x"". I want things to be simple and for people to just try and be decent and improve themselves"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Two of my favourite fiction/fantasy writers are Jenny Mai-Nguyen (a Vietnamnese/German author) and Trudi Canavan (Australian, one of the most successful fantasy authors of our time). Hollywood is so busy with stunt casting and branding that they just end up hiring the authors/directors whose sole argument for hiring them is ""I am a woman""."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"As a young girl, the animated mulan was so epic and inspiring. As an adult, the live action one made me roll my eyes so hard! The difference between the 2 movies is, for me, the perfect example of how boring and infuriating at the same time feminist Hollywood is. I miss characters like Ripley or even rose from titanic. Characters that felt human and happened to be women."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Eloquent, passionate, and above all right minded. You're a treasure, Nutsa."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Thank you for putting this into words. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, between the camps of self-victimization and/or shallow, PSA-grade storytelling. Good writing is universal. Can't differences in experience be acknowledged without putting some on a pedastal or kicking others down?"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"One of my favorite female characters recently is Annie/Starlight on The Boys. She‚Äôs funny, tough, has a whole arsenal of mental and emotional baggage but she still believes in herself and her moral compass and tries to do the right thing and protect the people she loves. The entire series is filled with women, some good, some bad, some in-between, but all fascinating . I think a lot of these complaints come from highly popular properties (usually owned by Disney) that want to offend the least amount of people possible and end up being completely bland. Branch outside of Disney (hard I know) and you‚Äôll find plenty of well-written female characters that don‚Äôt feel beholden to Tumblr and Twitter warriors."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Oh Norm, you were so good you can even give PTSD to a person even after death."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"As a guy I must say I absolutely love your content. I don't pay mind if it's a woman or a man behind what I'm watching as long as it values my time. Lucy is one of my favourite movies of all time and it proves all a writer needs to write a well written female protagonist is not balls of steel and a twitter account but instead passion, creativity and well executed expressions of emotions. 

Like with lots of movies nowadays it's only good when the story was always good but just happens to star a woman. ((Unless the story requires a woman protagonist to work, but that's the only real exception. And no I don't mean that in the way of ""you don't know what it's like to be me!"" ... even that could work, every plan could work it's about execution after all but clearly the writers are lacking in that department)) 

Anyways same can be said about your channel. The content was always good it just happens to star you. And to be honest I really like you so far so keep it up!"
1,aWeCar1GT48,That closing sentence was spot on. What a great way of looking at a really weird time in history. Thank you for being bold in such a judgemental culture.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Very well written, eye opening essay! I found myself agreeing with basically everything if not mistaken, great as always!"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Your stuff is always spot on, but the fact you weaved Norm in is pure gold."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Your video essays delve deeper than most when related to movies and tv. I really appreciate how thought out and clear they are with editing that is wonderfully paired with what is being said. Hopefully one day the industry hires capable people who happen to be women, storytellers that understand the craft and don‚Äôt use any agenda to force you to go watch it. If a project is legitimately good it will speak for itself. Maybe an up and coming female storyteller / filmmaker will see your vids and become inspired to create a genuinely great piece of work that overshadows the loudness of Hollywood. Go Nutsa, big fan of your work and editing!

-Starc0unter"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I have no idea how I‚Äôm just now finding you, this video was damn good.

You articulated your points very well, and I agree with all of it. Specifically how these female Hollywood elites feel as though they are somehow the heroes of the story by indulging in their own self-absorbed narcissism.

Not that it should matter if you were a man instead, but the fact that you are a women who speaks out against this narrative they‚Äôve been pushing is enough to prove that they cannot speak on behalf on one entire gender. All it takes is one person to shatter their argument, because women are *individuals*, and you are one of the most sharp and well-spoken I‚Äôve seen in a long time. You‚Äôre like a breath of fresh air, thank you for this."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I LOVE THIS. Totally agree. Modern media is so condescending towards women, said as a woman myself. Most characters, 1. Act like men, hence cannot portrait women (superheroes movies have a ton of this), 2. See themselves as victims by talking about stupid problems that aren't problems at all in the real world, 3. Act like children. Hate all of that. I can't see myself in such imbecile characters!
I'd like to see realistic/funny/insighful movies about motherhood, female friendship, relationships, or about women in actual super patriarchal societies (islamic countries maybe?). You know, actual female issues in the world. In the last few years Lady Bird is the only ""feminist"" film I liked for those reasons; I loved the relationship between mom and daughter
When my daughter grows up and she can watch movies, I'll for sure make her skip this stupid era we're in right now, including cartoon movies in the past few years which I have found very toxic."
1,aWeCar1GT48,The problem is that they do characters with their whole personality based off the fact that they are a certain religion or gender instead of good characters that happen to be a female of whatever they want
1,aWeCar1GT48,I‚Äôm so sick of being pandered to. Thank you for putting into words everything I hate about woke Hollywood.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Great video, love the editing. 

You hit on something I've noticed myself, and I mean in myself, in there. It's this chilling effect this sort of incompetence has, and when it comes to people it's similar to one of the major downfalls of ""equity"", such as in Affirmative Action. Sure, there are lots of qualified people out there who meet the requirements of your quota, whatever it is, but if you can't find one of them and are forced to hire someone who isn't exactly the best qualified candidate and they then do a bad job it reinforces the old stereotypes in the end, thus potentially making it harder for future people in that group to get a job there.

It also impacts media in that you see all of this drivel with a ""Strong Female Character"" in the lead and it makes people begin to expect other media with a female lead to be drivel as well. This is where I've really noticed it in myself, and I hate it. I love a lot of stories with female leads, but now whenever I see one announced I'm immediately and automatically skeptical. I hate that they've done this to me, that they've made me dread the thought of Mara Jade being brought back into Star Wars or what they might do with a female 00 agent, which is something I would have loved to see Emily Blunt doing a decade ago.

That's it, though, _they_ did this, this is what they've done to all the ""evil"" straight white men like myself who grew up loving characters like Ripley, Sarah Connor and Lara Croft. It's only by sheer will that I can maintain even a partially open mind for new female lead media that comes along, and they sure aren't making it easy when they can do such a disservice to both She-Hulk and the incredibly talented actress playing her (Tatiana Maslany was so good in Orphan Black) in one fell swoop."
1,aWeCar1GT48,I like how they never try to portray a struggle of a single mom. I even once wrote brief story about just that thinking what if my mom lost my father to a war and had to be homeless. I gotta say it came out better than any of these portrayals of women. I only seen it portrayed briefly in Zack Snyder's Justice League. And truly I believe that has more material to work with than a cAlIFoRnIAn rich Single women in her late mid-life.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"you're becoming my fav female youtuber who talks about Hollywood mainly because you sound like someone with critical thinking and a well balanced moral compass, most are harcode left or right who lean waaaaaay too hard into one direction, it's either ""Hollywood atm is so amazing and diverse"" or ""Woke Hollywood is poisoning the water to create gay people"" and those opinions leave 0 room for discussions."

You've got a serious knack for communication and this essay on a large and critically important topic was expertly worded and beautifully presented. Keep up the great work; the more people like you who put out work like this, perhaps the greater likelihood there is of making some headway against this most recent form of Hollywood degeneration."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"You know, this was really good to see. You clearly know what you are talking about and what you are doing. So tired of seeing unqualified people get so much say in things simply by being popular. It's so rare to see someone genuinely discuss something like this without taking a side or having an ulterior motive. 
You talk about how this stuff is bad film without ever giving the implication you don't think female producers are the equals of male ones. You talk about misogyny and stuff without the ""men bad"" message. It's so clear, anyone who thinks you are attacking one gender or another is deceiving theirself.
Sometimes it seems like classical feminism is dead, and no one wants equality anymore. That it is just misogyny vs female superiority. Because of that, seeing someone else who believes in equality like I do is so encouraging. So tired of seeing people just lash out at the opposite gender in an endless cycle when literally all you have to do is treat others like freaking human beings.

Anyway just wanted to say, in my humble opinion, this is really good. People need this. And however insignificant one person is, it is really encouraging for me to see this."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Great work Nutsa!
As a man, I've always found difficult explaining this to women because I'm inmediatley mansplaining. I recently watched Prey (from the Predator franchise) with some female friends and had a mixed feeling about it, though I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was. 
There are lots of good media representing women (like Hayao Miyazaki's anime films) but, thinking about it, I think I've only read a female take on female characters in the Harry Potter series and watched Brit Marling's stuff... 
I would recommend you to do a piece on your 'favorite female representation in fiction by women' and another '...by men' (specially fantasy and sci-fi). If you like graphic novel, I'm recently enjoying Brian K. Vaughan's 'Y the Last Man' and very much liked his 'Saga' (still ongoing)."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"At this point I'm just happy that there are characters like Jessica Jones that show that you can write a female protagonist that makes their gender relevant but not the plot, who are relatable, well written yet still having problems in their lives."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"If I may, I really like the editing; always something to see that is in link to what you are saying, I want to watch your video instead of just listening to it. The script is very well written, I'm now gonna watch the rest of the content on your channel. Thank you."
1,aWeCar1GT48,I met you because of EFAP and since then I've never been disappointed by your videos. There's always something you can say about them that's of very high quality. Also you can never go wrong with a Norm joke.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I really like your videos on this channel. You point out what's wrong with hollywood, in a very fair and thought out way. You're not going on a rant about something, you're just saying things how they are. I wish more people were like that"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Very impressive, you have knowledge, which is a big compliment considering so many people of todays age lack the ability to step out of their delusions. Your channel deserves more recognition."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Your Editing is FU*KING Bang On Nutsa! and love your narrative voice.‚ù§Ô∏è

Came across your channel from EFAP, and Loved your appearances there.

1,aWeCar1GT48,"""Make sure to make the movies first and femminist second"" One hell of a quote."
1,aWeCar1GT48,You and Procrastitara need to do a podcast or a video together because you both have really good takes on feminist Hollywood bullshit. (Also you both have really calming voices)
1,aWeCar1GT48,"THANK YOU!  After watching 'Wonder Woman', I was excited to for more women to write/direct, particularly, comic book adaptations...  But gatDAM!  It feels like we regressed to Batman Forever/Steel/Batman & Robin/Daredevil/Hulk (2003)/Fantastic Four (2005)/Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer/Ghost Rider/Jonah Hex/Iron Man 2/Green Lantern/Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (all written/directed by men) levels of underwhelming.  Albeit, those movies had some scenes that I like to revisit, even if it's to laugh at.  Women have not written scenes in CBAs that I want to go back to and have fun with.  They are even too depressingly bad to be ""so bad it's good"".  How did Patty Jenkins having more control over WW1984's story than she did with WW1918 lead to a more convoluted story with an unconscious man's body being used for sex?!  WTF?!?!?!

Taskmaster was basically written like Bane in Batman & Robin. Yet the plot for Antonia set her up to be Natasha's most intense adversary who needed to not be mind controlled, to allow Olga Kurylenko's acting to bounce off of Scarlett's, and make a woman damaged by Natasha's actions so determined to get revenge on her that she'd use skills from the Avengers to take her on, making Antonia scary.  Plus, she should've represented women who traffick others.

Captain Danvers (Marvel) is so powerful, we can't watch her be challenged in combat after regaining her memories.  Ya know, the scenes that raise the stakes and, knowing the hero will win, you make the hero get beat down enough to show what they can mentally do when getting back up.  Tobey's Spider-Man vs Willem's Green Goblin come to mind, as well as Cavill's Superman vs Shannon's Zod.  Plus, Nick Fury's eye got catscratched, not messed up by a Skrull nor Kree or something more meaningful...  Unforgivable.

She-Hulk's most interesting moments were in the first episode, meanwhile, Jessica Jones, a more well-handled female-led, female showran, mostly female-written CBA stayed interesting throughout episodes unlike nearly every other CB series written/showran by women which treated women, men, boys, girls, like we should divide based on body parts, and only unite in a goofy/uninspiring fashion.  Meanwhile, Ms. Marvel and (especially) Stargirl do not disappoint, they were mostly written by men.

Eternals' most interesting moments were the team talking with each other and the Celestials.  Beyond that, why is it so droll?  Plus, Kingo isn't Japanese and Gilgamesh isn't Middle Eastern like they're supposed to be.  Other than not giving her red hair, I kinda give Makkari a pass, she's portrayed as a new character with Makkari's aspects.  Albeit, I would have used Titanus, already Afro (black) and super strong/fast, they don't want us to have both.

In the past few years of MCU movies/shows, even if not absolutely great, they still kept us interested in what was happening.  She-Hulk, Captain Marvel, Eternals, Black Widow have no excuse for being the least interesting nor having the most confusing writing choices.

Let alone DC movies.  Birds of Prey's choices are way more infuriating than any other simply by what Cassandra Cain is.  Like, naw, y'all ain't gonna get rid of Cassie's badassery, her being the daughter of Lady Shiva and not make Shiva a villain or the main villain and EXPECT US TO BE OK WITH THAT SHET!  Only good part was Harley, Renee, Dinah, Helena being in the same room, which was too short!

And lastly, I LOVE Netflix's The Punisher, the Thomas Jane movie is a guilty pleasure (especially with his fight scene with stripe shirt), Punisher: War Zone with Ray Stevenson, kept me drowsy.  I later learned a woman directed it.  Didn't have any feminazisms, it's just a nothing burger.

Men who suck at CBAs will come but the men who rock stay in the midst.  When is our next banger from women?  I won't lose all hope, so I want 'The Marvels' and 'Madame Web' to change things up.  Because SHEESH!"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"This is an excellent video essay! More impressive is that you're so young with this mindset. Please, continue to produce this great work! Thank you!"
1,aWeCar1GT48,I think the best movie I‚Äôve watched that was directed by a woman was ‚ÄúUnbroken.‚Äù I love that movie and there isn‚Äôt a single moment where masculinity is labeled toxic. If anything the movie says the opposite
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Great video as always! 

I'd love to hear you expand on how Greta Gerwig portrays her characters and how it works so well! I was skeptical going into her take on ""Little Women"", but fell in love with it!"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"This is an extremely well constructed video. There are some really insightful opinions in here, and I appreciate the depth of these arguments. To pipe in, I find that at the end of the day, this rapid influx of terribly-written woke media seems to be really targeted at ""representation"", and the creators of these media pieces respectively seem to believe that the quality of their media is predicated on how many labels they can put on a character, such as woman etc. It seems like the creators of such media think that they can get away with creating completely inhuman characters that personify stereotypical issues in various minority groups and still have the expectation that such inhuman media is relatable, or even enjoyable to every person watching. I think these days, the hasty actions of the media to value representation over quality are to some extent, perpetuating the toxic stereotypes that these minority groups have to deal with. I think a quote that really represents this is ""A man is the sum of his actions, of what he has done, of what he can do, Nothing else."" -John Galsworthy, and to that extent, I believe that these characters need to be humans, whom can counter these stereotypes through strength of will, and through actions, not by simply saying that they counter stereotypes without actually exemplifying a way in which the character may do that. It is one thing to say that this character is a ""strong, independent woman"", and another to show how she became independent, through her actions and through adversity, the latter character-type would actually demonstrate to people how these stereotypes are false and, I believe, would do more to help improve the lives of prejudiced individuals out there in the world."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"The thing that irks me about She-Hulk was the part when Jen said to Hulk that he was mansplaining about how to control the Hulk powers through emotion. She was so disrespectful to him, I mean come on put some respect to a brilliant scientist who is just there to help her control her powers because he knows it himself that Hulk powers are destructive.

It's just sad that in today's world experience, opinions and insights of a professional man is just considered as mansplaining."
1,aWeCar1GT48,Wow. Using the 3 beats of that Norm joke to begin each of the 3 parts to the video was brilliant and artfully done. Norm was my favorite comedian of all time. I suspect he himself would've agreed with the points you made. I wasn't aware of your channel til today and this is the first video of yours I've seen but I'll be a regular watcher from now on.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Congratulations for the quality of your essay. You expressed very well and for most people it should be clear what you are doing here.

Others will not pay attention except for the parts where you say things that are easy to edit and put out of context and that's a real sample of how this modern society is too comfortable. Good ending sentence.

Listo, termin√© de ver tu video essay. Keep up the good work, mate!üññü§ì"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"You did incredible work again, and this is a great continuation of your Feminist Hollywood video.  Without a damn doubt there's so many factors to explore, and the Weinstein/MeToo maelstrom that turned Hollywood into a shitshow needs ALL the exploration.  What troubles me the most is the fact that Harvey couldn't have been the only criminal who preyed on women using his power and authority.  We've all heard of 'The Casting Couch', right?  He couldn't have been the ONLY one taking advantage of others in criminal ways, could he?  How many young ladies -- or dammit, younger? -- have been told that they might be cast for a film or considered for a record label or be a prominent part of another project IF...and use your imagination for what they'd be asked to give, and if an unknown hopeful is fortunate, all they'd have to lose is some dignity.  But even that's too damn much.

All of this virtue signalling from the cultural elite, these vapid men *and* women barking and clapping like woke trained seals in a circus, may just be to keep the rest of the world from hearing all the rattling in THEIR closets...the only difference between them and the likes of Weinstein is, they haven't been caught.  Yet.  I can only suspect that, though.

I have really had enough of this monetizing and profiting from victimhood, too.  Like you, when I go to see a movie or a TV show or whatever, I just want to be entertained.  I want to escape from B.S., not be hammered over the head with it by those who fail upward thanks to the postmodern elites like Iger, Chapek, Kennedy, and more who are trying to profit themselves by saying, ""Look at us and how wonderful we are!  We're hiring more people like YOU if you're in the right victim group!  This will ensure you'll feel INCLUDED!""  I've never seen so many people get away with being so damn insulting using the cloak of so-called 'social justice'.

On a bright note, we've seen time and time again that 'going broke' isn't just a truism for being woke, it's virtually guaranteed.  We have been showing Hollywood how we feel by our increasingly NOT spending our money and keeping them rich.  (It's taken a lot of folks to come around, though, I'm sorry to say!)  The elite can either choose to make money or burn in their own politically driven dumpster fire...I'm sure at least for their futures, they'll make the right choice."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"This needs waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more exposure. Do you want me to watch your movie? Write a character that  care about with, oh, I don't know .... character development instead of plot armour?  Seriously.  So many of these 'strong woman' lead characters are written with characteristics that, if they were male, would classify them as outright assholes and have them shunned by society. I'm supposed to watch and enjoy that?

Oh, and if I do something like exercise my right to free speech and criticize the work for lazy af writing, I'm now a misogynist? Fuck that noise."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"A masterpiece as always. I think it is sad that so many additional explanations are obligatory when your mindset and your principles are so crystal clear. Although, I dare say that claiming that cat-calling itself is a huge issue is quite ridiculous."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Everything I‚Äôve been trying to put into words for YEARS. Thank you so much for this, it was extremely eloquent."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"One thing I also dislike, is when a movie cant be criticize because ""Well, the protagonist is a woman/women, and if you talk bad about it, you are an - ism"". Or the classic marketing of ""This is the 1st (insert movie genre) with a female led!"" when it's obviously not. 

That is not counting the amount of movies that are just gender bender worse versions of a previous movies, which is just lazy."
1,aWeCar1GT48,Great video. I really just want a good story and good characters. I don‚Äôt have to like a movie‚Äôs message or themes as long as I come away thinking it was at least well made or interesting. I may say I didn‚Äôt like it in the end but I can see the merit in why it exists and why others may like it.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"It's tough criticizing creatives of the same race, ethnicity or gender. You're expected to choke down whatever they squeeze out in order to somehow confirm your solidarity with their political agenda, and noncompliance with that norm is viewed as a betrayal of the community. I very much appreciate the integrity and adeptness in which you explain how your criticisms come not out of spite for women, (obviously) but from a place of hope for female film makers to succeed beyond the superficial. Well researched, edited and spoken, as always."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"To be honest I always thought the term ""pick me girl"" came about because the term ""Slut"" is no longer social acceptable. They surve the same function in calling other women ""damaged."""
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Oh my god, each chapter is named after a punchline to one joke. It's so simple but cool. Like, clever cool. I cannot emphasise how much my mind is blown"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"So, after watching the whole vid. I can‚Äôt but agree with everything. Fortunately, not being on socials are nice.. so I forgot about a lot of this stuff but yeah.. sounds about how things are in those,‚Ä¶ social bubbles."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Your video style is unique and enjoyable, very good work. I'm not in LOVE with it or anything but it's just incredibly refreshing to have a such a well made video to watch. Thank you"
1,aWeCar1GT48,I glad that I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks labelling every girl with alternate views a ‚Äúpick me girl‚Äù is dumb.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Well thought out, and excellently executed, very well done."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"It's funny because Jessica Jones came out way before She-Hulk, tackled much heavier issues, and was much more well-received."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Subscription earned. I'm happy to see that there are some people who just want GOOD art and don't care about the gender/sex of the person who produced it. The art should always come first. If it is worthy of praise, it will be praised."
1,aWeCar1GT48,the show barry tackles this subject very well! it isn‚Äôt the main plot but ONE of the main plots and is delivered with nuance and tact you just don‚Äôt see anywhere nowadays.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Love the aesthetic of this video! Great points as well. God rest Norm MacDonald, what an absolute comedy legend"
1,aWeCar1GT48,The Jennifer Lawrence thing actually blows my mind. Chris Pratt definitely has more screen time than she does in Passengers.
1,aWeCar1GT48,"""The moment a woman hold power in her hand, she goes crazy with it""
Our grandfathers and their stereotypes aren't wrong they are just born at the wrong time and hold back the wrong people"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I'm so glad I came across your channel. I'm a published author and I often write stories with female leads. And I agree with you; it's not about gender first. It's about your character's humanity. You need to get that one right, before you dig into gender."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"What do you mean? She Hulk is truly one of the shows of all time.
I loved when she said ""Is hulking time"" and started to Hulk all around the place.


Now getting serious, I think the worst thing about this media is that they shield themselves behind X and Y ideology, so when they get critcized they can use the almighty counterargument: ""Oh You don't like our show?, you must be a [Redacted]"", like yeah, maybe I don't like your show, and maybe there's someone out there who doesn't like your show and likes to throw pies at people, but this doesn't imply that I also like to throw pies. 
The problem is: in the process of cowering behind the movement and letting it take all the hits, they are damaging the image of the same movements they claim to ""reperesent"". But they don't care they'll just keep sucking it's blood like leeches till someone pulls them off."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Coming from this video, woke feminism seams to be like the dark side of the force:
- it grants great power. 
-uses fear to control people. 
-is ultimately self destructive and counter productive."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I always say that the main primary goal of any filmmaker, screenwriter, and whatever creative should be to MAKE A GOOD/ENTERTAINING PRODUCT and then worry about diversity after.

As long as the product itself is good, it will speak on its own regardless of its themes, messages, and politics. If anything, it will make it easier to communicate said ideas to groups who wouldnt normally agree with you or at least help them understand where you are coming from.

Why is it that She Hulk gets harshly ridiculed while HBOs Harley Quinn is heavilly beloved and praised?  They are both female lead shows with diverse casts and very honest progressive messages.  The difference is that Harley Quinn focused on being a good show first and worried about politics second.

Ladies I wanna ask: what sounds like a more entertaining and empowering story you wanna follow:

A privelaged upperclass woman with a highclass job dealing with first world lady problems and her biggest enemy is Reddit

Or

A woman rising in the ranks of the criminal underworld to get back at her abuser while getting into all sorts of chaotic shenanigans with her new loving healthy partner"
1,aWeCar1GT48,"As a friend of mine said in the 90s when I was complaining about a feminist who altered my life in a terrible way: Real feminists don't hate men damn it! We love our men and boys. Anyone saying otherwise isn't a feminist, they're just hateful."
1,aWeCar1GT48,the editing of this video has more quality than all of these woke Hollywood movies combined.

1,aWeCar1GT48,I can‚Äôt get over how calming your accent is. And great video!
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Great video. Nerdrotic just did a video touching on the NYP article and obviously came at it from a similar point of view. I think most people just want quality entertainment, but Hollywood the past several years has been uniquely vulnerable to these... what to even call them, anti-feminists?... who rely disproportionately on their gender or the current social climate to advance their careers, thus making a mockery of the very because they claim to work in service towards. No doubt, there are many talented women in the entertainment industry, but far too many are using their gender as a shield against completely valid criticism. As a man, if I were to critique these people, I'd be called a misogynist (no, I am not), so it is very important to have other women call out this behavior as I feel my voice and opinion would be discounted on account of MY gender, but other women are to some degree insulated from this sort of counter-critique.

TL;DR: Great work, would watch again."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"""as a woman I feel an obligation to support my gender through and through."" 


Why? Why do you do this when men don't? Why don't they? Now imagine if they did."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"I really don't understand why people need to represent a gender, an ethnicity or even a sexuality as superior. 
We are all Human and I'm just proud what Humanity as a whole achieved, and that we all have different backgrounds. 
But some people seem to see only one side of things. Unfortunately, influential people tend to fall into that category in a desperate attempt to be seen as tolerant, while they're being the exact opposite."
1,aWeCar1GT48,Great video! This was a well made statement. ‚ÄúHuman first‚Äù is a good takeaway for anyone looking to write real vs strong characters.

1,aWeCar1GT48,"Personally, as a woman, I get so tired of the whole ‚Äúman bad woman good‚Äù crap media tries to push. I know there‚Äôs this whole thing about young women saying ‚ÄúI hate men‚Äù whenever they try to go into the dating market or whatever, which I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs where the sentiment came from, however it just a completely childish way of looking at things. Do these women not have fathers, brothers, sons or any other male in their lives? My father is a wonderful man who had done so much for me and still continues to do so, I watched him struggle through being a single parent and having to deal with my mother‚Äôs bs. I watched him struggle with two jobs he had back to back and even though he had to go through that whole thing while raising a child, he had neither child support or government help. He never limited what I could do just because of my gender, the most I could say he has expected from me is to get a good job and to give him grandkids, though I feel like that‚Äôs any parent‚Äôs desires. 

I want stories where men and women work together, because we each have our unique abilities. So many older movies seemed to have understood that but apparently having a woman work with/help a man makes her ‚Äúwithout agency‚Äù or something stupid. I don‚Äôt need female characters to have an arbitrary amount of dialogue or screen time, that doesn‚Äôt make a character a good character. I don‚Äôt need men to be stupid and incompetent just to make the female characters ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, I want to see men that are good at their craft so I can identify what a desirable man is. Essentially what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I don‚Äôt want women be stereotypically masculine, and men stereotypically feminine or whatever the hell, I want them to be humans, I want to know their fears, desires, strengths and weaknesses, I don‚Äôt want a caricature. 

I feel like one of the best animated shows was Justice League Unlimited, all the character worked off each-other perfectly, and the stories were interesting. I wish we could go back to those types of story telling instead whatever this modern crap is. Why would I want to be reminded of the ‚Äúhardship of women‚Äù every damn time I turn on the TV? It‚Äôs like if I‚Äôd watch the news to get entertained, it‚Äôs fucking batshit. Of course those types of themes can be inserted in a good and subtle fashion but they‚Äôre totally inept at that."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"You do a fantastic job on your videos. 

Hollywood has found that they can profit from a culture of grievances.  This fascination with the grievances takes the focus away from solutions and places it on wollowing in the issue.  It also changes their communication.  They lecture the audience and us exposition to highlight the grievance rather than communicating sn experience.  It also means that the hire and place talent based on grievance not ability.  This degrades the quality of the output and movies but even worse it means that they don't support women based on talent.  They support them based on the axe they have to grind and how loudly the will grind it.   If they simply supported women based on talent they would solve much of the problems in front of the camera and behind it."

""Make the movie first and the feminism second""

EXACTLY! I have no problem with movie producers trying to convey a message, even if I disagree with that message. First, just tell a good story! I didn't pay for a movie ticket and popcorn to be lectured to about feminism, racism, sexual orientations, etc."
1,aWeCar1GT48,What many of these people fail to realize is that a lot of us aren't criticizing the idea of representation; we're criticizing its execution.

1,aWeCar1GT48,"I feel sad that the quality of entertainment has spiraled into this mess. I felt happy initially when woke media began to spread since I believe this would the turning point when women would finally get what they have long been overdue - equal and fair representation. I had no idea it would lead to the situation we see in 2022.
But, there is a positive side to this. Quality content creators are watching, learning and understanding what is fair and what is ""pushing it""; and when the clutter falls apart, there will be better content will emerge - one that has an agenda and that's good quality content with better and fair representation and not simply because of a person's skin color or gender or origin or vengeance for what their ancestors had to experience."
1,aWeCar1GT48,"Why was 6 afraid of 7? It's a fairly common question, mostly because when people see 6 and 7 next to each other, it doesn't really make sense. 6 is large, muscled, and trained in multiple martial arts, while 7 is fairly average, physically, and short. However, 6's fear of 7 has its roots in childhood. See, 6 and 7 grew up together, and for a few years, they were best friends. But then 6 kissed 3, and they became childhood sweethearts. 7 secretly had feelings for 3, so 7 decided he needed to destroy 6 to win 3's affection. He started subtly, undermining 6 whenever possible with passive aggressive comments and compli-sults. But over time, things got much more insidious. 7 started messing with 6's performance in school, bringing down his grades and turning teachers against him. Even worse, 7 became great friends with 6's parents and slowly turned them against their own offspring. At night, 7 would sneak into 6's bedroom, and whisper depressing and hopeless things into his ears. Every time 3 was around, 7 would pants 6 and make fun of his genitalia, or try to body shame him in other ways. However, 3 was both smart and compassionate, and saw through 7's schemes, sticking with 6, trying to counter 7's psychological tear-down with compliments and friendship. Finally, 7 decided that he would never be able to win 3, so he drugged both 6 and 3, taking them to an abandoned cobbler's hut on the edge of town. There, he proceeded to torture and maim 3, forcing 6 to watch in horror, unable to do anything to save his sweetheart. 7 didn't kill 3, but instead, put her in a semi-vegetative state. 7 cleaned the scene of his prescence, then called the cops, having 6 blamed for 3's condition. 6 was sent to prison, believing 6 was guilty, 6's parents fell into a deep depression, eventually committing suicide over what they believed 6 had done. After serving 17 years of a 30 year sentence, and getting out on good behaviour, 6, now muscled and skilled as a fighter, thought he might get revenge on 7. But when he finally tracked down 7, he found out that 7 had installed a micro-bomb into 3's body, and should he be killed, the bomb would automatically go off and kill 3 as well. And though she was still in a mostly fugue state, 6 couldn't bring himself to hurt her any further, and decided to try and move on with his life. However, being an ex-con, it was difficult for him to get a job. 6 finally found employment at a diner, which 7 then bought, and proceeded to again undermine and toy with 6 at every turn. 6 tried to find employment elsewhere, but 7 contacted any potential employer and soured them against 6. 6 finally realized that no matter what he did, 7 was going to try and ruin his life, and he resigned himself to living as a broken, lonely man, never able to stand up to the depraved, amoral 7."

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"This is the reason we wear crocs. 

Stay strong boys and don't forget to change into speed mode.‚ö°Ô∏è"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Bro, Money for Nothing needs to be used in more shorts, it worked so well"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,When that 1 creepy uncle actually helps you:
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"His uncle is the hero that doesn't wear cape, and everyone loves that."
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Bro how are you always soo relatable, it's actually ridiculous"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Man, me and Jack have so much in common. Our uncle's both can't be 100 ft near the school ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Healthy advice to people who are getting bullied : 
Remember that bullies are people who are also human and are people who feel very insecure about themselves and this causes them to cause aggravated assault both physical and mental 
Remember that they are way worse off than you"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,We gotta realize how good of a runner he is if he‚Äôs running with a backpack on
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to find out why I have to stay 100 feet from the school boy‚Äù üë¥üèª
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I love that you used money for nothing for this! Such an underrated song and riff. Probably the greatest intro to any song ever. Respect.
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,That took such a turn from what I thought was going to happen üòÇ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I love his content you never disappoint
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Are we just not going to talk about Jack‚Äôs new giga profile pic?
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I love it when my uncle comes to the rescue and then proceeds to come all over everybody
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,That one had me off guard üíÄ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"""My Uncle who isn't allowed within 100 feet of a school""
üóø"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Money for nothing has the best guitar of all time. It‚Äôs too giga for anyone
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,It‚Äôs always great win your nice uncle comes in clutch at the right moment‚ò∫Ô∏è
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Uncle is always there for you üòÇüòÇ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I didn‚Äôt expect that ending thoüòÇ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,That last bit. That was perfect
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I can't even just make my crocs phase through like that fast asf
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,You‚Äôre gonna have to run back in a couple moments there though
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"And on the very same day, uncle found himself a new boyfriend who's strangely younger than him."
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,wait so i used my crocs in speed mode this entire time? no wonder i got hired as an olympic cameraman
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Great taste in music!!..Dire Straits hits hard
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,This gave me a good chuckle
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Unrealistic, the Crocs in sports mode should have allowed him to *dominate* that bully in a race!"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,No one gon talk about how he did the non moving runs with only 1 leg moving
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,i love that he‚Äôs created a JCU (Jack Cinematic Universe)
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Me wondering why he‚Äôs running away 101 feet instead of 100
Realizing that his grandpa is the pickle tickler from 2015"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Me running from my older brother be like:
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,This video touched me more than my uncle
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Sport Crocs mode had meü§£
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,The crocs: Yeah let me just magically go to sport mode rq he's gonna need it
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,that one uncle: *beast mode activated* üí•üåù
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"""turn my lights down and my LEDs redüòè""

yes, I got LEDs in my classroom"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Uncle: Oh look you dropped something when you dropped your bag
Kid: **Turns and slightly bends** 
Uncle:üòèüòà"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Here‚Äôs the big question what did he do to get put 100 feet away from the school.
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Well looks like uncle is the most feared one in the entire area that the school said - ""Ay man you have to stay 100 ft away from school aight?"""
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Me realizing what he meant about not being allowed 100 ft near the school‚ÄùüíÄ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Keep playing this type of music, 70‚Äôs 80‚Äôs 90‚Äôs!"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Man the uncle is finally useful than looking at us under the bed
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Great job on the video it‚Äôs really funny!

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,We all know that u gotta put the crocs in comfy mood after
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"I just tell my dad and he says ‚Äúbeat ‚Äòem up then‚Äù so I gave a kid a fractured lung,back,skull,balls,wristüíÄ"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,You are a Gigajack for using this sound üòÉ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Bro uncle always their for u
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I have an aunt which always helps me in these types of situations because all of my uncles are dead.
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"""When there's a hole there's always a goal.""

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,In reality no one catches up with you when your Crocs are in sports mode
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"This is my fav bwajack short yet 
Not just because it's rlly funny but because it uses one of my fav songs 'Money for Nothing' by dire straits"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Sir, you have summoned me"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Bully: ""Jokes on you im into that shit!"""
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Love how theres always a watermark in the background picü§£
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,hes father didn't protect him because he left to get milküíÄ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Care to elaborate on why he isn‚Äôt allowed within 100 feet of the school?ü§®
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Poor child üëÅüëÑüëÅ bro going to get humbled quickly üò¨
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,The watermark makes it 100x better üòÇ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I just fought my own battles usually verbally bc I'd rather not use violence if possible
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Alas, it was too late. He ended up üçá- ing the bully."
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Always got to chuck the crocs in sport mode.
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"The bullie scares me, he caught up to sports mode crocs"

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I freaking love this song
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,my uncle always tells me that as long as i play his games he will always protect me üòÅ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I like how its an oddly specific number ü§£ü§£
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,That turned real dark really fucking fast üíÄ
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Bro a normal person cant catch up to sports mode its physically impossible
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,What you have that he never tried to bully anyone 100 ft away from the school
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Bro forgot to evolve the crocs to black air forces üíÄüíÄüíÄ

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,Love ur video keep up the good work üòä
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,why is the uncle  only allowed to be 100 feet away from the school???ü§®
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,I also did the sport mode with the crocs when I was a kid that was so fun
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,POV: you did the math wrong and did 99
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,‚Äúwe have some touching to do!‚Äù
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Check out what else is new on HBO Max here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSduohp5OGX4LfgHLn8SC-Cn5r3xXxSZD
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Most of us already know how this story ends, so it's gonna be up to this two actors and their chemistry to make us care for them like it's our first time experiencing this journey."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"just over here crying. tlou is such a personal, important series for me, and this looks absolutely stunning. i cannot wait to watch this over and over again!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Pedro Pascal has a talent playing characters with tough exteriors who are trying to transport children across long distances slowly starting to love that child like his own despite seeing them merely as cargo at the beginning of the journey.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,1:43 just that one little line from Henry is perfection. They really nailed the game on seemingly every level from everything shown so far. This show will be a massive success
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Considering the scene at 1:33 is no bait, it will be very emotional to see Ashley Johnson (the actress who played Ellie in the games) giving birth to Ellie. Such a full circle moment."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Having Ashley play Ellie's mom is perfect. I almost cried seeing that split second of her. And the girl playing Ellie could easily be Ashley's daughter. Nicely done.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I literally get goosebumps everytime I watch this trailer‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm so terrified I‚Äôm gonna be let down, but I haven‚Äôt found anything wrong yet‚Ä¶ such an important story to me and means soo much to my world. I think we‚Äôre all in for a good surprise I‚Äôm gonna be hopeful!! Pedro sounds amazing as Joel‚Ä¶ just everything so far I‚Äôm
So excited"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I'm so excited to see Ellie vs David. That was such a big part for me because it showed how Joel was Ellie's safe place. I just hope the actors don't bomb this üò≠
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Knowing it's coming from the guys who made the Chernobyl mini-series, I have good faith, Pedro Pascal is phenomenal. The bad thing is how many times this show will make me cry if done properly. TLOU was one of the first games that I really got connected to, one of the best games of all time IMO. Lets not mess it up!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"She might not look like Ellie, but I‚Äôll be damned if she doesn‚Äôt feel like Ellie. Really inspired casting decision."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Knowing it's coming from the guys who made the Chernobyl mini-series, I have good faith, Pedro Pascal is phenomenal. The bad thing is how many times this show will make me cry if done properly. TLOU was one of the first games that I really got connected to, one of the best games of all time IMO. Lets not mess it up!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,With the storyline they‚Äôre working with this has the potential of being one of the best zombie series ever‚Ä¶.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Was anyone one else choking back tears when Take Me On started playing in the backround? Looks amazing and true to the game, unlike most video game adaptations. I've shown this to a couple people who roll their eyes when I try to describe how great the stories in video games have become and they admit that this does looks impressive. Plus, it's HBO. It is known to have the most acclaimed shows for decades. Six Feet Under, Carnivale, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, Westworld, ect. So excited."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"‚ÄúYou may not be her father, but you were someone‚Äôs.‚Äù Damn Henry never said that in the game and that‚Äôs a great line. I can‚Äôt wait to see some original writing for this new show that mixes with the game writing and the fact that they have Neil Druckman helping is how you know it won‚Äôt disappoint."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When I first played Last of Us, I fell in love with it. This was everything you wanted in a game, so much so that I watched the cinematics as much as I played the game. Two people struggling in a vicious world that threatened to end their lives at any given moment.
This could be one of the biggest things to happen to a tv series. I just pray that they direct it properly."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This show looks like it has great potential to be astoundingly amazing. That rendition of ""Take On Me"" was beautifully haunting and gave me goose bumps. I am very excited for this to say the least.

That being said, I think the success of the show will depend largely on how well Pedro and Bella can nail the complex, evolving chemistry of Joel and Ellie's relationship. I think Pedro is a perfect fit for the role. However, and this may be an unpopular opinion, I have some reservations about Bella as Ellie. My first impression is that she seems to lack the ""pizzazz"" and quirkiness of Ellie as depicted in the video game. Nonetheless, I do remain cautiously optimistic that she will pull it off somehow. Fingers crossed."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I love that they seem to have kept the core of the plot (which is important!) while also adding more personalized human encounters. Kind of like more in-between during the journey we experienced in the game. As long as it makes sense and still goes its proper course, creative liberties is fine. Mostly because the story is about humans surviving. So adding characters that don't take away from the main plot point and Journey is fine."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,A lot of gamers are going to watch this and we will be completely honest about the series. So far it looks legit.  Top five game of all time.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I hope this will make people realize what an experience and how generation defining the game was. I hope this game makes people respect videogames as art and recognize that some games have better stories than movies. This is one of them.


Thank you everyone at Naughty Dog ."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,All it's going to take is for one show to totally nail a game adaptation and the flood gates are going to open.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I think it‚Äôs incredibly interesting that we‚Äôve slowing started to adopt a lower standard of filmmaking as the new normal. Like this show might very well be quite good. And the cast looks amazing. So why am I not blown away by atmosphere and tension? Because they‚Äôre forgetting how to do that. The games were incredibly atmospheric with a real sense of the world. Now, much like with The Rings Of Power, we have a premium high end TV show that looks like the a mid budget network show with commercials. And that‚Äôs what they want us to pay 15 bucks a months for. And I wanna make it clear that it‚Äôs not just the studios/streamers. This is just as much the filmmakers fault for not trying anymore. Beautifully crafted stories through motion are still possible, you just have to be able to see why it‚Äôs important to put in the work."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I‚Äôm extremely curious what they do with this. Most of us interested in the show know how both games end so will they flip the script and go down a different route or stay true to the games? Based on the trailer it seems they‚Äôll be following the games but how closely will they follow them? Either way they‚Äôre going to be under careful watch because this is not the title to mess around with, everyone will be expecting a top tier show because of how spectacular the games were."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This looks amazing, and the fact that they are changing stuff and making it unique and different from the game is FANTASTIC"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,If they keep the father daughter relationship Joel and Ellie has this show will be absolutely amazing
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Most of us already know how this story ends, so it's gonna be up to this two actors and their chemistry to make us care for them like it's our first time experiencing this journey."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"If Joel and Ellie have the right dynamic as they did in the game, this will be epic."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Most of us already know how this story ends, so it's gonna be up to this two actors and their chemistry to make us care for them like it's our first time experiencing this journey."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,As Gamers we already know the story‚Ä¶ we just want to feel it. I hope the actors make us feel the chemistry better Joel and Ellie. I am so excited.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Okay, I played this game multiple times. And while I don't have huge expectations when this was announced a few years ago, this trailer changed things. Casting aside, they got the atmosphere right, because this trailer gave me goosebump, and I hope it translates to the whole series."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"They better get it right. If so, the masses will be able to experience one of the best narrative stories ever told. The Last Of Us was a masterpiece. PLEASE GET THIS RIGHT!!!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This looks amazing, and the fact that they are changing stuff and making it unique and different from the game is FANTASTIC"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Man I remember when I waited almost 2 years for the last of us to come out on PS3 ‚Ä¶ probably one of the best games so far in this century‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt get into gaming anymore but will definitely watch this series.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"The trailer have so much potential. My gosh, seeing Joel again, even that glimpse of him punching someone to the ground. Goosebumps. Seriously, I have high hopes!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"if the first 10 min start just like the game, I am going to be bawling. That opening scene got me everytime."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"They did well handing Ellie‚Äôs role to Bella Ramsey, fell in love with her acting since got"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"""When you have played the best game 
You expect the best series""

Don't let us down üôè"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,The Last of Us was the best storymode based game I've ever played in my life. I hope this series reflects the video game well.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Pedro Pascal has a talent playing characters with tough exteriors who are trying to transport children across long distances slowly starting to love that child like his own despite seeing them merely as cargo at the beginning of the journey.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I'm getting such goosebumps watching this!!! My favorite game, looks like you really did it justice, thank you!!!
<3"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I was worried this would be ruined, but then I see this trailer üòîüòêüôÇüòÉüòçü•∞ I'm all in!!!!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This looks amazing, and the fact that they are changing stuff and making it unique and different from the game is FANTASTIC"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Looks great! Definitely glad to see ‚ÄúLeft Behind‚Äù DLC story is being mixed in as well.

And so long as y‚Äôall NEVER do TLOU2 (unless there is HEAVY rewriting of the story involved), this will be quite the TV series."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Seeing the two brothers that Joel and ellie meet broke my heart, I'm not ready for that again"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Totally different reaction I get from this traitor vs uncharted. Both games are perfection. I felt nothing for uncharted sadly but this gave me chills. I am going have to replay bf seeing this. So far hitting all the right notes
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I have played TLOU Remastered on PS4 multiple playthroughs and when I saw this trailer out of the blue I got excited. The storyline and gameplay itself was beautiful. I dont remember what got me into playing TLOU at first but man I do not regret it.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I got chills on how accurate some of the locations were compared to the game, especially from when ""Take On Me"" started playing. I actually shed a tear haha. Really looking forward to this show"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,It‚Äôs Joel‚Äôs fate to die. It‚Äôs going to happen sooner or later. I know everyone out there hate The Last of Us Part ll. I love the casting. This is going to be my younger brother‚Äôs first time watching Bella Ramsey on our favorite series. He has not watched ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù. He wants to see how Bella Ramsey act and he only knows about Pedro Pascal‚Äôs acting because he probably saw him ‚ÄúMandalorian‚Äù.  I did told him about Bella Ramsey‚Äôs acting on ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù is really good.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I am so excited for this. So far it looks and seems like the game, hopefully they have the same chemistry as in the game as well!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Damn I'm so hyped for this. Hope this is as good as the game if someone hasn't played the game i will highly recommend playing it it's in my top 5 games of all time.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I dreamed of this, when I finished the game. I finished the game, a week after release.
It was the best.... Game... I've ever played. Story wise."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This is absolutely unreal. Can't wait for this show to come out. Ashley as Ellie's mom, Troy as one of David's men is perfect."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I love the fact that the trailers have songs that were featured in the games. A previous trailer had the song playing in the car Joel gets from Bill's town, and this obviously has Take On Me."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I haven't had HBO Max for a while, but this is something that I've wanting for a long time  I'm sure they won't disappoint. Can't wait ü§òüòéüî•üî•"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks sooooooo good. Great casting by the look of the trailer. I can't wait!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This show hinges on the bond between Joel and Ellie. I hope they‚Äôve nailed it üôèüèº
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I hope people don't write this off as ""just another apocalypse show"" because the Last of Us really is one of the best stories told in a game, that I've encountered. If they stick as closely as possible to the source material, this is going to be special."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I am so pumped for this. My dad and I absolutely love The Last of Us!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Won't lie. 1:25 sent shivers down my spine. Actually really looking forward to this!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This trailer gave me goosebumps. Especially the ""Take On Me"" part!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I can't wait!!! I've been eager to watch this series since the rumours came out they were making a series. It looks amazing and faithful to the game! The visuals are are also spectacular and the atmosphere of the game is there, I'm loving this so far!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I hope this series can bring us to the character, especially Joel. When I played that game, I'm so into it and got the feeling to that character. To protect the one you care."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Can't wait. As long as they keep it true to the game, script and all, it should be fantastic."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I can't say how much I loved the games. And I cant wait to watch this.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When the video game first came out, and I thought about what it would be like if a movie for this was made, I thought of Joe Manganiello. Mostly because he naturally has that rugged look. It will be interesting to see what Pedro Pascale brings to the role. I have loved every film I have seen this man in so far."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Looks like they're staying true to the game! Can't freaking wait!!!!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I can‚Äôt even describe how excited I am for this, I hope they got the relationship between Joel and Ellie right, like in the game. If so this show will be incredible!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,That shot at 0:56 üòçüòç I'm SO EXCITED FOR THIS!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I can't get this trailer out of my head just eagerly waiting for jan 15
1,uLtkt8BonwM,it's not about the ending it's about the journey. Thoroughly looking forward to it.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This game made me feel things i didn't know i was capable of feeling.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"If they get Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship right, the show will be a huge success"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"At first I was like ""why should i care about something like this that I personally experienced through gameplay"". Then I saw the cast, the themes, the visuals, the everything. I just hope they deliver cause this franchise is beloved by almost everyone I know. If they can do this right then for those who never experienced the first game is in for a real treat."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Never played the game, and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs about or how it ends or anything. But this looks great!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Slightly scared because shows like this don't always come out well but im willing to watch it because I love the game and it genuinely looks good.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks amazing I can't wait for this to come out watching it day one ü•≥
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks incredible! I love how they have so much respect for the property they put the dude who made Chernobyl on to direct it. And that show is probably the most terrifying thing to ever exist.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I will never be able to get over how perfect Joel looks but how different Ellie looks
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I love this game so much. I hope they don't ruin this!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"So hyped for this. I know it's unlikely but I hope for the future seasons that alycia debnam Carey will play adult Ellie, she'd be perfect"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Nick Offerman. Is. The. Perfect. Cast. For. Bill. I cannot believe how they absolutely NAILED the cast, and the overall feel of the game. I am so pleasantly shocked."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This would definitely be on my watch list if germany had HBO.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"For the ones who have played the game, let‚Äôs not start comparing the series with the game. It won‚Äôt be exact and there will be some alterations for cinematic purposes. As long as they get the storyline straight while building on the relationships it will be great."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This is absolutely unreal. Can't wait for this show to come out. Ashley as Ellie's mom, Troy as one of David's men is perfect."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When Henry said ‚ÄúYou may not be her father, but your someone‚Äôs.‚Äù üò¢ I‚Äôm not emotionally prepared for the Henry and Sam story arc."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This was already a great story within a game. All HBO needs to do is to not follow the woke philosophy of Netflix, Prime, Disney etc. and simply tell a good story. Also, they should avoid any story elements from the utterly wretched Part II"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"10 years man....
My heart, my soul
Thank you so much for this amazing masterpiece 
I truly cannot wait!!üíôüíôüíô"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Demasiadas emociones me transmite este trailer
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"After I played the first game I said it needed to be made into a movie. Nearly 10 years later, after all the talk of movies/making a series were finally getting it. Feels like a dream come true. I hope it lives up to the game because it was the best game I have ever played"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,The feel is definitely right. Hope the series gets it right too!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Looks very promising, will be amazing if they do it nearly as good as the game did. My only wish is that they don't adapt the second part and just give us closure after the first one (either that or change the second part drastically)."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"The show we all desperately desire, but will it be done right to be the show we definitely deserve?"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Looks really good I hope I lives up to the game one of the best games I've ever played

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the theatre in 1981 with my best friend from school. We were so stoked afterward we asked the ticket taker if we could stay for the next showing and he let us without charge. We called our moms from the payphone outside and asked if we could see the show again. They though we were nuts but said yes. We kinda thought it was silly too, but the decades have proven we may not have been so dumb after all."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where Indy is riding on a horse and he screams ""... they may take our lives but they will never take OUR FREEDOM!"" That was life changing for me."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When Indy said, ""I am vengeance, I am the knight, I am Batman."" Truly wonderful story telling"

EDIT: as in the film‚Äôs primary artefact; I‚Äôm aware of his success with the Cross Of Coronado"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Anton turned to Indy and asked ""What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss"" had me convulsing on the floor! Truly a masterpiece!"

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Literally gave me chill when indy said ‚Äúwe are the Indiana Joneses‚Äù
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where he said ""I gotta bad feeling about this.."""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I still cannot believe that this is going to be John Williams's final movie score, he is the main reason why I love music in the first place. He is a literal legend of music, the literal equivalent to the likes of Beethoven and others."

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"""I don't believe in magic"", says the character who literally saw the Holy Grail disintegrate one of his enemies and heal his mortally wounded father in front of his very eyes. I think it safe to say, that in this universe magic is a real thing."

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,My dad took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark in the theaters when I was 9 years old.  Indiana Jones has been a part of my life for 40 years.

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,The part where Indy falls down and breaks a hip is truly heartbreaking.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Indiana Jones is the reason for my obsession with learning different languages. Can you imagine how much more difficult his adventures would have been if he didn't speak the language of the part of the world he was in? Even at the age of six, I realized how useful such a skill can be. These movies changed me forever."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where he says ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Made me wet my pants... Truly amazing."

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,That scene where Indy joins an Indie band gave me goosebumps

Hope this blows up.... 

I appreciate the amount of work 
It literally takes me a while for a 30 sec edit. 

Never in my life did I see some one with the amount of patience she has. She also works a lot on making you have that weird feeling of being very happy for them Idk how to describe it but... Like it's getting very exciting everytime they are around /close from each other
Great job siv!"
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,I really feel like crying rn bc all of the GCMs you make are always made from the heart. We always get attached to these characters and they are just gonna be the perfect match for each other. These ships must sailllll!! ‚õµÔ∏è
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"I just love how in all of these mini movies theres always a theme with the 2 protagonists. The male always denies his feeling and portrays the female as irrelevant, just a toy, a dumb little imbecile, but then closer to the end he becomes obsessed and wants to cherish the female forever and never let her go by always chasing her, following her around, complimenting her, ect. But the female very slowly warms up to him and we only see her love and affection towards the very end. Correct me if I'm wrong on some of these things. I really love how everything is portrayed and it's very creative and you are by far my favorite gachatuber and possibly my favorite youtuber of all. Every single time you post I get excited and just generally happy. I thank you for being a source of my happiness ‚ù§"
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"i watched thru the whole 1 hour on a school night and i say it was fully worth the hours of sleep i will not be getting, it almost made me cry (just like all your other gacha movies) i talk to my friends on how i recommend you and your stories because of how much i enjoy them each time, i honestly get so excited when i see you post and watch the whole entire thing. u make me feel stuff and i can tell how much effort and emotion you put into each one of these, i cant wait to watch your next masterpiece! -Emmie (you dont know me lol)"

1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"This gcmm cannot me described in words. Its TOO good to be true. You literally deserve an oscar! You put so much effort into the tweening, the drawing, the poses, the hand placements and the storyline is just perfection. I have nothing to say exept this is PERFECT and im sorry i cant say anything else because im stunned, how much a 16year old can do. I cant even imagine being in 10th or 11th grade, about to graduate with so many responsabilities and homework and still putting my heart and soul into gcmms to entertain people. Mindblowing. Just mindblowing.

Anyways, thank you for taking time to read this Siv and just to let you know, you arent like any other 16 yo, you are special and thats what makes you my idol. I hope you, your relatives and friends are doing great and keep going, i belive you will grow big one day!

1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"Honestly, tomorrow is the day I confront my fake friends and I was feeling so stressed thinking of what to say because everyone's been misunderstanding me and the biggest one was emotionally harassing me for telling my parents. And just as my mind started to go blank and cause me a headache, I saw this. I clicked on it to see it thinking ""I've been waiting for the last part for so long. Let's watch it I guess"" and I'm so happy I clicked. This was actually quite comforting to watch because of the smoothness and everything. Make me change my mind if you can (‡©≠ÀôÍí≥‚ÄãÀô)‡©≠"
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"This was so exciting and enjoying to watch! There is no time where me and my bestie watched this without squealing from those romantic scenes of Sarina and Zan and we also cried from scenes that are heartbreaking, i was so impressed that you can put emotions to people just by creating such a masterpiece and thats the reason why i loved your channel and had been subscribed for uhm 1 year?

1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS MASTERPIECE!
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"A serious round of applause for this. I usually don't comment on gacha life/club movies or animations but this video and even your whole channel has been so good that it's compelled me to. I just finished watching this in school and i would rather run the risk of someone catching me watching gacha then not watch it üòÇ. Thank you, seriously thank you for making this masterpiece."
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"this is a masterpiece . are u kidding me bro - ‚Ä¶. your drawing, the speech, the action and all is so perfect . this deservers a lot of views and likes ‚Ä¶ I m so impressed with these qualities and so far this is the best movie i watched in my life time"
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"Daily reminder: You're not useless. You're not a dissapointment. You're not dumb. You're not different. You're not compared to anyone. Because... You're loved. You're strong. You're smart. You're beautiful inside and out. You're the best version of YOU there ever is. and you're human. I know you're going through a lot of stuff right now but it'll be okay.

1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,Sometimes I actually forget these GCM‚Äôs are made with Gacha Club because they are so detailed and well-animated. Siv is by far the best Gachatuber ever (in my opinion). All of these movies are just too amazing. Words can‚Äôt describe how absolutely wonderful these are. This one was my favorite! ü§ç

And even though i hate waiting for things i really dont mind waiting months for you to post because i KNOW you are developing a beauty. Please keep on moving forward :)"
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,I've watched almost all of your gcmm's and they are all really good and I hope your doing well and getting enough sleep and not pushing your self to hard to please other ppl.
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE!!!!
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"It's great about your stories that the story and the characters are different, and this is something amazing that I don't always see, but don't you see that some events are repeated?  Don't you get tired of the same repetitive theme?  I don't mean to change the genre of the story.  What I mean is trying to create a different story.  It is true that the meaning of the story is love, but make it in a different way, I mean in a more interesting way!  I really can't believe if your drawing is infused with different interesting ideas it will be something unpredictable!  And I guarantee that if you do this, many followers will like it!  I hope you understand what I mean ‚ù§Ô∏è.  Good luck."
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,I absolutely love this series and I was so excited when I saw this and thank you so much for putting so much effort into this it‚Äôs amazing!
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,i‚Äôve watched it once and i wanna watch it again. I love your videos and you work extremely hard on them! I‚Äôve never seen such great editing and drawing. You deserve 1m subscribers! I wanted you to know how much i loved this.
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,I've been wanting to find a gcm like this I haven't already watched and never could and now I'm satisfied üòç
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"You have put more than half of the Gacha content creators to shame. I love it! The creativity that you exude baffles me beyond belief. I saw my notification this morning, sent it to my friend to pioneer it before I check it out. Her only comment back to me after doing so was, ""you should be my second pairs of eyes"". I knew right there and then that I had to get mentally prepared for one of the best Movies I could watch in my current lifetime. I was right. Just seeing the character references and the cross as symbolism. As a fellow artist I can only wonder how you found yourself drawn to Gacha and the cause that influenced you to become an influencer of this caliber. At times like thease do I strongly question if the world is truly equal. People wouldn't think to do something until one proves that it's possible. The story you made today filled a lot of people's hearts that felt that most story's with a similar idea missed or glossed over. Thank you! Please, please, please take your rest. You've done more than enough. To anyone else who managed to read up this point (highly doubt that) or just wanted to scroll down to the bottom to save time.

Subscribe & put a Like and hopefully comment your thanks aswell.

Sorry for being late to comment. I only wish others would learn from this and not try to make copies that only gloss over the important details. 

Thank you for being original! (Personal quote): mistakes make you human so don't fear them.  Now enough of me."

Thank you for this masterpiece siv ing."
1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,This vid is one of the creative and amazing vid I have ever watched! Everything about it amaze me. While watching the video I cried a few and had a lot of words in my mind that I wished to tell you but it was too much I didn't know where to start and forgot when I goed to the comment section. üôÅ

1,ZFfbkg2lYQ4,"damn it, it would be interesting to see the turn of events: the last (essentially 1 Sarena) turned out to be imprisoned, but then Zan found that second Serena, and suddenly ‚Äúbang‚Äù the past Sarina gets out of the darkness, and sees that the second Serena is with Zan  .  It would be cool to see such a turn of events) After all, what would Zan do then?  He loves them both.."

1,fwkAPU856B4,"This video took SO LONG to make. From solving the Clay Hill problem that the Wakey Wakey version of the series and the GPS created, to making a full and complete timeline, to doing a collab with Film Theory, this was one UNIT of a series. If you would consider liking the video and subscribing to the channel, that would be MOST appreciated make it worth it to spend so much time and energy into these videos!

Let me know if you want to see one final Don't Hug Me I'm Scared Season 1 Theory, and if so, let me know what question(s) you would like me to answer! If you have any other theory ideas, want to clarify mine, or have some more evidence to support the theory, comment them down below!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,Matpat and REM Games go together like fluffer and nutter
1,fwkAPU856B4,I love how Mattpat posted his video 5 mins after this one
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Don't think I need to explain how I ""suddenly"" found this channel
Get ready for a ground swell, the theorists are coming"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Does anyone else remember when duck told Red guy that ""the people are dying to know what your third guess would have been"" and Yellow guy said ""what people?"" that always struck me as weird"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Sooo glad you and matpat got in contact, been watching your theories since you started posting them and was worried matpat would release one that would completely overshadow your hard work, I hope you get the recognition you deserve from that Collab :):))

Have a good day!!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,Fun Fact: This video and his collaboration with film theory are both 18:01 minutes.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"So happy you got the attention of MatPat! These theories are amazing and I‚Äôm so glad that they got the attention the deserve. This fluffer-nutter is very happy!

(Ignore the fluffer-nutter bit, MatPat told me to!)"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"this is really random to put on the last episode of a theory series, but i just finished watching yours and matpat's videos, and i have a theory. you and matpat went over how ""duck got it right"" in the first episode, however i think he actually didn't. what i think happened is that he got yellow guy's part right, and got a coin for that, which explains why the coffin thinks that yellow guy is dead, but it is actually duck. this is also backed up by the fact that the whole 'david' thing happened to lesley, not the creators/actors, so they wouldn't know which one represented him. totally a long shot but i just thought i'd put it somewhere! also your series is really good and i hope you get even more attention now that you are in a film theory video!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,I hope you make more theories if season two comes out.
1,fwkAPU856B4,I am so glad that this series happened. This is hands down the best DHMIS theory I've ever seen. Thank you for putting in all this work to try and solve this series.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I‚Äôd like to see a video about how the teachers relate to the lore and how they were designed because in Yellow Guy‚Äôs memory, I saw 2 kids that looked like Lily and Todney."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I never understood why yellow guy threw away his FLUFFER-NUTTER.
It looked good."
1,fwkAPU856B4,Congrats on the Collab RemGames! So happy to see you reaching a bigger audience (fluffernutter or whatever)
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I find it hella weird that 5 mins after RemGames uploads their dhmis video, FilmTheory (Matpat) uploads their dhmis video too??? Could just be a coincidence, but to me it doesn't feel like it

EDIT: THEY DID A COLLAB TOGETHER HOLY HECK!!!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I can‚Äôt help but wonder if maybe the teachers are trapped too. Lamp said that maybe people could come back as their favorite animal or object so maybe the teachers are other people that died now acting as an object? It‚Äôs also worth noting that it‚Äôs inconsistent how much the teachers are working with the council, since Sketchbook, Colin, Choo Choo, and Electracey all seem to never try to do anything to harm the main ones. I also have to wonder, why did Lamp tell Yellow Guy all the stuff about the council?"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I agree with most of this, however there's one thing that doesn't sit quite right with me. That would be red guy's place in all this. Out of the main three, we know the least about his ""death"". Then it hit me, what if red guy technically isn't really dead like the other two? Remember how in the original youtube series, it was theorized that red guy was the creative head until Roy took over? What if that applies here too? What if red guy willingly became a part of this whole show because he was desperate for his dream tv show to become reality and is now paying the price for making a deal with Roy? Rather than being dead, red guy sold his soul to Roy back in the original youtube series, thus he is in a state of limbo. 
For starters, this could explain why he's desperate to escape this world within the tv show. As he has no say in this show whatsoever, instead being subjected to whatever warped lessons the higher ups have to brainwash him with. Another big piece of evidence is the idea that the puppets are supposed to represent the dead, yet red guy is the only one who's played by an actual human. Maybe this could indicate that he actually never died, and he sold his soul on the same day that yellow guy and duck died like yellow guy said. 
In conclusion, I think that this whole show was originally made by red guy in pursuit of his dreams, but Roy, Leslie, and whoever else is part of the higher ups have twisted and sabotaged it to suit their own agenda. While this is happening, red guy has no choice in the matter but to play along as an actor in this tv show. Hence, why he lives in an actual nightmare."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"i‚Äôm unsure of whether or not you‚Äôre familiar with the work of don hertzfeldt, but episodes one, two, and three of ‚Äúworld of tomorrow‚Äù REALLY need an analysis + timeline/breakdown. i think you‚Äôd be perfect!! his other work is also *very* much worth talking about, and i think your channel would really help with more exposure"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Finally! I've been waiting for this one, I can't wait to enjoy it. Congrats on getting so far with this series."
1,fwkAPU856B4,0:04 Me when my therapist asks if I have any unhealthy obsessions
1,fwkAPU856B4,I thought it was weird that you and MatPat posted at the same time so I clicked on this video first and then the comments said you and MatPat collabed for his video! That‚Äôs so awesome! Your DHMIS videos have been amazing so I‚Äôm glad that you are getting more recognition!
1,fwkAPU856B4,Nice Theory! After watching it I still have a question of how the Fluffer-Nutter plays into this. Always thought it was a bit odd that they just brought it up and then stopped talking about it. Maybe you can do a video on it in the future
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I think ‚ÄúBad Things That Could Happen‚Äù is also part of this theory. Lesley‚Äôs first model of this world is without characters at all, but still teaches morals, just unclear. If that makes sense."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Ahh this is amazing, you really deserve the recognition! Been following your DHMIS stuff from the beginning, absolutely solid work!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,Thanks Mat for introducing us to another great creator!
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Though, not to likely, but if Yellow Guy was smart at the start of TV series, maybe...
1. He could have already foumd out that Lesley seemed way to trusting, and lilke how she keep ""backups"". Yellow Guy could have had time to make other sheets and produces that he imported around different locations.
2. Also the WakeyWakey series bwing deleted could also servo of purpose. Like if in a future episode a teacher helps the gang about the earth through timd or types of areas. Duck could stumble upon a previous loop of him being mayor there, and maybe find more symbols Yellow Guy left behind.
3.We could even shuffle through alternate events like if Duck ripped the book(he was trying to grab Yellow's guy batteries). Or if Red Guy saved Duck from the grave."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"i appreciated this so much, i‚Äôve been along for the ride the whole time and in my insomniac driven rampage you‚Äôve helped with a hyper obsession of mine, i‚Äôm glad to say that despite your small following you may be one of the most deserving content creators on this platform, i appreciate everything you‚Äôve done and i can confidently say i will be watching any videos that come around. if you truly want a challenge have you ever considered looking into the binding of isaac (the game) and it‚Äôs dlc add ons 
it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs so lore worthy and as many times as i‚Äôve seen it covered it never truly feels complete, i believe this could be a fun and genuinely challenging theory that i believe the community would be more than happy to help with!! if not i‚Äôll continue to support any new theories with joy, sincerely some random 17 year old on the internet :)"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Just finished watching the film theory video and I gotta say. Well done dude, I love your and matpats theories so this was a treat. You absolutely deserve it. Can't wait to see future theories! (;"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Now you're at almost 38k!! Congratulations, this is a true testament to your hard work & high-quality video creation. It would be awesome to see you looking back into the original youtube series, and dissecting that. Doubt you'll see this comment, but if you do, please keep up the amazing DHMIS content. In whatever realm or context that may be! And brilliant job on a concise, sensible, palatable & enjoyable 6-part series. It's not easy to engage people across 6 relatively long form content videos, so well done on succeeding on such a high level. :)"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"It would also make sense for Clayhill to come before the YouTube series in a different sense. If the Council gives the actors money for working properly as big companies do, they probably lost a lot of money in Wakey Wakey since, as far as we know, everything in there happened properly. And since they would‚Äôve lost money because of the timeline‚Äôs eventual reset, that MIGHT be why the YT series is much lower quality than Clayhill despite it coming before.
Typing and reading this sounds really dumb thinking about it."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I actually git a question and is that we already know that ""Wakey Wakey"" actually happens the same day as the YouTube series because you can see the calendar in an official image of the pilot so... does that affects the timeline?"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Wait, what if Red Guy's and Duck's items are not what they need, but a representation of that? Thinking about it, Red Guy's item is a shovel, which may represent that he needs to die, but he ""doesn't die for ages"", with the closest he's been to death at the ending of episode 2, when they start fighting and the credits appear, with the episode ending right during the sound of chainsaw and Red Guy Screaming, as if someone stopped the episode before his death (also, he questions why he isn't dead in episode 1 and 2). And there is duck's item, the chips bag, which could represent food. Duck is the only character that is constantly being denied food, (the vending machine from episode 1, the chips bag not opening for him and only having 2 chips inside (one for Yellow Guy and one for Red Guy, with the episode ending before he reaches the food), him dying from dehydration, and other moments where the scene changes before he eats, such as the living slice of bread he puts in the toaster before the show skips to him singing somewhere else. So maybe that's what needs to happen, Yellow Guy gets his batteries, Duck eats and Red Guy dies."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I love your theorizing, even though I don't agree with all of it, I still appreciate the mind at work.  Love it!  Good job!  <3  But I just have one big question: Why is the latest DHMIS obsessed with *chiptune* iconography?  Sawtooth, triangle, and sine-waves; clef, neutral, and note symbols.  The shredded book is clearly tying the character symbols/names to musical instructions that apply specifically to the three main characters making chiptunes.  I suspect the big sciencey blackboard also relates to music, in spite of it looking like some kind of space/time mad scientist work.  Something which all weirdly does NOT apply to Lesley, the music avatar of this show?  It is ... weird.  And I can't find any other theorist commenting on this in spite of it being so hard to unsee once you notice it.  It's saying ... s o m e t h i n g ... but I'm having problems figuring what chiptunes have to do with a n y t h i n g in the DMHIS story.  Not just music in general, but chiptunes specifically, is just so ... unexpectedly unusual.  It's got to mean ... something.  Right?  I'd love to see you and friends do another MatPat collab to bring great theorist minds together to chew on this one.  The more the merrier ... the chiptune.  LOL  (Such an oddly specific thing way out of most people's wheelhouse!)"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Absolutely solid work! I don't think I couldn't have been able to do this any better myself. I do have one question, someone had already asked this but what do you think about us the audience being the council? Sometimes the characters very loosely seem to be aware they are in a show. Like in the family episode when Duck tells Red Guy ""people are dying to know you're 3rd would've been"" and Red Guy just responds with ""what people?"" And if they're living their life as a performance for the council, we are the ones who watch this performance. I dunno tho, what do you think?"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"When watching Matpat's newest video for DHMIS, seeing him talk about the codes I genuinely thought ""RemGames would love this theory!"" and then you're actually in the video!! Was amazing!! Congrats for being in the video!:D"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"fun fact: Lesley has key on one of her sleeves, and it looks exactly like the key that served as the teacher in the pilot. also, from the clips i‚Äôve seen of the pilot (some people uploaded recordings) yellow guy never wears a party hat."
1,fwkAPU856B4,Such a flutter-nutter theory! Been watching Matpat for years so I'm always happy to find new smart people who make interesting theories :)
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Would've been cool to see the Kickstarter series included in the timeline. Probably could fit after the YouTube series, with the original puppets being held for ransom being what made Leslie mad enough to start plotting an escape with Yellow Guy"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"There is one other time that yellow guy wears a party hat, his retirement party in episode one of the show. But seeing as how this is seemingly one of the ""incorrect"" versions of the loop and the fact that yellow guy is young in the photo on the fridge, I don't see the retirement party really meaning anything but I'm not sure"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Red guy only wears his scarf once, but it travels through every episode.it means something."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"pretty cool theory. My question is, what about the red guy symbol that is seen in the family boardgame layout and I think on some of the patches in the picture frames? I don't know, doesn't really align with the theory of it being his symbol, idk. But maybe it's about things that red should do according to the council to earn a pound and things just didn't turn out that way. Loved your collab with matpat by the way. Was it hard to condense all your theories into the short format of just 18 minutes (less probably, with intro and outro in mind)?  Lovely work on this whole theorising!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I feel like it's possible that the next season will be the same events, in the same order, but slightly different. With say, red guy dying, correctly utilizing the shovel, and getting his pound, as they try to get closer to the correct performance.  With more 'meta' lore developments with Leslie and the council along the way.  I mean, with the theme of repetition it makes the most sense in my mind, and I'm sure creatively they'd be able to pull that idea off in New, creative, and funny ways to make it all still fresh and interesting"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I have a feeling that duck had his awakening first and realized the higher depth of everything and how he could profit and wut not so he joined the council but is ‚Äúapart‚Äù of the show to keep things moving the way they r supposed to, and that‚Äôs why he usually gets what he wants and doesn‚Äôt have to do much of anything, and he messes things up in an ignorant way but he really knows exactly what he‚Äôs doin, and that‚Äôs also why clay hill was ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù but idk, it jus feels like he‚Äôs not really apart of the rest of them, like he‚Äôs tryna hold ‚Äòem back on purpose, he literally decided he didn‚Äôt wanna b dead anymore and came back"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Gah, I'm late to the party by 12 hours but I'm so happy for you Remy! I was hoping MatPat would mention your theories and I was so excited to see he'd actually brought you on! Love the videos and hope you get a big boost from his fans finding out you're here! Oh right and don't forget to eat your fluffer nutters, y'all."
1,fwkAPU856B4,Your killing it man. You had one of the first dhmis theory videos when the show released and its impressive you had all the videos laid out so theyd be exactly 6 videos
1,fwkAPU856B4,"THANK YOU for an absolutely amazing 6 episodes on dhmis, this is seriously my favourite theory series for being so engaging, interesting, well-edited and just so so fun! I'm so glad I was able to find your channel thanks to these, so I can't wait to see what you do next!‚ù§"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"If wakey wakey was supposed to take place before the YouTube series in the timeline. Clay Hill should be their actual home and not the dollhouse.
In the YouTube series, we see a poster, saying they've been missing since the 19th.
We can then assume this is the Clay Hill residents looking for them after they've been abducted by the dollhouse.
We only see the poster outside of the dollhouse.
So we can assume, they lived in Clay Hill until the 18. Then disappeared. The residents of Clay Hill started putting up posters and looking for them on the 19th. Before the powers that be, made the entire town dissappear by the 20th."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"What if Red Guy drove himself into the lake when everything happened with duck and yellow guy? I know it says ""at the same time"" but I don't think it means to be so literal about that. Remember, he was in a panic to get out of the house and go anywhere else and bringing two people along that couldn't be there, then picking Roy who may have been dead or alive but was still part of the mental family he has. just a thought"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"You know, I just watched Matpats new theory and first, congrats on being in it! And second, this theory is absolutely GENIUS"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"As a question, if they were to add a fourth character to the show, how do you think they'd be able to do it, as they do love plot twists, might be a good one"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Dude, they should actually get you in the Game Theorists team, you're amazing at telling theories
Also just want to put this detail in; Duck is seen using a driller in the photo on the fridge and he had ""safety"" robots in every citizen's house who had drills in some part of Wakey Wakey"
1,fwkAPU856B4,The moment I finished Film Theory's video I started watching your series about dhmis and now I finished it all. I just cant wait to see your other content! Im so amazed by how incredibly smart theorists can be and am so grateful that matpat showed me your channel cuz I never subscribed quicker
1,fwkAPU856B4,Visiting from MatPat!! You can see all the work you put in in your lore research and videos!! You‚Äôve got a new subscriber in me!
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I have absolutely 100% loved your six part series here. I don't know what you would add in any final bonus episode, but I am so hungry for more, I'll add my two cents in asking for it.

On another note, your ""thank you""s at the end of your videos have been so heart felt. It reminded me of a small restaurant owner that gave a heart felt thank you to each customer which made me appreciate him so much more and wish for his growth and success. I wish the same for you."
1,fwkAPU856B4,You‚Äôre dhmis theory is amazing and you are one of the most talented theorists I know! See you in your next work of art fluffer-nutter
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Hey i just want to add, when you mentioned Yellow Guy's birthday, at the end of the computer episode in the original web series, the text to speech voice says ""you weren't invited to the party"". it's always bothered me and i hope this helps with anything, maybe a correlation between the two perhaps? though i love your content, i love your theories and I watched the one on Matt's channel right before this one since i have the bell on for your channel! Weirdly, you're the only channel i actually have the bell for LOL...congrats on that! But yeah in the original show, there was no mention of any kind of party either except in the fourth wall break just before Red's head explodes...i dunno if it might have mentioned the picnic in the love episode or not.,.since a picnic isn't a party in my opinion."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"i remember how you told me that there was a suprise, on your community post, i did not expect it to be a collab with MatPat!! either way, im glad i got to see my 2 theory people working together!!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,Absolutely loved this series man! Your collab with Matt was incredible. I'm really excited for season 2.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"This is so good, and such a satisfying timeline. Well done!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"ET isn't a prop. He's a character. He wasn't ""reused,"" there were several characters there of the species.

And if Star Wars is a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, that makes all of Star Wars a prequel to ET. The species is in there because Spielberg and Lucas are friends."
1,fwkAPU856B4,Thank you so much for this series.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"You're humble, efficient, and to-the-point. Quality work, please make more speculation videos on other shows or book series as well."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"A tiny theory,
The reason why duck remember the clay turns into him even tho the old duck died was because every time when the character got replaced it will slowly get their personality back and a few memories they remembered in the past"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I‚Äôve been watching this channel and the DHMIS theories here for a bit, but it is fluffer-nutting exciting to see some big and small creators collaborate"
1,fwkAPU856B4,You did an amazing job on discussing the new dhmis series but I have two questions‚Ä¶.question one is what‚Äôs up with roy controlling the machine to summon the teachers in episode 6 of the YouTube series and two‚Ä¶why do they turn into their favorite colors at the end of the YouTube series and never again‚Ä¶.it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me
1,fwkAPU856B4,I‚Äôve been here since the beginning of the series and honestly good for him on figuring this out and getting to collab with film theory
1,fwkAPU856B4,I got SO excited seeing your collab with MatPat!! I‚Äôm so glad two of the brightest theorists got together to tackle this one
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Okay hear me out. I just watched this series again today.
I believe that most of what the characters say are the literal truth, it‚Äôs just so bizarre that we look straight past it.
Like yellow guy saying: ‚Äúmy dad is a computer.‚Äù 
Or the literal intro of the series explicitly telling us over and over again: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just three of us. Look closely and you‚Äôll see.‚Äù 

I think the show is literally just the three of them going through different iterations of themselves. 
We‚Äôve seen the different levels of the house, we know they can be different shapes and sizes and objects and learn (and teach) new things to each other. 

I am thinking, each one of these ‚Äúteachers‚Äù is another version of themselves trying to escape or cope with the existential nightmare. 
The notepad is self discovery, the clock is suicide, the computer is distraction, the bee is acceptance, it‚Äôs all just them trying to escape in different formats. 

Btw Matt you can call me and we can discuss this."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"just watched all 6 videos on the playlist after watching matpat‚Äôs video, this whole playlist has been such a good binge! i absolutely love it! a total fluffer-nutter"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"On the Lesley dress there's the key(mean steve) and in the lamp shot we can see that on the bed there's the red salopette of the endin of the YouTube series, in the family episode near the family tree there's a duck doll and @MrMeow TheBestKitty has published practically the entire wakey wakey episode"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Something really interesting I noticed was that in episode 2 duck starts singing a song. He says, when you meet a business man, you must shake him by the hand. That's referencing the briefcase guy. He then says when you meet a family man, referencing the family episode. Then he says when you meet the choo choo man, referencing the train in the transportation episode. Then he says when you meet the friendly fellow, referencing Warren the Worm. Finally, he says when you meet the Plug-In man. This references every single episode of the show, but mysteriously not the coffin from Death. What if that's the order of events within the show?"
1,fwkAPU856B4,Awesome series bro. It‚Äôs been a trip.
1,fwkAPU856B4,Question: The DHMIS YouTube channel released 2 videos titled ‚ÄúHELP‚Äù and ‚ÄúHELP 2‚Äù Do they fit in the timeline or are they not cannon?
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I love when 2 great parties combine and work together, team theorist and Rem games 
I never knew about this channel but I'm glad you collaborated and I hope to see even more

Also Fluffer and nutter!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Just thinking and curious... If there's a battery replacement Lesley had whether that's her hidden supplies so as her window with a new set of batteries, Electracy's fresh pair of set, and Yellow guy rusting his own...

Doesn't this mean Lesley is already taking her betrayal portrayed already?



Also, adding up another thought:

Duck at Epi. 6 is seen envying Yellow guy for his awakening but yet in the process, Lesley replaced him with a new reset, but we didn't see Red guy being replaced - just tidied up the room...

Does that mean there's a better chance Red guy can be the one igniting the pieces for them to awaken in unison??


Wow. I hope so.

Btw, this theory is LIT!! Love love the efforts to make this series a whole research.

Kindly do some digging from Roy's perspective, that might take another turn on the events given!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Going from Game Thoery to Remigames is like fluffer-nutter, absolutely divine."
1,fwkAPU856B4,Just finished the mattpat one I've been waiting what feels like forever in the final part of your dhmis series amazing AMAZING job. Thank you for what you do. Look forward to your future videos.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Man, that was such a FLUFFER-NUTTER episode. 

I also loved your colab with Mat-Pat, You did a stellar job!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Honestly my main question is HOW DOES ROY FIT IN. as he must still have power as he‚Äôs still able to watch them BUT Lesley is like the main villain, I get he‚Äôs not as important but I don‚Äôt really get what happened to him. Did Roy volunteer yellow guy to replace David (the interview) or something like that"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I have no clue how you can figure this stuff out, you are honestly a genius. This show is absolutely fluffer-nutters!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Excited to ""find"" another amazing theory channel! You're an excellent theorist and glad have a whole bunch of new videos to watch! Fluffer-nutter :3"
1,fwkAPU856B4,While I love all these theory and all the other ones as well a common thing is see is that they ignore the psychological amd emotional aspect of the show which is some of my favorite because the crazy timeliness and foreshadowing in the show is so intriguing but so Is all the relationships and relations to the INTENSE TRAUMA this characters are going through‚úåÔ∏è
1,fwkAPU856B4,When yellow guy first sees the stairs and is walking over to them. He is not in the picture. It's only once he starts walking up them that he is seen in the picture frame. I believe he hasn't walked up those stair until that moment! The beginning of the loop as such. Congratulations on the matpack vid. You deserved it man üëäüèª
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Been here since the first theory you made, and I‚Äôm so happy to see you and matpat collab. Both amazing theorists such alike minds."
1,fwkAPU856B4,So I was so happy to see you Fluffernutter theory show up in Film Theory! I really hope you and Matpat work on my DHMIS stuff together. Also Fluffernutter is a ridiculous thing to ask fans to comment and it gives me life.
1,fwkAPU856B4,Just heard of your channel for the last film theory and I definitely see why you too would make for great collaboration videos I will be watching more of your content
1,fwkAPU856B4,"So happy for you Rem, and congrats on the collab! Your hard work did more than pay off, can‚Äôt wait to see more ü•≥ü•≥"
1,fwkAPU856B4,After seeing most of wakey wakey I was very surprised to see how bad the writing in that pilot was. It didn't feel like the pilot was written by the writers of the original dhmis.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Congratulations in getting on mat pats vid, well deserved"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"So I was watching this and saw how the mom in the other family (The Fluffer- Nutter family)  is present when represented as a human.  Roy is a protective father, sometimes violently protective. So when the Flutter Nutter family was going to eat Yellow guy Roy could see his boy was in trouble. Even Yellow guy knee he was in trouble because he said Dad I KNEW you would come. Roy comes in and pushes Yellow guy out the room and Yellow Guy knows Roy is about to be destructive.  That is why the family is represented as puppets. They are dead also. Roy murdered the Flutter Nutters to defend a replica of David who is still important to Leslie even though he's NOT her real son. Leslie wishes Roy would have saved David then when he could not because he was in the house."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"Great set of videos! You put a lot of thought into this and it shows.

One thing about the show that could very well be nothing but sticks in the back of my mind is the Grolton and Hovris tv show. In episode 3 we see some of it after which yellow guy comments ""Grolton is the dog"". Red guy then corrects him, saying Hovris is the dog an Grolton is the man. In episode 5 we see some more G&H, after which yellow guy AGAIN says ""Grolton is the dog""; this time duck corrects him. Again, this could just be a joke but knowing what we know now about yellow guy, how he's not as dumb as he seems and he made the same ""error"" twice... maybe there's something there. Still wouldn't know what that could mean though."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I know everyone else is also saying it, but i'm really happy you got to collab with film theory/matpat. I found your videos through dhmis analysis and there's a lot of effort put into them that i think deserves an audience.

It sounded like you had fun and hopefully it helps people find you and your other videos. Keep up the good work!"
1,fwkAPU856B4,"This is kind of a weird question, but does the show have enough evidence on how humans play a role? Is it humans turned to puppets after death? Is it an apocalyptic nightmare recreated for the entertainment of the council? Just curious on what you think is going on there even if it's just speculation."
1,fwkAPU856B4,I love this show so much <3
1,fwkAPU856B4,"My big question is what does the reset after red guys mind blowing at Episode 6 of the Youtube Show mean? I feel they created props and things for it and as a result due to budgeting, I think its unlikely to be a mere metaphorical idea. 

Could there be a tie-in to wakey wakey somehow"
1,fwkAPU856B4,This was an amazing timeline video!! You should award yourself with a fluffer-nutter.
1,fwkAPU856B4,"The way I see don‚Äôt hug me I‚Äôm scared is that the YouTube series is like this: The YouTube series is Red Guy‚Äôs backstory, or his character‚Äôs backstory. The new series is yellow Guy‚Äôs backstory and character growth. Wakey Wakey is the Duck‚Äôs story background. I would have assumed this because of MatPat saying the duck was in charge of Clay hill."
1,fwkAPU856B4,"I‚Äôve always thought some things from the show were a bit strange, specifically to do with straying from the norm 
unemployed Brendan is portrayed in a negative light and points out his novel 
stain edwards is repeatedly pushed away from what he wants to be and is later experimented on
there‚Äôs a prevalent pushing of family norms of course, but the scene where red guy is seen as the weird one in his family is specifically noteworthy 
yellow guy needs to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù when he‚Äôs enjoying his little brain friends. you could also mention how no one likes warrens podcast but that‚Äôs definitely just a silly
the gps tries to bring them back home
and yellow guy mentions in the mirror how his friends don‚Äôt like how he‚Äôs acting, with duck replacing the batteries

I don‚Äôt know how these tie together, if they even tie together but the first two are the most strange in my opinion, how those creatives get shot down and shunned in the show"
1,fwkAPU856B4,i legit came here from matpat/film theory and watched this entire series without actually intending to and i'm so glad i did. it was so good!
1,fwkAPU856B4,"My only correction to the theories would be the ending possibility.  I think an alternate ending would be that as Duck, Red Guy, and Yellow Guy/David, attempt to escape, the actors/writers try to control Lesley, it's why she has stitches now, they need to be able to thwart the escape plan...  And so the final conflict will be Lesley letting go and fighting the writers/crew, holding them back as the Main Trio escape and get to live their own lives.  Of course that's just my theory."

1,B0Qzzl900Us,"Whoever said that frosted sugar cookies are awful, you need to rethink where you went wrong in life. 
Whether it was your lack of a father, or any strong person to teach you how to act and behave in life, or if it was the barely noticeable peanut sized mass of meat inside of a skull which would serve more purpose as a Halloween decoration than protecting what little is inside."

1,WWWDskI46Js,Optimus's voice never gets old no matter how many times you've heard it..
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I loved when Optimus said ""it's primin' time"" and primed all over the enemies.
Truly one of the films made of all time"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Alfred Molina appeared and said ""Hello Prime"" I genuinely felt goosebumps. 
This is art."
1,WWWDskI46Js,Maybe just me but when optimus said ‚Äùwhat really happened in wuhang lab‚Äù it really gave me chills
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Prime said ‚ÄúI'm not an energy drink"" literally gave me chills."
1,WWWDskI46Js,I like how the gorillabot jumps down out of nowhere and beats its chest in the most aggressive way possible and then acts shocked that Optimus viewed him as a threat.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Man, if i resume the trailer in only one word: Amazing. Prime's voice never changes, the action is in the best quality of the franchise, the CGI is really cool, etc. The only things I would change in the movie is that I'd make Gary Chalk reprise Optimus Primal after 26 years and make Prime's faceplate-less face more like his face in Cyberverse, but the rest, is just the best
PS: If Prime at one point says to Primal ""Truck, not monkey!"", I think I'm gonna going to freak out in the theather"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Prime said ""For Frodo..."" and charged towards the armies of Mordor.

Goosebumps..."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Optimus says ""Call the phone, same number, same hood, it's all good"", a chill went through my spine. Dialogue superb."
1,WWWDskI46Js,The part where Optimus prime says ‚Äú this is Sparta!‚Äù Gave me goosebumps.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message to any surviving Autobots taking refuge among the stars. We are here. *We will be watching this absolute banger*"
1,WWWDskI46Js,So happy to see some Beast Wars inspired characters. Can't wait to see the design of Megatron T-Rex.
1,WWWDskI46Js,The part where Optimus Prime Said ‚ÄúHakuna Matata‚Äù .... chills down my spine.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I loved when Optimus said ""it's primin' time"" and primed all over the enemies.
Truly one of the films made of all time"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The part where Optimus Prime said ""Houston we have a problem"" gave me chills"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"It's been 1.5 decade of transformer's sequels, Optimus prime's voice remains same ‚ù§Ô∏è Feels never gets old üî• ""Let them come"" üî•"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Prime says, ""I take my oil black...like a gorilla."" Primal blushed and got goosebumps!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"My favourite scene is when Optimus Prime shouts ‚ÄúWe forgot the crackers, Gromit!‚Äù All the chills!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The best part is when primal says ""this is the rise of the beasts"". Really a movie of all time"
1,WWWDskI46Js,I don't know why I'm so in love with the sound that Primal Prime makes when he transforms
1,WWWDskI46Js,The fact that their doing the 80's look on the Transformers is by far the best and hearing Peter Cullens iconic voice is putting the icing on the cake this movie looks great
1,WWWDskI46Js,No matter how many times I watch that outro it still feels soo smooth
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Despite how bad the previous Transformers movies were, I loved every second of them.  So utterly badass.  Even if this movies isn't ""good"", I'm still excited for it!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I love how they're mixing the live action CGI with the designs from both old and new transformers toys and shows, it's just- exciting, to say the least"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I love how these films look, I will never get bored of looking at transformers films BUT is it really that hard to get some better story than ""there is a darkness coming""?"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"This just makes me feel like a kid again. I may be a grown-ass adult, but the child in me is loving this so much."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The part when Optimus Prime said ""Avengers! Unite!!!"" gave me goosebumps."
1,WWWDskI46Js,i‚Äôve seen this trailer at least 20 times since it dropped! i‚Äôm so ready for a reboot and something different and refreshing from this franchise. bring on June 9th!!!
1,WWWDskI46Js,"""Let Them Come"" enough for Goosebumps ü•∂"
1,WWWDskI46Js,Finally!! I seriously can't wait for this to come out. This will be one awesome movie üî•üî•üî•
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The part where Optimus said ""Autobots return to Monke"" gave me shivers"
1,WWWDskI46Js,When Optimus Prime said ‚ÄòYou reap what you woe‚Äô I got goosebumps
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The idea of the music being ""It was all a dream"" and the end with ""This can't be real- okay it's real"" essentially just feels like my inital thoughts of ROTB and then me after seeing the trailer. Holy shit this needs to do good, this is how live action Transformers should've been done."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"""Let them come"" This truly has to be the movie of all time."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"My favorite part is when Shia Labeouf said, ""I'm not a Hero"" and then proceeded to do the morbi-dance all over Optimus prime. Truly a Transformers experience."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Peter Cullen is and always will be Optimus Prime, and he will never cease to make me smile with joy."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"This look legitimately so good, I really liked bumblebee I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre sticking with the classic g1 looks"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"This is the most hyped I‚Äôve ever been for a movie this looks amazing !! When Optimus Primal transformers,  sick af"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I'm pumped and ready for this to come out, I'm jumping up and down in my house, excited, so excited I haven't slept in 2 days.. definitelyüëÅÔ∏è looking forward to this."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Optimus said ""Let them come"", Im feeling him coming inside me"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"The 1990s generation that grew up on Beast Wars will be jumping in joy. That show was so far ahead of its time in terms of graphics (only rivaled by REBOOT) and even had a legendary scene between Optimus Primal and Optimus Prime, which still gives me goosebumps thinking about that moment when it aired back in the day."
1,WWWDskI46Js,I like how the gorillabot jumps down out of nowhere and beats its chest in the most aggressive way possible and then acts shocked that Optimus viewed him as a threat.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Loved the part where Optimus says, ""City boy! City booooooy!"""
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I genuinely don't know why people are saying the cgi is bad, I think this reveal is what transformers needs now to bring itself back into the spotlight of everyone's minds."
1,WWWDskI46Js,I love the voice of Optimus Prime. It never gets old. My all time favorite movie üé¶ TRANSFORMERS
1,WWWDskI46Js,I also love how primal is a bit more battle ready as well as being more sage-like than previous entries
1,WWWDskI46Js,I don‚Äôt care what people say I‚Äôm still watching transformers üòÇ
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I did wonder how long it would be before ""Optimus Primal"" made his debut! Ron Perlman was a good choice to voice him. üëçüèΩü¶çüíØ"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"It makes you want to watch Beast Wars again, so much nostalgia."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Some of the Transformers sequels might not like it, but all of them are extraordinary in terms of effects, etc., especially the sound of Optimus Prime üò≠üôè I can't wait for the film to be released üòâ"
1,WWWDskI46Js,That transformation from a Jaguar or whatever that animal is after Optimus said ‚ÄúLet them come‚Äù was crazy. Hyped
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Optimus said ""If you dont know, now you know"" gave me chills"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Looks dope, I was wondering when they would make a transformers beast wars!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"As a 43 year old still living in my mother's basement, let me just say this movie looks AWESOME!!!!!!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Frankly, I can't just for this movie to be out. The producers of transformers are wow!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,Every time I hear prime voice tears full my eyes his voice full of hope
1,WWWDskI46Js,Eeeee agora sim senti emo√ß√£o kkkkkk
1,WWWDskI46Js,Y'all have to give the studio credit for making Optimus look like G1 Optimus.  Makes me feel like a kid again 
1,WWWDskI46Js,FINALLY Worth the wait üî•
1,WWWDskI46Js,I felt like i was the only kid obsessed with Beast Wars as a kid and I still am. I am SO HAPPY that its back. The childhood continues to live on!
1,WWWDskI46Js,about time!! i wish they made primal prime more like the beast war version.
1,WWWDskI46Js,When Optimus Prime said: ‚ÄúI want to see GTA 6 trailer!‚Äù I got goosebumps
1,WWWDskI46Js,Optimus Prime voice is a voice of two generations!! That man is beloved and when he leaves us - it‚Äôs gonna be hard but what a legacy to leave and the souls to have touched!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Optimus Prime said 'Adrian! ' , Goosebumps.."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Happy to see the Maximals Squad getting some recognition. A lot of 90s kids (myself included) grew up watching the famous Beast Wars TV show so I'm definitely excited! I saw Optimus Primal, Cheetor, Rhino and Airazor. Hopefully they can add other iconic characters like Rattrap, Dinobot and Blackarachnia üíØüëèüèª"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Optimus Prime said ""WAKANDA FOREVER"", I got goosebumps!!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,Wow this looks really good. I'm a child of 72' so this brings back some nostalgia from the early days of the cartoon.
1,WWWDskI46Js,That transformation at the end was awesome
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When optimus prime said, ""I can drink a bottle of water"" - goosebumps üò±üò°"
1,WWWDskI46Js,Peter Cullen's voice of Optimus Prime never gets old üòç
1,WWWDskI46Js,I'm really looking forward to it. I love Optimus Prime.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1,WWWDskI46Js,Please don't screw up Rhinox. He is one of my favorites from the Beast wars.
1,WWWDskI46Js,i literally thought of transformers before the trailer came out. i was like its about time they start making a comeback super stoked looks like a lower budget film but this can also mean a larger pool for its next movie!!!!
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When transformers came out in 2007 I was 4y/old, I'm now a grown man and my 20th birthday is in a week. happy to see Optimus prime again and again."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"No matter how negative the world can be, Optimus Prime is always the voice of optimism"
1,WWWDskI46Js,Perfect great very beautiful I love all the transformers series I'm so happy the series is continuing thank you so much for doing this I'm so glad to learn that thank you so much to the producers and publishers of Transformers. and also music it's great
1,WWWDskI46Js,I love how they‚Äôre bring primal into the movie now:)
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Great, another transformers movie, just what everybody asked for!"
1,WWWDskI46Js,From the moment I finished watching the first Micheal Bay transformers movie I have been thinking about how cool it would be if they did the same thing for beast wars.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"with the passing of Kevin Conroy, we need to be grateful for Peter Cullen as one of the few living legends that give life to the character as we all know and love. <3"
1,WWWDskI46Js,My favourite part was when Optimus said‚Äù I ordered it medium rare on his prime rib‚Äù literal tears
1,WWWDskI46Js,So so looking forward for this its been a long time coming  simply awesome
1,WWWDskI46Js,Awesome can‚Äôt wait to watch it looks awesome ‚ù§
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When Prime said its ""Prime time"" i got goosebumps."
1,WWWDskI46Js,The transforming animation is so well done that parts are clear where they are placed and not just disappearing out of nowhere.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I love the part when the asteroid hits the waterfall scene, the end...."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Storyline wise, the best way to watch the movies is by watching Bumblebee first, this movie second & the other Transformers movies after those two. Bumblebee is the beginning of the story, this movie is the middle of the story & the other Transformers movies are the ending of the story. Also, I think there's going to eventually be more of these movies as well. It's going to be quite a long time until I watch these movies then. Gotta watch from the beginning of the story to the end, otherwise it doesn't make any sense."
1,WWWDskI46Js,Admit it ... at the very beginning of the trailer when the kid exits the car like a boss ... we all wish we could show up at work like that ...
1,WWWDskI46Js,"okay.....I'm not gonna lie. While the series has had its hit and misses (As all series do) I cant help but shutter in sheer joy for this! I absolutely loved and I mean LOVED beast wars! Ahead of its time, along with Reboot haha. I got so giddy when I saw cheetor and primal omg omg omg Did yall see dinobots spining blade??? A big part of me hopes this leads to a final death of prime, passing his mantel on to primal, leading into unicron...a whole beast wars trilogy. yessssss yesssss"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Let‚Äôs just all be thankful Peter Cullen is still well enough to lend his talent yet again, a living legend."
1,WWWDskI46Js,I love the cast and the voice actors but is it just me or does optimus looks small cause when he standed next to the humans I couldn‚Äôt believe it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ig they have time for improvement üòÆ
1,WWWDskI46Js,Now that's what I'm waiting for ahhhhh roll outüòç
1,WWWDskI46Js,The CGI on Transformers movies are absolutely sublime. Holy
1,WWWDskI46Js,Haven't been excited for a transformers movie in years. Didnt see Bumblebee but this looks promising
1,WWWDskI46Js,When prime said ‚ÄùAVENGERS!!!! Assemble!!!!‚Äù Goosebumps literally got chills.
1,WWWDskI46Js,"Oh man, looks like Battletrap is going to be badass. It looks like he has Prime at his mercy"
1,WWWDskI46Js,"People have recently been complaining about movies being too long, which is somewhat vexing to me...

I wouldn't enjoy a Transformers picture if it were merely 90mins long..."
1,WWWDskI46Js,"I am 32 years old. When I was a boi I started my day watching BeastWars, every fucking morning. I had all the toys. Not sad to say im looking forward to collecting every single new toy that comes out for this. This was gorgeous. The animals to the old school look of the transformers. This is the best."
1,WWWDskI46Js,Finally i will watch a perfect movie after a long time üòÄ
1,WWWDskI46Js,"When optimus said and I am optimus prime ""snap"", give me chillsü•∂"

1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"That kiss for Denji is the perfect definition for ""I've won, but at what cost!"" üíÄ"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This scene never fails to be disturbing
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,The sibling energy radiating from Power's teasing is something else.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"""Weeeell, that's gonna leave some trauma."" He just said it so matter of factlyüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"That scream in his head was so genuine, this dub really is killing it"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,The way how Ryan Colt Levy delivered that ‚ÄúPUKE‚Äù line had me dying
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This never fails to make me laugh lmao
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Makima‚Äôs little ‚ÄúOh, my‚Äù will never not be funny"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Well, at least Denji will never forget his first kiss"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This girl himeno legit bird-fed Denji. Somebody get this man some ginger ale
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Denji so far is the embodiment of ‚Äúsuffering from success‚Äù
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I just like that Power laughs at everything.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I love Sarah as Power‚Ä¶ Got her laughing like a manic üòÇ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"In the manga, power had more endearing dialogue, she said ""this is bad, denji has the habit of swallowing anything in his mouth that has nutritional value!""

Im pretty sure it was power at least"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Power's laughter is very good.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,THE MAN STILL SWALLOWS IT üíÄ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Power just knows how to lighten the mood.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Poor Denji; too bad Himeno will never be able to make it up to him.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,He was waiting for 16 years for a kiss and that‚Äôs how he gets it üò≠
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Power just PISSING herself laughing is the best part
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I love Powers english va. That sadistic laugh sounds so genuine. They probably told her dad jokes before recording XD
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,OH MY GOD DENJI AND POWERS VAs KILLED IT HERE ü§£ü§£ü§£
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Himeno: ""My first kiss went a little like this: chu And twist! Chu chu and twist!""

Denji: ""Well my first kiss went a little like this:"""
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,it's like watching a bird feed their young
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"If I had a nickel for every time I saw a scene in an animated series this year where a drunk chick vomits ü§Æ in another guys mouth(the Legend of Vox Machina), I‚Äôd have two nickels. Which isn‚Äôt a lot but it‚Äôs weird that it‚Äôs happened twice ü§î"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,That‚Äôs got to be the best and worst kiss of all time
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Power manages to make everything funny, I love her"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"0:29 & 0:36 of Power's none stop laughing + teasing towards Denji, sounded pure fucking ""EVIL"" in this scene...!"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"How well Denji ate that night, a true Capo who really has such legendary luck XD"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,lmao I seen it in the Japanese version it was hilariously grossüòÇ poor denji.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Denji: No amount of therapy will ever make this ok
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This is why I don't mess with drunk people. üç∫ ü§¢
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"This is one of those scenes when your parents walk in and you can‚Äôt explain what‚Äôs going on, just accept the pain your enduring right now"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This scene traumatized me lmaoüòÇüòÇ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,What did i just witness üò≠ this scene definitely caught me by surprise üòÇ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,No amount of therapy will ever make this moment okay
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"I knew the puke was coming (thanks sub fans) but when he swallowed it... I spat out my water. That's just foul, and rip to the people who sat down with a nice meal to eat while watching this episode..."
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Poor Denji, even when he‚Äôs winning he still loses"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,0:38 the way power says ‚Äúway worse‚Äù ‚ò†Ô∏è
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This might be the one time where I don't wanna see the uncensored version üòë
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Denji and Power are the best characters in this series, I could also say I like Aki, he just wants to get rid of them"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Love this show üòÜ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Of course this came up right when I was eating dinner. Think it's safe to say that I no longer have an appetite...
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Well it's never official: never let a drunk girl kiss you or vice versa
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,ü§£ü§£ü§£ it made me laugh in the manga & the anime
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I SAY HIMENO KISSES DENJI ONCE OF THE LIFE TIME HAVING SEX IS BETTER THAN BAKI HANMA AND KOZUE MATSUMOTO ON EPISODE 8
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,What Power said is the funniest shit ever but knowing Denji's past makes it a little sad too
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,You know him swallowing the puke made us all die a little inside ...
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Okay this part of this episode is beyond DISGUSTING!!!üò±ü§¢ü§Æü§Æ
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"I cringed and physically gaged when this episode aired.
Great work , animators!üòÉ>ü§¢"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Denji: ""I'm a minor! Stop!"""
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I just flipped my damn table like bro denji really swallowed puleü§£
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"That was very disgusting that Denji swallowed the vomit after she threw up in his mouth in a disturbing way, he really should have spit out the vomit. He might have getting sick of the vomit."
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Pochita: I gave myself up for this?!
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,WHY DOES HE SWALLOW IT?!?!?!?!?
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"japanese dub: that's... puke!

1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,ü§Æü§Æü§ÆI just watched that episode and it was both disgusting and really disturbing!!! But at least Denji got something better than a kiss at the end of this episode ‚Äúwanna do it?‚Äù
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I think I would legit move cities if this happened
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Fun fact: mappa censored this scene not because it's gross but because they though it was funnier this way
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,This went from hot to eww so fast
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I love Himeno.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"If you‚Äôre ever thinking of looking at the uncensored version‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not worth it.

1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,That kiss was cool until the vomit thing happen
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,WHOA LOOK AT THAT HIMENO KISSES DENJI THIS IS AMAZING
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Oh, that‚Äôs gonna leave some trauma."
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"This pure kino, no one can tell me otherwise!"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Hell yeah best kiss ever awesome that's my boy dejni.
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I love powers voice
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,I didn't see that coming

1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Oh yeah, remember this nightmare. This also happened twice in ‚Äú6teen‚Äù."
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,He got the Kiss and a Free Lunch ;)
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"So I don‚Äôt really keep up with this series but, why did he swallow it?"
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,Average kiss in Ohio be like:
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,God I hope it‚Äôs uncensored in the blue ray
1,WKJ2X4dMTH0,"Damn Crunchyroll, not now üò≠"

1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just start I‚Äôll learn as I play‚Äù when they know absolutely nothing about how to start is painfully accurate
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"God, that ‚ÄúI dunno, I dunno‚Äù bit at the beginning is the most dead-on accurate impression of my dad 3 words into a game explanation I can imagine. One of the smartest guys I know and his brain absolutely shuts down when it comes to learning a new game."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The most frustrating thing about this is that codenames is actually incredibly easy to explain lmao
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,We tried to introduce my mother-in-law to Catan. She was grumpy and willfully obtuse about it the whole time and we basically held her hand through the whole game so she ended up winning. Then suddenly she liked it. We have never played a board game with her since.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This is so painfully accurate, it hurts me. As the main ‚Äúboard game person‚Äù of my friend group, peoples‚Äô lack of attention spans has led me to almost not really want to play anymore, and just watch videos of people playing board games - and then just kinda fantasize what it would be like if I was there üòÖ

Ik that sounds really sad, but I do love my friends - they just have the attention span of a squirrel üêø"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"""So the goal is not to die.""
Everyone else: ""Too complicated. Let's just play Uno."""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,And the sequel: Everyone plays with different house rules but they refuse to discuss which rules to follow before starting
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I can feel the soul leave my body when I finish explaining the rules, then one person in the group looks up from their phone and goes ""Sorry, what was that?"""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The lengths some people go to avoid learning new things is remarkable
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The absolute look of disbelief when he asked what cards were had me on the floor.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Fun fact: the Brazilian release of Codenames was originally released as Codinomes, which is a pretty straightforward translation, but it turns out it's not a very used word in Portugual, so the second release changed the name to C√≥digo Secreto (Secret Code) to help sell it in the Portuguese market.

So there actually were, presumably, lots of people saying 'what's Codenames?'"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"One of my friends once asked, ""Why do we always have to listen to all these rules? Why can't we just play and figure it out?"" So I just looked at the new game I was about to start teaching, looked back at him and said, ""Okay then, play."" He stared at the board for a minute and then called me an asshole."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is probably your best skit in a while. It's just so accurate and yet hilarious
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This is so accurate. Only things missing are the host having to constantly remind everyone ‚Äúit‚Äôs fun, trust me‚Äù and that one person who was on their phone the whole explanation getting mad because of a rule you explained 3 times disrupting their whole game."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,don't forget the helpful other player who already knows the rules and interrupts you constantly to explain something that's not necessary to know at that point
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"The ""what does this mean??"" ""we'll get to that...."" is such an accurate mood LOL. My brother and I run into this problem all the time in family board game nights, once our parents really get it it's smooth sailing and we can play board games with like 1000 components to them, but the first time playing a board game is always agony. Also my dad will complain that a new game isn't fun if he doesn't win on the very first time but that's a separate issue LOL"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"*God* the whole sighing resignation bit at the beginning was *so fucking accurate.* Like, yeah, you're not gonna know what the hell's going on right away, just sit down and pay attention, I'll walk you through it. Don't act all defeated and overwhelmed before we've even attempted to start learning the rules!"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"The way he's just *stunned* that someone would ask ""what are cards."""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"As the resident 'Explain the rules' guy for my own group, this... is painfully relatable."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"""what are cards? I haven't started yet"" I admire your patience to even try to explain it to braindead people in the first place"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The funniest part of this skit to me is that Sungwon is probably one of the best people you could possibly have explaining board game rules to you. üòÇ
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I feel a tiny bit called out because I did this exact thing when my brother tried to teach me, you guessed it, codenames. It was way back but I should probably apologize"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This guy is so good at making relatable humor that I somehow feel like I‚Äôm both of these people at the same time
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I literally had this exact conversation with a friend of mine the other day (about this exact game!). I was the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt get it‚Äù guy. üòÖ
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"The number of times I'll explain a thing to someone and they'll interrupt with ""Well, I don't know anything about that"" I'm just like ""... Yeah, but *I* do, which is why you just *asked* me to explain it to you"" is too high for me to count"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,You have performed a public service with this one. ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù guy is my literal nemesis
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I feel this so deep down in my bones it actually made me angry watching it. So true, Sir, so true."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"As much as I would like to play a board game with friends, I realized early on that I wouldn't be a good player if there wasn't a theme or game mechanic that I could ""get it"" outright. Also definitely felt this, being the guilty party of ""step by step plz...wait what is this?"""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"As someone that wants to play WAY too many board games for the people around me to deal with:
YES! THIS EXACTLY!"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This is so brilliant!
I want to add the widened stare of the person that just realized what they got themselves into when they are obviously lost after the first sentence of explanation.

Also, extra points for questions of ""is it like Uno?"" and ""I like Monopoli, can we play that?"""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Oh the classic ""I've decided to be confused before you even started explaining"" players are the best... yep the best"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is a mood. I've had a similar situation happen with explaining some of my boardgames... sometimes they'd literally rather learn while playing when that really isn't the best way to learn the basics.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I will say, ""teach as you play"" is my absolute favorite way to teach a game, I do it with my kids all the time. The thing is, it only works if players are okay choosing between options they don't understand and having a few quick rounds that are chaotic and dumb. It's a true ""learning game"" and we run through it fast and sloppy just to see how things happen and so players can pull levers and push buttons. Then we reset and play again."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Teaching boardgames to people who don't play boardgames is pretty tough. I tried to teach my family Catan for Thanksgiving, since I thought it had pretty straightforward rules. My brother figured it out easily, but my parents acted like it was rocket science."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Its called CODENAMES because the names of the inventors of the game are Jeremy, Bethany, Anthony, Emily, Zachary, Delaney, Cassidy and Marc. When you take the first letter of all those names and remove 3 of them and add 4 new ones and put them in a different order it means deckname which is German for Codename.
Obviously."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is literally my experience trying to get my friends to play Codenames. I hadn't even begun taking the components out of the box and my friend's wife was already whining and acting like she isn't smart enough to form a complete sentence let alone learn a simple game.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I‚Äôve never connected more deeply to anything more than this
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I tried to explain THIS EXACT GAME to my grandma and brother and it was honestly the worst experience of my life. They were on their phones the entire time so I got angry and gave up.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Ugh this is so accurate it hurts. I've also been a little bit the other guy, asking people to explain as we play instead of trying to teach me before we've taken all the pieces out."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This whole skit is spot on for those of us that are tasked with explaining the rules. Very funny.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This video is the exact reason why half of my collection are small games that don't take more than 5 minutes to teach. Most of my friends don't play a lot of board games and, well, aren't good at learning how to play them lol. If they aren't having fun within 10 minutes of the game hitting the table, they want to play something else"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I've been on both sides of this so it's pretty hilarious. The other extreme is someone explaining the game to you in words before you even see the board, or what anything looks like, or have the context to understand what's even being said or why it's going to matter during the flow of the game. Finding a middle ground between over-explaining until overwhelmed and jumping in with no knowledge whatsoever is surprisingly tough."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Haha, you've made me realize explaining boardgames is very much like showing someone a movie you like"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I‚Äôve found that the best way to explain the rules of a game is to just lock someone in a room with the instructional pamphlet and refuse to release them until they can win a game.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,Bro you're literally touching my soul with this. I can remember the pain as a kid trying to play some games with my mother and every time we had to start explaining from the beginning (even if we played the same game 3 days before 'cause apparently information could not stick to her brain). That and many other examples made me question how these people can be fully functioning in the real world.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,It's also hilarious that this game is possibly one of the simplest ones out there.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"‚ÄúHeaven & Earth‚Äôs second gateway is a game in which 4 cards are drawn from a deck 12 times, then you match the cards corresponding to their month, landscape, and element. After you‚Äôve finished doing that you do it a second tim-‚Äú
‚ÄúIs this even a board game?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶ no‚Äù"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,You're a master at capturing the many frustrations of being a board game enthusiast.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"You are insanely gifted at capturing random small hilarious things so accurately, that head shake at the start my goodness. So fucking funny."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"For codenames, it might actually be good to just play and explain as you go, especially if you have multiple people making guesses and the new player won't be alone"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"That one guy that goes from ""I'll learn along the game"" to ""IDK"" lol relatable 10/10. I tried explaining Betrayal to my family and this is relatable"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Explaining the rules to casuals is an art-form, I spend ages rehearsing an explanation which summarises it early to make them feel like they understand before I actually tell them the nitty gritty."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Really appreciating that these videos aren't in YT short format. I see you ProZD, and I appreciate you."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is literally what it‚Äôs like to work at an escape room and having to explain the rules to (esp first time) customers
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"If someone sits down to a modern Euro-Style game and says, ""I'll figure it out as we play"" you can be assured their go-to game is Scrabble."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"God this is so good. As someone who regularly explains board games, this is the most accurate representation of my life ever."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"We played Codenames about 5 weeks ago, this is an accurate representation of the first 5 minutes. Then someone got mildly annoyed and everyone listened for 3 minutes and we played a game slowly and it was smooth sailing."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I like how he picked one of the simplest games, too. It takes less than 5 minutes to explain, if everyone sits down and puts their phones away to listen."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This happens to me and my friends every time we take out Risk. We love to play it but it's a long game and subsequently sees very little use. It's usually a challenge to remember how many dice to roll and the instructions on the box read poorly.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Sometimes I think board game enthusiasts are playing a separate, secret game where they try to see how thoroughly they can recite a rule book by memory, as well as the whole Wikipedia article for the game, and personal anecdotes about other times they‚Äôve played the game. Actually getting to eventually play the board game in question is an extra bonus, but is not required for the Rule-Reciting Game."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I love board games, LOVE THEM. And even I dont usually like the old ""time to learn how to play this from someone else explaining""

Couldnt imagine being neutral or even NOT liking board games and having to go through that.

That's why I generally give up with people who have no interest."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"The delivery of ""What?"" after ""What are cards""...holy shit. I've never heard so much incredulity packed into a single word."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Me, starting to explain a game:‚ÄùWe all start with 5 dollars‚Ä¶‚Äù
Player:‚ÄùWow, this is complicated!‚Äù"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"As someone who used to run a game club, this is very very accurate."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This is every time I try to go through the rules with my family before we try a new game. Every. Time. 
We've got three new games to go through this Christmas (Ticket to Ride, Azul, and...Codenames!) and I can 100% guarantee that if I try to explain any rules whatsoever they'll start rolling their eyes and telling me to get on with it."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,My favorite thing is how the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just start‚Äù people are the same people that will get upset if you say something is against the rules when they try to do it. ‚ÄúYou never said anything about that‚Äù
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I have never vibed with something so much. This is the reason I broke my boardgame group into 2. The won't-listen-to-directions/no-patience/this-is-to-complicated/can-we-just-play-secret-hitler group otherwise known as the idiot group and the normal group
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,The pain of wanting to share a great game with a friend and they immediatly reject it without even trying to understand and you understand you won't be able to play wiht them
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"you gotta start from ‚Äúok, hands off board/pieces while i explain‚Äù (or, apparently, from teaching [a] language to the players so they can refer to objects succinctly) but fr codenames is a lot of fun"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I've been there. Then you've the player who decides to play on their phone while you explain, while another goes to make coffee since ""we haven't started yet"" and another goes to the bathroom.

Then you start explaining and people butt in with corrections or to explain niche exceptions that don't make any sense without understanding the basic concepts.

Then inevitably people understand the game after a few rounds, but claim you never told them certain rules when they come up because they weren't paying any attention at all."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,You miss one crucial person: the one who already knows the rules and interrupts the person explaining them every two words to tell how they always play it and that you should explain stuff in a different order.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,i got into a friend group and they always had to explain the rules to me and constantly praised me for listening well and learning how to play so quickly. i can't believe these are the types of people they had to deal with before lmao
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Hey!     
Love everything, all content.  
Now that it is December,  

Maybe you could recommend some board games with a lot of replayability? My folks love games (Spice is an all time favourite, but all the big names like ticket to ride, codenames, etc) and play nearly every night - so it's tough to get them a game they consider ""worth learning"" or buying.


They won't buy games themselves...."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This reminds me of so many painful real life situations I have experienced.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Alternatively there's the blank look in their eyes as you calmly explain everything and they nod the whole time, and by the end of the game you've had to play every turn for them as they watched, and you still get the feeling they didn't learn a single rule the whole time."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Ooof, I felt that  ""Le'ts just play a few rounds"" before he even explained the core objective."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"The Passive-Aggressiveness in this is so beautiful, I can hear the ghosts of hundreds of conversation past"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Luckily I'm the person who loves explaining things
Sometimes I'll be sitting there reading the rules to a new game while everyone's hanging out and someone will be like ""I'm sorry we're just goofing off and not helping you learn how the game works"" and I'll be like I appreciate it, that's kind of you to say, but I'm having a blast just listening to everyone cause chaos üòÇ
Occasionally someone will be like ""wait are we playing this game then? I'm confused what are these pieces for?"" And I'll have to say I haven't even started explaining the rules yet but even that dynamic is good fun.
Let's be honest, sometimes spending half of board game night sitting around a half set up game while not playing is how you know you had a good board game night"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This Thanksgiving, I tried to explain uno to my family. They thought it was so ridiculously complicated that I had to be making up rules like the reverse card reverses order of play."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"""What are cards?""
""...What are CARDS?""

Couldn't stop laughing at this part for some reason ü§£"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"""How do you win"" is the equivalent of asking how to play the game. ü§£"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Now imagine me trying to explain Betrayal. ""What so we fight each other? Events? This is a house? Why is there another person on the back of this card? Wait so like there's a curse? I thought there were aliens. Am I supposed to kill you? Where's the gun? Wait wait wait, but you were just helping us a minute ago. What do you mean the haunt?!"""
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I've rewatched the first 5 seconds over 10 times. I'm totally doing this next time I play a game as soon as they start explaining.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I ran the board game club at my college and this is an incredible encapsulation of the experience . have had this exact experience with codenames
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Throwback to that time a group of friends and I were being taught how to play Clue but I was too busy drawing super mario on my wrist so I missed everything. I sat through the entire game without knowing how to play












I was clueless"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,I am irrationally angry over how accurate this is. It hurts my everything.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is exactly what happened the first time I played this game. Great game.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I love boardgames. I love playing them with, and showing them to, other people. I just wish I didn't have to interact with people for that to work, and this video embodies that."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is exactly how it feels to be a board game guy trying to explain any game that's more complicated than Uno to a group of non-board-game people
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"My friend explained Codenames to me just the other day, the game was pretty simple and pretty fun, also, if you don't immediately get all the rules, you can always have the friend that does make first play, though, for codenames it's both good and bad to go first."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I came out of incognito mode where I was watching to post this comment I was rolfing so hard.  Everything about this is exactly spot on.  What a journey of patience, hope, to dispair, and finally frustration, we've all been there."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"My friends and I have learned that I am the one who reads the rule, because I actually understand it, I then teach everyone how the game works. If there's only one or two people who don't know the game, everyone else shuts the hell up because they don't know how to explain it well and not overwhelm them with information. Explaining the rules of a game is an art"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,Then you have me who wants to learn it extremely in-depth before starting and ask nuanced questions about obscure scenarios.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"This so accurate to one of the buddies in my friend circle that it isn't even funny, just upsetting. This is exactly how he acted when I was showing him how to play Codenames.
He ended up giving clues like ""timed gator"" to have them guess 'Clock' and 'Alligator'; like no dude, that is exactly how NOT to play."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,Now imagine being the traitor in a game. No clue what the hell you're doing and can't ask anyone to explain the traitor rules for you.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"That ""What? No, I wanna play"" speaks to me, I don't like playing games I've never played because I feel like i'm a pain for the person i'm playing with, because in addition to explaining the game to me, there's also the fact that I'm not gonna remember the rules, but I say I want to play because I know the other person wants me to play with them, and I'm unable to say no"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"I‚Äôm not a board game enthusiast but the ‚ÄúWhat? No, I want to play‚Äù sounds so relatable"
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,This is perfectly accurate to the episode where patrick loses his wallet. This also reminds me of all the dnd players who do not even care to read a spell before announcing that they cast it.
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"Good thought about game design tbqh: there are people who don't mind taking an L on the first game just to learn the rules, so if the game isn't drawn out and the rules can be clearly established within a single game then maybe that'll make for a good game."
1,gUrRsx-F_bs,"""Codenames"" name explanation: You activate agents, and you do it by their codenames/call-signs. That's why if you ""activate"" the wrong person they will be confused."
1,adGOhT09RZ4,"Anytime they start with ""I ain't gonna lie"" they're typically about to lie."

1,adGOhT09RZ4,"That's how you know people are about to lie. ""I ain't gon' lie..."" The same thing with ""No offense but..."" they aboutbto offend you. Or ""Not to sound racist but..."" they about to say some f'ed up sh*t. üòÇ"

1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Rick becoming agreeable with Morty shows his character development. This really proves that he is becoming a better person here. Plus, I just love the throwback they did from the Vat of Acid episode by jumping into the sun using the same exact pose they used from when they jumped into the fake acid."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I like that Rick's blindspot to magic keeps hitting him. He has gotten better at it, but that bone lady messed him up."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"This episode is like a redemption to the Vat of Acid episode. Here, the vat of acid (or lava) serves more as a safety net if anything goes wrong - and such is the role that Rick realizes he should take with Morty. Honestly, the characters have been growing up so much this season I'm starting to worry how are we gonna get that many more episodes of Rick and Morty hahaha"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,it's great to see Rick try to be a better person and Morty trying to go along with the Adventure this was a Great episode can't wait for the season finale
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Honestly I like this new rick approach. It's very intriguing and it gives everyone in the family including him a chance to grow.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This season has been stellar. I especially enjoyed the Jerry episodes. Can‚Äôt wait to see how they wrap up season 6.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Felt like Morty‚Äôs been kind of sidelined throughout Season 6, so an episode like this was exactly what I was hoping for. For being an episode that progresses Rick and Morty‚Äôs dynamic, this episode‚Äôs definitely a personal favorite of mine this season"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"what i really like about this episode is that rick being open to change is paying off for not just him, morty, or even just the family; by seeing through the whole fiasco to the end they ended a tradition of mutilation and brought scientific advancement to the whole solar system! which i think is a cool reflection of this growth"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Anyone else see so much of Rick‚Äôs personality in Morty this episode?
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I honest to God was literally never expecting that whole speech at the end to be leading up to a Vat of Acid jump. I really thought that was all real before the pose lmao
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I love this episode üòç
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I've been going through a bit of a personal growth recently, I can understand the challenges of change. I love this struggling, kinder Rick."

1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Rick and Morty do love each other, and not afraid to say it, made me tear.  Go Rick and Morty!"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"This is an episode in which the eighth part of Dan Harmon‚Äôs story circle, ‚ÄúHaving Changed‚Äù, is more clear than any other. The Solar System changed. Morty changed. Rick changed. It‚Äôll be interesting to see where this goes in the finale."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"It‚Äôs honestly good to see Rick try to be a better person, he still has his ego and it‚Äôs consistently put to the test but it‚Äôs really shown in this episode that he really is trying to be a better person, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all that progression he‚Äôs made was tore down by the encounter of Rick Prime as that‚Äôs exactly the catalyst to reset this progression back to 0."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,It was nice seeing Rick trying to be more positive with Morty. Especially considering that he and other Ricks view his attachment as a defect. I've always enjoyed the scenes where he shows familial affection.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I laughed so hard at the end at the realization that it was All one joke. Well done team
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I totally expected the solar system would to somehow not actually rotate around the sun and actually rotate around the staff
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I was dying when they started to celebrate that morty destroyed his first religion with physics
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,One of the best non finale episodes so far.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Thought it was a relatively middling episode for most of it. But the ending had me on the floor. I loved the callback to my favourite episode that original had me laughing so much.
If the series ended with them escaping Evil Morty, or Rick Prime of Cthulu by jumping into a vat of fake something as the final resolution in season 9 I'd be ok with it"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"This seasons been awesome, much more consistent in quality than 5 and in a lot of ways 4 imo, but we've been missing having a mind blowing 9.5/10 on IMDB episode... really weird to have a season without some top 10 of all time outlier. I feel like there's a weird nostalgia attached to the first couple seasons for a lot of people, sort of like what The Simpsons has had to be burdened with - where its maybe harder for R&M to be put on the same pedestal it was before even if it deserves it"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"A nod for using ""GoodBye Blue Sky"" in the episode. I wasn't expecting that at all."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Really missed a huge opportunity to make the ‚Äúsun‚Äù Sunkist orange soda üòÇ
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,its great that the characters are evolving and learning from their mistakes!
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I really liked this episode,excited for the finale new week"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Omg, this is so much character development for rick I can't wait to watch it. It's almost like rick became a transcendent for all the wrong reasons (the Central Finite Curve, hence the citadel), but now he's becoming a transcendent who is more hands off, accepting and open to understanding the process others go through."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Rick's story arc this season is interesting. 

He was humbled by Rick Prime,
Shown Ricks are not the smartest in all cases by the dinosaures
He saw the consequences of his actions with Pissman.

It's kind of interesting to see how he finally lets himself evolve as a character."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"It's also very telling that the drool is missing from Rick's mouth a lot more in recent episodes. I do enjoy his arch.

I wonder if we'll unironically see him wear his seatbelt."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This episode was great I specially loved the Pink Floyd sequence it fits so well with the theme of the episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Im worried this all will lead into Rick eventually being killed by a ""Rickier"" Rick. 

in previous episodes, he always made it well known, he was the Rickiest Rick, well now he is becoming less of that, i hope this won't lead to his demise"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I love the way doesn't lost the funny moments even when Rick is showing a better version of himself, i was afraid about that change because maybe the guys behind the 4th wall don't like the new Rick ü•∞"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,The part that I enjoy most about this episode is Rick acknowledging that he's at fault for why Morty frequently disagrees with him and is so cynical about Rick's intentions
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Ngl I really like agreeable Rick. A Rick that can blow these d bags away with a thought but recognizes that Morty needs to solve this problem himself and he can support him doing that.
Him learning restraint in some way for the sake of patching things up is really amazing."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"The fact that they used a pink floyd song  makes me so happy.
It fit so well with the episode"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I actually laughed in this new one so thats nice. Only at the end with the throwback to the acid vat, it made me think the whole scenario was fake again"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"""Shh, Morty. We're gonna make your d**k so fake, buddy.""
That's both the sweetest and funniest thing that I had ever heard. Kudos to Anne Lane for writing it."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"this entire season felt like some kind of filler or training arc to develop the characters, no major plot going on at all, but it is fun"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Oh Rick changed because he realized how Morty thinks of him when Morty disregarded his advice and took the sword. I thought it was just way too weird how Rick completely did a 180 of his character in this episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This rick change episode to me feels like it should have been a few episodes sooner for the season if not the premier because the other episodes just have him relatively the same so i genuinely couldn't' tell if he was just pulling another vat of acid thing again
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,very detailed. appreciate these for at least being detailed.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Honestly I like seeing Rick being nice and agreeable for once. He's learning from his mistakes from past. So they won't happen again.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I wonder if this Rick has multiple version of himself that is trying to be a better person. Also can‚Äôt wait for him to see Bird Person again to show him how much he‚Äôs grown, even if he is a different version."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I wanna see an interview with Jack Black and Daniel Radcliffe on this episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This probably second favorite episode of season 6.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I love this episode being a foil to vat of acid in every way
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Genuine character progression without resetting it by the end of the episode is the only way to make these long running shows last. After awhile the gimmicks become little more than dressing, we need characters to latch onto. It's why family guy sucks now"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Well, I'm on a Pink Floyd kick now. That's was a great sequence."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I get it, and it was a fun enough episode, but I swear I've seen Morty go through a similar arc several times before in this show."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Yeah , with all the talk of Rick being better wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that arcs end is Rick (main Rick) dies... permanently after a confrontation with the rickest Rick. Would blow my mind and have that emotional gut punch that‚Äôs been put on the back burner. I could imagine Rick just explaining all that darkness and pain inside himself that never went away to his family expressing truthfully how much he valued their time together , then a portal opens up with a different Rick coming from a different reality same way our main Rick has as callous and uncaring, just to begin his own unique path to self betterment."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I‚Äôve liked every episode this season- the first time I can say that since Season 2
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,The way Rick and Morty behave in this episode makes it seem like they are swapping foundational beliefs
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"–≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω –ø—Ä—è–º –ö—Ä—É—Ç–æ–π. –Ø –∑–Ω–∞—é,—á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ –∑—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç –æ–±—ã—á–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏–ª–∏ –∫–∞–Ω–æ–Ω–∞,–Ω–æ —Ç–æ,–∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞–º –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç,—á—Ç–æ –†–∏–∫ –º–µ–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è,—ç—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä—É—á–µ"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I think this episode can be interpreted as how dangerous it is for the universal balance to take lightly and mess with the beliefs of a culture to which you do not belong.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,because of the way the episode ended i thought all of rick's emotional support was just mind games for the vat of lava since morty called him boring.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I hope we get an episode that actually makes Summer a character for a change. I never enjoy her whenever she has her own episode and I‚Äôd really like to see something new done with her character for once.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Anyone else see so much of Rick‚Äôs personality in Morty this episode?
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Seeing how Rick became agreeable with Morty in that episode shows some character development. It's pretty creepy NGL. I actually prefer Rick being his old self where he didn't take therapy.

And I like how they did the Vat of Acid Episode part at the end."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This is arguably the 2nd best season of the show (after season 2)
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This is definitely the best episode this season so far
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Morty with the whiteboard feels like Rick telling Morty and Summer how little they mean to him.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Those crows really changed Rick
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"The idea that Rick, who has traveled all over the multiverse, was unaware of all these people living in the solar system seems really ridiculous"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Let them finish! symbolic castration, wow!

-‚ÄòThey were letting me finish sir‚Äô 

I know i was being sarcastic."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,This season has really been a return to greatness for Rick and morty last 3 season I think where weak
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Rick's response to not being the smartest  creature in the universe is to become *passive.*
Yeah, that tracks. No spine under that pickled brain."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Pink Floyd bit was great, really nice homage to ""The Wall"""
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I knoow this won't get read but I still want to put it out there that the fix of season 6 has saved the show from it's own demise! 
Season 4 and 5 had so many flaws in the middle and great finales, but season 6 was stable throughout! THANK YOU"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,It blew my mind when I realise that the entire episode was just a build up to another ‚ÄòVat of acid‚Äô sequel.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,‚ÄúRick has truly developed as a character huzzah the writers are so smart ü§ì‚Äù
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I like that he is trying and am curious to who this season ends
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,the vat of acid ending was so funny
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Better than last week episode.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Can't believe they didn't mention the guest voices. Mitchell and Webb?! AND Matt King?!?
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Does this mean that if Morty dies he will turn into some sort of sun flare?
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Really enjoyed these last few episodes
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,My question is how does this fit in with the US having a Mars base?
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Great episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON!!!!!
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Such a good episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Don't forget about the return of the vat reference.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Wait‚Ä¶. They‚Äôre not about to kill morty off are they, last time there was this much character progression. Bird person got shot"
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Yet yall didn‚Äôt talk about the sun being a ‚Äúvat of acid‚Äù
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Rick is a good grandpa this episode
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,ADULT SWIM JUST FREAKING RESTOCK FINAL SPACE DVDS JUST FREAKING DO IT!!!
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,All this character growth is gonna hurt come episode e 10 !
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Basically, an episode condemning circumcision, aka Male Genital Mutilation. Very nice. We need more condemnation of that publicly."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I remember when the episodes were smart and funny.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I have a running theory that this isn‚Äôt actually their Rick, but the Rick that eats his own poop."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Shocking that we would see Rick being supportive.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"I really like the character growth here across the board. I suspect the writers might get push back from some of the fans who will miss ""GOD mode hedonist Rick"", but it really does make for better writing and a longer lasting more intriguing story. The main stream depictions of 'Geniuses' always feel 2D and inconsistent because of the lack of growth. Like the characters on something like the ""Big Bang"" theory are smart enough to be tenured college professors and go to space, but some how ALSO TOO dumb to realize that a 'bowl cut' combined with an outfit from the 70's are a bad look that will give off a bad impression and hamstring them in every aspect of their lives involving other people?

House is a medical genius who by sheer virtue of being a doctor has SURELY encountered basic ethics as they apply to practicing medicine but constantly makes rash dangerous decisions regarding his patients and personal affairs. All these depictions of HIGH IQ tortured geniuses who are simultaneously too dumb or arrogant to consult a specialist or practice BASIC mental health and self care/improvement.

Like PATTERN RECOGNITION is the main evolutionary advantage of being intelligent. Even IF that pattern is your own self destructive habits."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,"Unlike other episodes in this season, I really feel like the first third.. almost half? of this episode was really weak. The weird stand off between rick and morty in the garage just felt awkward, it's like the animators didn't even understand what the show wanted them to animate.

The second half was fun tho. I liked seeing morty yet again try to pass off as rick and utterly fail (explaining the sun)
And the vat of acid.. I mean the vat of sun... I loved that. it was actually super genuine."
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,1:36 this scene without context is odd
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Can‚Äôt believe they passed up on Mort of the crimson Rick
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,I loved the callback to the vat of acid.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,You did the impossible guys. You did a war montage while playing Goodbye Blue Sky by my favorite band Pink Floyd. and make it look awesome.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Rick and Morty with Super Hans in it has to be the best birthday present ill ever receive. I hope it introduces Peep Show to a wider audience. Im thrilled to bits that Roiland is obviously a fan.
1,cAdNwwze0Bs,Therapy really seems to be helping Rick huh?

1,Z6qFfubjXw0,"Quando eu vi o gorila, automaticamente fui transportado para a Rede Record, quando passava aquela s√©rie transformes (Beast Wars) que era junto com o Max Steel e outros desenhos, eu pensava que esse filme ia ser na pegada dos beats wars, mas vai ser diferente."

1,Z6qFfubjXw0,"Por muito tempo sempre achei q a s√©rie Transformers era com animais por conta de Beast Wars, nunca que passou pela minha cabe√ßa que era carro e caminh√£o kkkk lembro que achei at√© tosco quando descobri, olha n√£o acompanho essa s√©rie de filmes desde o terceiro, cansei, mas esse eu vou e com gosto"
1,Z6qFfubjXw0,Trailer da incr√≠vel cgi t√° um pouquinho estranho e a arcee t√° muito diferente n√£o gostei muito desse visual mas o espelho est√° bacana ainda mais um  Optimus Primal
1,Z6qFfubjXw0,"Esse eu assisto no cinema, s√≥ por causa dos Beast Wars."
1,Z6qFfubjXw0,Finalmente ap√≥s acho ap√≥s 4 anos essa franquia vai voltar com tudo! Estou animado demais pra volta de robos lutando e sem muitas mulheres se s**ualizando maravilha e ainda animais robos vai ser incrivel mano!

1,Z6qFfubjXw0,Paramount lan√ßou a braba
1,Z6qFfubjXw0,"Esse ""reboot"" da s√©rie t√° sendo a melhor coisa, Michael Bay fora do projeto foi a melhor decis√£o, (ainda mais depois do planeta Terra ser o Unicron no √öltimo Cavaleiro... Piada pronta)."
1,Z6qFfubjXw0,Terminei de ver o trailer fiquei olhando pro meu carro pra ver se ele se transformava

1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"This, personally, is a great example of a short but creepy story. Having Let's Read as the narrator gives off a gloomy atmosphere. The feeling this video emits is uneasy and frightening that the jump scares don't seem cheap. It all has this foreboding uncertainty. For me, one of the better videos Wansee's release."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Listening to horror stories in the winter while drinking hot cocoa and watching the snow fall from the sky hits different üíï
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Can I just say I love the guy narrating the story voice it just so relaxing. The minute the sun goes down I try not to be out at night because you just never know what's or who outside at night. Thank you for sharing another scary story and keep up with the awesome work.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,This narrator's voice is soo soothing and also gives goosebumps & chilling vibes .was Missing his narration. Would love to hear more from him.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Nothing is more scary than Watching this 5:05 in the morning and still dark
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,WANSEE YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME PROUD. This one gave my chills and I was watching this in broad daylight üò® keep up the great work buddy
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Loving this new Wannsee story, as this is an common to as where the guy would be under the lights and when the lights flick he is gone."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,big fan love your content finished watching your entire compilation playlist about to finish your horror stories 602/702
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"So I'm from India, and Wansee uploads a video around 23:00 IST. This is something I definitely look forward to every night before going to bed ü§ç"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Tbh, this wasn't a scary story. What seems to have happened is that some guy (possibly drunk) just waved at OP, but since he didn't get a wave back, he just did a silly dance to mess around. 

OP probs just got scared, but I highly doubt the guy was actually going to break in."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"I would've booked it like a bat out of hell if I was in that situation, outside that is. If not made sure all my doors and windows were locked if I was at home."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Oh yeah. Wansee has got some talent for plenty of years!
*Me & Wansee‚Äôs fans:* ""Your DREAMS never get old bro. Keep it up!!!‚Äù"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Still the best wansee's story is the comfort zone that you need like whenever your sad or happy either as excited it's just the best ü§çü§ç
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Love the vibes the story has,  the background night sky, stars, street lights &  chilling in cold winter alone living in an  apartment and a perfectly made mysterious occurrence. The vibes given are amazing üí´. Please never forget these kind of stories ü•∫  vibes are unmatchable"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,It's really good just like the rest I love the horror stories
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Wansee never fails
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Brilliant video, brilliant animation. (:"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,The video is a masterpiece!üí´ü•∫üëçüèª want more of these
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Wansee‚Äôs stories be the most entertaining scary animations on YouTube, along with Horror Shorts Party"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Another amazing horror story from wansee keep it up.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Wansee entertainment never fails to entertain us!!!!
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,I never want to meet this man in real life!!! Thank you for this story Wansee
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,i miss watching this channel because of school but now im glad we have holidayd so i can watch like 90 episode's of wansee
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,You never know who or what is outside at night.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,‚Äú He‚Äôs just standing there‚Ä¶ MENACINGLY!!‚Äù
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Now that‚Äôs some nice creepypasta
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"The guy was probably nice, And then this girl thinks that this guy is dangerous, poor guy just running down the street."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"I don't see what's so creepy about a guy running on a street, coming to a stop, waving at you, dancing in a weird way and then continue running again. Is it just me?"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Keep this up, Wansee!"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,I always enjoy watching and listening to Wansee Entertainment
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,That guy wasn't creepy.  He was just funny.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,That guy was just stretching because he was exercising.  It seemed to her that he was waving at her.  Good story and animation.  I liked the way she went inside and secured everything and drew the curtains.  That's what I would've done.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,this gave me the chills!!! 
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"Bro just wanted a little dancing break from running, no need to judge üòÇ"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"I thought this was a Mort horror story because of the narrator had to double check the channel because the animation style is wansee, got confused for a while üòÇ"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"It's one of the stories that could have been done better. It wasn't creepy. At least, I thought, that the narrator would find out about some robbery/murder or some hint of something supernatural to affirm her sense of unease. But that did not happen. I mean, the build up did not lead to anything of consequence. So it felt very dry."
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Amazing video been watching since 2019!
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,that last part scared the hell out of me
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Awesome job these are favorite things to watch
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"This female is a bit naive in the story, cause see me I'm the type of person it only takes three cars passing by my apartment while I'm outside, and I'm already paranoid and ready to go in üò®"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,The end scared me üò®
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,I want to make a story called. *The little girl in my backyard* I feel that will be very cool.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,I don't think that's creepy. Perhaps he was somewhat drunk or feeling lost. I'd wave at someone too if I feel lonely and lost in my life. Whatever it is I feel pity for him
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Her balcony sounds so comfortable lol.. beside the story..
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,ALREADY SENT YOU A TRUE HORROR STORY AND I CAN SAY MY STORY IS WAY MUCH CREEPIER THAN THIS.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,You know what I don't know why but you're going to tell you this because I kind of got creeped out myself so about I saw a man he was really tall his arms were really really long like super long from average human he was like a like black dark shadow and he passed by a jewelry store one time I saw him through my window  the kitchen window and when he turned to a corner and it looked like he disappeared it and he was like really long. And here's another one I was at my aunt's house and I saw my cousin she was standing in front of my aunt's room and her husband she look like a really dark black shadow too and I know because she is actually tall not really tall but she is tall and after that she just stood there enough that I didn't think any of it but then I realized like my Aunt has like a little like a night light in the living room so I was thinking nothing of it but then I was like wondering why did I not see her face or the back of her if there was a little bit of light and the light actually was like actually bright like it didn't break the whole room but but the stairs and you can like see around yourself a little I didn't see anything she's looking so black shadow and she just stood still in front of my aunts and her husband's room it was creepy but but that day I never thought anything of it so I just fell asleep and now I'm thinking of it there was a little bit of light like a night lights I don't know why I didn't see her back or her face I'm just telling you this I don't know because you like the greatest stories are really like interesting and I got to get scared but yeah I don't know I'm just saying
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Wansee never fails
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,This story feels similar to the dancing man
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,"When I was watching this video I thought it was just going to be a typical ""Weirdo/Stalker"" video that was creepy but not exactly scary... and then that ""What-If"" ending popped up! 
Well played. 

(P.S. Still waiting for *My Friend is Camping Alone, His Texts are Starting to Scare Me Part 3* btw)"
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,I first thought that he was drunken üòÇ.
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,A true story with an unrealistic ending
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,i watch your videos everytime you upload i love your videos
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,thats a really creepy experience
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Did you really have to make him an alien in the end? üôÑ
1,nJ3CjPwUAhs,Every night I would make sure everything is locked up and wouldn't be out at night at all or I would try to stay at someone house that's scary.‚òÉÔ∏èüôè‚òÉÔ∏è

There‚Äôs a store near me that sells a bunch of old trading cards, and they have this huge box of garbage pail kids cards! They‚Äôre all opened already, but that‚Äôs ok. I only have about 20 though because they‚Äôre really expensive for $1 per card!! Anyways, I was super excited for this video and you also inspired me to create my very first flipbooks! You are awesome man"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"I was a schoolteacher; I remember all the pearl-clutching over those Garbage Pail cards.  People were positively howling over how awful they were!  If kids got caught with the things at school, they were confiscated.  LOL  
I have to admit that (though I couldn't let on!) I found most of the cards absolutely hysterical and subversively witty.üòù"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Oh! so sad the artwork of the 2 cards are missing, but this video is so cool and creative!! Love the ‚Äúnew‚Äù cards"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Me: I refuse to watch YouTube clickbait titles!

Also me: whoa, Andy! What a wacky title! What is this rapscallion up to now!? Can't wait to watch!"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,My son loves your videos and even started making his own flipbooks. It was great to watch you bond with your kids while opening all the cards. great video
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,I thought that Flip Book was illegal cause it  had something like super Gorey content or lots of NSFW content that they are selling to children but it's a Counterfeit which still bad but overall i still think it's overpriced.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Wow, one must really love flipbooks to pay $712- to get one. On the flipside (pun intended), it's something superrare that will be treasured for sure."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,My guy Andy is just having fun with life. Take notes world.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Damn, for all your work on this video. I commend you. That's crazy. Good work."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"It's been a year, here we go again

Also, this video was really entertaining, good work! I saw you had a different editting style here, too."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Thanks! Any idea when the flip book starter kits are going to be back in stock? It's one of the main things my kids want for Christmas, and I'm hoping they'll be back in stock soon! I would much rather support you than some random seller on Amazon."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"I just simply LOVE Garbage Pail Kids!
At least you got all of the cards!"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Aww I love how ur kids are helping you with the cards ü§óü§ó
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Dealer: Ummm sir it's illegal....
Him: O - ok- 
Dealer: What the üíÄ"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,You know he's dedicated when he risks going to jail for them.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,This is cool. And you got your hands on it? That's coooool :)
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Wow Andy never thought you would pay 700 bucks for some counterfeit cardsüòÇ‚ù§
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,That was one of the best sponsorships in a video I‚Äôve seen in a while.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,After the video: sir your under arrest for having a counterfeit filpbook and we have to put about 7 years in jail
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,This reminds me of illegal Lego building techniques
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Man I wish my dad was this cool.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Any idea when your flip book kits will restock? My son loves your videos and I wanted to get one for him for Christmas. ‚ù§
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Loved seeing your kids geek out with you over the GPK cards. I loved getting cards as a kid back in the 80‚Äôs. It‚Äôs always fun seeing you go through the cards in these videos. 

I put a crash pad for you to land on. Hope you‚Äôre safe. üòÇ"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,I remember collecting Garbage Pail Kids cards when I was a kid.  I have seen some for sale lately and I was blown away at the prices.  Makes me wish I still had mine.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Andy: jumps out a plane and doesn‚Äôt care bc he is editing*

Me: Dead on the floor from laughing to hardüòÇ

Love your videos andy‚ù§ It was fun watching your kids geek out over GPK cards! Keep up the good work!"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"My dad used to have hundreds of garbage pail kids cards. I still have them, in a box."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Thanks so muchüòä you inspired me to like garbage pail kids
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,When it said buffering and started loading I got an advertisementüòÇ
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,This is amazing keep it up!
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Very cool video. I didn't notice any gaps when the flip book was played on video, so maybe the two missing cards/numbers are actually non-existent and the cards/sets were mis-numbered. It's great to see your family get involved."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"When you said that you left your GPS coordination‚Äòs I thought that you were just keep  until I check the comment section and you weren‚Äôt kidding

And while you‚Äôre at it close your hands and throw them back and forth everybody üòÖ"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Hey! Haven't seen you in a while! Thought you quit. üíÄ






Obvious joke alert after the obvious joke"

1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Andymation are you going to do another flip fest?
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"enjoy your videos. they always felt like the lighter side of YouTube. but an ad about jumping out of a plane felt a little too much, and maybe a little in poor taste. i hope we don't start normalizing those kinds of jokes."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Can you make a video unboxing the cards and showing them to the camera
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,this video was really cool and all those cards are sick and the whole backstory of them is really intereting but.....BRO WHAT HAPPEND TO UR FINGER :O
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Cool flip book!
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"When I saw this video I thought it was made 1 month ago and when I saw it , it was 15 minutes ago"

1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se que no va a suceder, pero me encantar√≠a que tuvieran los actores de doblaje latino del juego, porque me enamore de la voz de Joel y Ellie"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Los gamers tuvimos la oportunidad de disfrutar esta pedazo de historia brutal, y me parece perfecto que ahora las personas que no juegan a videojuegos puedan disfrutarla de otro modo. Ojal√° guste a ambas partes, pero no olvidemos que esta es una versi√≥n m√°s dirigida a quienes no jugaron el juego, diferencias habr√° desde luego, pero se ve espectacular üíú"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Ojal√° pongan esa m√∫sica de fondo cuando Joel rescat√≥ a Ellie del hospital. Ojal√° imiten esa escena, es tan genial y emotiva."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"HBO suele hacer buenas series, confi√≥ en que sera un exito¬° (y aparte esta Oberyn Nymeros-Martel y la Osita Mormont"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se ve incre√≠ble!! Pedro Pascal nuevamente genial y que bueno ver nuevamente a Anna Torv, era tremenda en Fringe y Mindhunter, as√≠ como al Joel del juego, Troy Baker. Y ojal√° usen nuevamente la banda sonora del maestro Santaolalla!"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"No conozco mucho a Pedro Pascal pero el trabajo que hizo en Game of Thrones fue magn√≠fico, ya espero con ansias est√° adaptaci√≥n."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Tuve la oportunidad de terminarme los dos juegos. La historia y los personajes me encantan 10/10
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Okay, todos estamos de acuerdo que la actriz de Ellie no se parece a la del videojuego, pero en su actitud, su forma de hablar y las bromas que hace, se siente totalmente como Ellie.
Le tengo mucha f√© a esta serie, se ve espectacular."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Amo the Last of us desde que lo jugu√© hasta hacerlo platino y ver una serie que mucha gente que no jug√≥ el juego la podr√°n disfrutar. Ser√° una felicidad que se comparta esta incre√≠ble historia en forma de serie
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Si esto resulta un √©xito, HBO har√° m√°s adaptaciones Live-Action de series o pel√≠culas.
Resident Evil ya deber√≠a tener una 4ta adaptaci√≥n, pero a cargo de esta empresa."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,HBO nunca decepciona
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,espero que estrene gracias HBO por traernos esta serie que sin duda ser√° esepcional .
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"HBO siempre haces todo bien , y eso incluye a elegir buenos doblajes, por favor, que la voz de Pedro Pascal sea la misma que le diste en juego de tronos en latino, la del actor de doblaje Jos√© Gilberto vilchis, quedar√≠a √©pico!"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se ve √©pico, ya agrego esta serie a mi lista ‚ô•"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"No ten√≠a expectativas de esta serie pero a lo que veo el Tr√°iler promete mucho y me di cuenta de varias escenas que pudimos apreciar en el.primer juego ser√°n recreadas y eso me encanta, lo √∫nico malo es que la actriz de Ellie no se parece en nada a Ellie cuando pudieron haber contestado a su actriz de voz o incluso a otras celebridad que se parecen m√°s pero bueno a lo que veo le ech√≥ ganas y la serie promete en su historia y mundo"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Tuve la oportunidad de disfrutar este gran videojuego con un desarrollo de la historia espectacular y me parece perfecto el hecho de que pudieran plasmar est√° maravilla en una serie. 
Deseo que a todos los que lo jugamos ambas partes nos encanten, estoy consiente que ir√° dirigida al p√∫blico general , pero se que la esencia principal de esta historia quedar√° plasmada."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"literalmente me emocione viendo este trailer, espero que sea la mejor serie porque tiene la re pinta!"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"alguien sabe si habra una parte 3 del juego? que juego impresionante, ojala la serie sea el 10%"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,El a√±o que viene 2023 seguramente va a ser un gran a√±o. Miramos avances de estrenos que llegaran. Aparte mirar los detalles de este trailer se re nota que es muy Leal al Videojuego que es estupendo üòÑ
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"casualmente estoy jugando la parte 2. es un juego extremadamente bueno con una historia y personajes bien desarrollados, es otro nivel."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Me muero por ver esta serie... Me enamore del juego, es uno de mis juegos favoritos y tengo grandes expectativas con esta serie"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"La ambientaci√≥n se ve incre√≠ble, Joel se ve muy bien pero Ellie sigue sin convencerme.
Espero que el d√≠a que salga termine diciendo que Ellie me encant√≥ porque este juego me parece una obra maestra, lo jugu√© en Ps3, el Remaster de PS4 y ahora el Remake de PS5 y espero de verdad poder decir que la serie te transmite eso que te transmite el juego durante toda la aventura y sobre todo, el final que es incre√≠ble. Tengo mucha fe e  esta serie."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"No voy a mentirles, esto se ve maravilloso"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se ve una serie muy prometedora bajo la direcci√≥n de Craig Mazin. Sorprendido por la aparici√≥n de Anna Torv, quien en Secret City (serie australiana) estuvo muy bien."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Lo siento pero de verdad estoy llorando es el mejor trailer m√°s la canci√≥n take on me es simplemente perfecto ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"si va ser fiel al juego no veo la hora de ver cuando Joe entra al hospital solo y el momento en que se lleva a Ellie, de solo pensarlo se me pone la piel de gallina"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Este juego tuve la fortuna de comprarlo y jugarlo cuando recien salio y recuerdo mis amigos con los que intercambiaba games no les gustaba y yo les decia que hasta deberian hacer una pelicula de un game asi y ahora el tiempo me dio la razon üòä
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,HBO eres Grande no como otros üôåüèª eres perfecto ya espero ver pronto me encanta
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Ojal√° sea un pedazo de serieüî•
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Amo que a√±adan partes que no sucedieron en el juego, c√≥mo modo de explicar mejor algunas cosas que no se rigen a la historia del juego, ya que no todo va a estar en el juego, tambi√©n me encanta que pusieran ""take on me"" de fondo haciendo referencia al cover de ellie en la 2da parte"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Por favor contraten a las voces en latino del videojuego POR FAVOOOOOR!
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se ve espectacular, no conozco el juego pero la serie la ver√©, tiene buena pinta"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"HBO tienes buen material, los actores me me gustan en su mayor√≠a, por favor sorprendeme con esta joya de historia"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Tuve la suerte de jugae los dos juegos y mi hermana es fan de las series de zombies empez√≥ a verme jugar porque le gustaba que sea de infectados y cuando le coment√© que sal√≠a una serie se emocione igual que yo
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Solo espero que las voces sean las de los mismos actores del juego, quedaria perfecto"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Quiero llorar, yo lloro cada vez que termino el juego, lo he pasado unas 3 veces.
Los actores no me gustan, f√≠sicamente no los relaciono con  los del juego, pero la producci√≥n se ve muy bien, esperemos que este bueno el desarrollo."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,uffff yo lo jugue a este juegazo 30 veces y no me canso y que saquen una serie es incre√≠ble
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,esto va a estar brutalisimo man TE AMO HBO MAX
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Estoy ansioso por ver a la genial Bella Ramsey y a mi compatriota Pedro Pascal en esta adaptaci√≥n de mi videojuego favorito.
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,La verdad que ser√° una gran cerie sin duda se ve esepcional y que dicha que ahora podamos ver a ellie y Joel fuera del v√≠deo juego con esta serie ya quiero verla en verdad espero que estrene gracias HBO por traernos esta serie que sin duda ser√° esepcional .
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Aqu√≠ la prueba que sew pueden adaptar historias de videojuegos, si los que se encargan de hacerla aman la historia y ven un futuro en ella esto es realmente un poema para los fans, a esperar que hace amazon prime con god of war"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,incre√≠ble historia en forma de serie
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Usar Take on me como soundtrack de este trailer sabiendo que hace un par de a√±itos Ellie le canta esta canci√≥n a Dina es alta referencia!
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Justo en el dia de mi cumplea√±os üòáüí™
Lo voy a diafrutar a lo grande esta peli üò±"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"No creo estar preparado para la escena final de Henry y Sam en este live action :c, el que interpreta a Sam se ve mas peque√±o que el del videojuego ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se ve cool y tiene las parte que estan en el juego como joel escapando con tommy y sarah de los infectado y conociendo a henry y sam y el dlc de ellie con su amiga riley
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Esper√°ndola con ansias, uno de los mejores estrenos del 2023."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Se ve increible, se ven muchos personajes secundarios del juego. La ambientaci√≥n y fotograf√≠a se ve brutal. A Pedro Pascal le pegan estos papeles :D"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Nunca me va a gustar el cast de Ellie, pero Pedro Pascal como Joel me encanta. Con todo el hype!! pinta muy buena la serie."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW, pero que nivel carajo!!, la verdad yo no juegue los videojuegos y me paso por las pelotas a todos los haters que dicen: ''Es que tiene inclusi√≥n forzada y no se parecen los actores''. Lo que importa es la maldita escritura, las malditas actuaciones y la creaci√≥n de momentos... HBO y Apple son las que mejor calidad tienen en sus series originales, y nadie me baja de ah√≠!!!."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Esto se ve incre√≠ble por todos lados, los sets, los dialogos, todos los personajes (exceptuando a Ellie que no se parece jajaja pero bueno) Solido 10"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Que buena pinta tiene, mucha fidelidad al videojuego apriori y se agradece."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se viene otra buena adaptaci√≥n de videojuegos üëèüëè
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Ojal√° de intro en la serie sea el tema principal mostrando im√°genes de las casa y edificios abandonados llenandose de humedad y hongos o as√≠ como el intro del juego
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,POR FIN MI JUEGO DE ZOMBIES FAVORITO TENDRA UNA SERIE üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Tal vez debieron buscar ah una actriz m√°s parec√≠a ah ellie pero a√∫n as√≠ creo que ser√° una gran serie
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Dios est√° todo, bill, tommy, marlene, henry, ojala tambi√©n en esta serie tengan en cuenta el segundo juego, y este jesse, dina, abby, owen, etc, tlou siempre fue mi juego favorito, lo adoro, y esta adaptaci√≥n me parece que va a ser muy fiel al juego original, lo √∫nico que no me qued√≥ muy a gusto es con la actriz de ellie, se ve como de 10 a√±os y ellie tiene 14,pero bueno, esperemos al 15 de enero"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Escenas del videojuego que conozco :

0:04 = Cuando Joel , Tess llevan a Ellie al Capitolio para entregar a las Luci√©rnagas

0:16 = Joel y Sarah tratan de escapar de los Zombies 

0:35 = Cuando Ellie les muestra que ella est√° infectada

0:49 = Ac√° es cuando inicia el The last of Us : DLC left Behind (la mejor amiga de Ellie (Riley) le lleva al centro del comercial antes de que se vaya a una misi√≥n)

0:56 = cuando Joel pone una tabla para cruzar del otro lado y antes de llegar al capitolio

1:35 = M√°s escenas del The Last of Us : DLC left Behind

1:37 = Cuando Joel va a pedir ayuda a Bill (el de las trampas)

1:39 = Henry Y Sam üò¢

1:42 = escena inicial del juego cuando Tommy y Joel tratan de escapar de la ciudad cuando comienza todo el Apocalipsis

1:48 = cuando Ellie escapa tras descubrir que David sabe que hay recompensa por Joel y la ni√±a

1:52 = Cuando Ellie va a morder a David

1:56 = Joel encuentra a ellie tras ver que ella mato a David

2:05 = Gordoinflones (que miedo me da cuando lo veo üòü)"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Todo gamer que se respeta est√° ansioso por ver est√° serie üëåüèªüòé
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"gente no se esperen que sea leal al 100% al juego por favor esta serie la van a implementar a su estilo por lo que abra muchas diferencias a pesar de que esten los ""mismos personajes"" del juego, solo quiero que disfruten esta serie y no la combiertan en otra serie que fracase por que somos exquisitos. Que tengan buen dia"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se ve incre√≠ble üò≥
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,El Hype es real

1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Nunca he jugado a este juego porque no tengo la ps ;_;
Pero de como la gente habla de el me espero una gran serie, ademas a mi Pedro Pascal me encanta. Ojala no desepcione los fan del juego üôè"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Ahora si va a dar un buen impacto la parte de henry y sam
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Es increible leer a personas, probablemente adultas, ofendiendo a una adolescente por su apariencia f√≠sica. Es cierto que no se parece a Ellie, pero una cosa es eso y otra son los insultos, eso es maldad"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"El juego no lo pude jugar pero vi su historia y me encanto el uno el dos no tanto. y aca los actores que eligieron no me gustaron mucho, desde que se hablaba de su salida hubieron muchas imagenes de posibles actores que se parecian mas y te daba  la sensacion ve estar viendo a Joel y Ellie."
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Estoy muy ansioso ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Espero que tenga un buen Doblaje..ojal√° se conserven las voces originales del juego

1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Cuando tuvimos una PS4 todos sol√≠amos jugar a ese juego de la d√©cada del 2010, pero ahora s√≠ HBO Max se estrenar√° su propia serie"
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se ve prometedor! Creo que cumpliran con las expectativas
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se ve espectacular.
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Espero que en el doblaje sean las mismas voces del juego üò£ü§û

1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,Se viene la mejor serie de 2023!
1,e-bX8JX3Kf0,"Uff esto pinta mucho mejor que lo anterior mostrado, creo que vamos a llorar tanto o mas que con el juego, aun as√≠ Ellie no me convence, espero equivocarme en esto ultimo."

2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Which performed best? VOTE BELOW!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"For timeless looks, I‚Äôd say the Range Rover. But for off-road/ outdoor looks, that goes to the defender."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Next time please do another down hill run with all the right settings for both cars, like you always do with drag races when there was an error on the first runüòÅ"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Really cool off road head-to-head. Really want the Hummer EV and Rivian to go head-to-head on this course and see how much range is left after doing some off-roading. Thank you carwow.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Wow! Another awesome challenge to watch. I totally think the Defender should have won since it's mainly built for off-road hustle than a Range Rover that sways between luxury and off-road! All in all, it was so lovely to watch and thanks a lot guys for sharing an amazing challenge!!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"A suggestion for a way to set up the scoring system, how about each cars start at the maximum amout of points for all the challenges and the aim is to work their way down so that by the end of it all we can easily tell which car did everything flawlessly(assuming a car had no points at the end of it all) and that way we can compare it to other cars that weren't in the same video as lower points are easier to remember than higher ones cause we dont know what the upper limit is. Cheers!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Darren's knowledge of what the different modes do to the car is so interesting, never knew about all that. Where is that information?"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Sounds effect when Darren moves should always be included from now on! Brilliant! LOL
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Love the off-road testsüòÅ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,At this point Mat is just having fun in cars.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I would love to choose both because it's great for both rovers
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Don‚Äôt we all love a daily dose of watching carwow?‚ù§Ô∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,We need a drag race of these 2. Or a Sport SVR vs the new twin turbo V8 Sport.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Having had Range Rovers for 11 years, I decided to order a Defender P400 90 in 2021.  After waiting 9 months and running it for six months, the conclusion: it ain‚Äôt a Range Rover!  Sold it; bought a Range Rover‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.best car in the world!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"You *DO* get instant torque with a supercharger, more so than with a turbo. Nick was just sleeping at the wheel the whole video."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Even thought I‚Äôm not a Jaguar-Land Rover person, I‚Äôd still go with the Defender overall when it comes to off-roading. It just has that off-road look and capability to it. The Range Rover is just too luxurious to off-road imo ~"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Would love to see how the Evoque compares the full size Range Rover on this course
I think the results could be surprising with the Evoque short wheelbase and lighter weight"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Thanks for this amazing offroad battle, Carwow!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,In case you‚Äôre wondering about that scraping noise when the defender went down the slope on the axle twist it was just the mud guard scraping the dirt
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,These are the insane off-road challenges we love!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"So happy you did this comparison, makes sense if you going to buy a reputable 4x4. However sorry Matt, it was the Defender!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Those two cars are just awesome in the offroad even with the low profile tyres..
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I would say, Defender is a real Defender for off road challenges."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I am yet to finish the video but I am already unhappy about not re doing the down hill challenge. I don't understand matt's obsession to win. We are not here to see you win or boost your ego but to honestly understand the vehicles being compared.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Darren seems like a good dude
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,This is the best off-road challenge to compare turbochargers and superchargers when it comes to torque!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You guys are most welcome!! Was great to see how you guys do it! So much effort!! Stephen
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Awesome, that's comparison we all want, loved it‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You should do a video where Darren drives and shows you his skills üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Been Waiting for this ! Being from a country where I can apply these cars and my love for elegance, I choose Range Rover. However, not much difference between them."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Vote Matt Watson! Love to see him go up and down the hill üòÖ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Finally an actual fair comparison. The only thing that can challenge a Land Rover is a Range Rover. üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,It's ironic that the most seemingly off-road capable SUVs are the most likely to leave you broken down in a remote place. Fun video though!!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Darren really knows what he's doing.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I think both are equally winning. But I never knew that Mud ruts keeps wheels better on ground than Rock crawl mode where wheels move individually. Damn that Terrain response system. All Land Rovers are computers on wheels, besides that they doesn't solve maths."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"It hurts to see the Range Rover lose on any of the obstacles. And more so when it‚Äôs damaged in any way! But, seeing Matt lose, üòä my day is made. Good day everyone."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"The tests that were done incorrectly with the Defender should've been done again, we need to see the full capabilities of both cars when used properly, and not when drivers select the wrong modes"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"HEY MATT. (FORGIVE THE ALL CAPS)  BUT, KINDLY DO MORE OF THIS OFF-ROAD VIDEOS. THEY ARE VERY INTERACTIVE AND  INTERESTING."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Would love to know what the repair bill for the range rover is.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Finally!! A evenly match for this brand üëçüëç good job carwowüëçüëç
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I would like to see the Cayenne go through this challenge
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"So in essense, to compare these two cars this whole video has to be redone with Darren driving both, as it seems the main deciding difference is the driver knowing which button to push in which scenario..."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Defender. The hill descent and one before the last challenge should have been draws/wins giving it the win. Drive modes aren't the cars fault üòã
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both my favorite üî•üî•üòçfor off-road defender and luxurious range rover üòç
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Carwow reviews, drag races, off-road challenges and videos make me go crazy!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Finally!!! We need this with the RR sports v8 as well üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"The defender won, the second obstacle was a fault from the driver."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Defender came away with no bodywork damage so that's the winner for me.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Why does a ‚Äúcharity‚Äù need a 140k range rover???
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I wonder how well my P38 would do against these..? Only one way to find out Matt... :)
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"These are the two vehicles, every mechanic will tell you to stay away from."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I love both of the car, but i think Range Rover is over all packageüì¶ love from IndiaüáÆüá≥"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I won‚Äôt tear my hair out when I‚Äôd scratch a plastic door part in the Defender. üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Hi Mat Loved your content Love from India ‚ú®üî•
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,that exactly why we love and prefer the land cruiser over  the range rover or the defender üòÅ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both of these are fantastic looking cars but the defender for me all day ‚ù§Ô∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Could you possibly do Ford Explorer PHEV vs Defender? unlike most, I do love the Defender, but a vertically opening tail gate is a total dealbreaker for me."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Let's face it - most Land Rovers and Range Rovers will NEVER go off road. So they're both the same. As Darren said ""this is that in a dinner suit"""
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I was really hoping the land rover would win but i guess it is what it is.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Well the Flagship is just as off-road capable, but probably handles better on pavement because of rear-wheel steering, and is way more luxurious. 
I guess it's called the FLAGSHIP for a reason."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,If that range rover had it in mud and ruts it never would of got damage
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"People buy range rover for street use only, even though it is a very capable off roader. I will definitely give it to the big range rover."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"If i have all the money in the world, i would buy range rover. My love for range rover never been compromised.. Period."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You never seem to disappoint
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Look at the fear in mats eyes when he bombed out that is an expensive fail
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,The Defender doesn‚Äôt look rugged enough and if it can‚Äôt beat the Range Rover then what is the point of it. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"1:51 You know superchargers, historically famous for having no low end torque lol.
I think the producers need to have a chat with Matt how forced induction works."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"More and more often its coming down to driver error (or ability) its making these tests completely worthless. Such a shame,oh well, there are plenty of other YouTube channels to switch to."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,It was the Range rover I loved the most üî•üî•
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,3:43 üòÇTHAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME üòÇüòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Who thinks Nick deserves a permanent position on Carwow?
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Defender should win. The smooth tracks in the comparison don't let the Defender shine. Conditions that challenge approach and departure would show a different picture. Some decent tires would make both of them more capable. I've offroaded in a convoy with a stock defender (but with better tires), and it handled some very challenging terrain (obstacles rated red on a green/blue/red scale). It is shockingly capable. The Range Rover appears much wider, which also makes a big difference on many trails in our area."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"So essentially no difference/nothing special between the defender and the range rover... so much for it being ""the defender"" with even less ground clearance than the luxury range rover.... more like discovery than true proper off-roader to me.... Btw, do an off-road battle with the new Jeep Wrangler Rubicon as well! That's the last of the proper off-roaders left in Europe."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Wow, India really make good cars. Bravo! Love from Japan."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I love the Defender so much ‚ù§
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both got the same electronics. One has a german engine and the other has british one.Will pick the defender out of these two.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Defender vs Ranger Rover vs Discovery ... Now that's what I'd love to see.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Neither of these are proper off roaders.  Because of their independent suspension and road bias, they wont have the same wheel articulation as an off roader with a solid axle.  Ineos was set up to plug this market gap with the Grenadier after it saw Land Rover abandoning the serious off roader market.  

Check out some overlanding videos on youtube to see some serious offroading.  Some of the terrain the cars traverse is astonishing, definitely not doable in these two cars."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"The defender marketed more offroad capable should have clearly won, therefore the Range Rover is the clear winner."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"1 got damaged during this test, 1 did not. The 1 that did not get damaged wins it for me."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I like how Defender looks!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both are beast üî• also favourite üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Absolutely loove these tbh, alot more exciting and interesting than the regular drag strip comparisons considering there are more variables"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Doesn't matter they'll both spend most time in the garage getting fixed.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,So if I understand correct; it was a tie w/2 cases of user error on the Defender‚Äôs part?
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I‚Äôd give it to the defender
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"4:50

You should have gone one more time. That's NOT FAIR."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"If I was driving through the jungle, I'd still prefer to be in a landrover from the 70's than I would a modern one. I'd still prefer to be in a modern Toyota than a Landrover if I was driving in the jungle, the desert, the mountains etc."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Best of the best, loved it"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"It is like a battle in between AbramsX üá∫üá∏ vs T14 Armata üá∑üá∫ 

Both are phenomenal!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Interesting to see a charity/ charity exec owning a c140k car‚Ä¶ not sure I would brag about that! I certainly won‚Äôt donate given they have that!!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Range rover one of best cars in offroading.
Carwow best car reviewer on youtube.
Like if agree ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Any self-drive hire van could do these at speed‚Ä¶..
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Definitely gonna donate to a charity that needs 100k range rovers üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Best off road ever great challenge
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Finally a Land vs Range Rover Video üòä‚ù§üéâ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Hi Carwow. I know this is a bit nerdy but the defender is on a different chassis to the New Range Rover. I just wanted to correct Daren. Sorry
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Would they have been better off just keeping it in Auto? Rather than keep cocking up the modes
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Well that's the definition of elegance.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I can see Yanni smiling and waiting with the bill to fix the Rover

2,bsbnGeT9ies,It‚Äôs crazy to see a guy I followed 4 years ago go from what looked like doing work in his garage to this huge come up with the mansion. Congratulations dude!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"As someone who recently bought their first house thinking it was 100% move in ready....and immediately realized how many projects I wanted/needed to do, this house looks like a massive undertaking but honestly please show us as much as possible. I would love to see everything you do to this place."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"The steel telecom thing in your backyard is a HAM radio antenna- probably has a huge deep concrete base to anchor it in place. The little room next to your editing station with the custom shelves was the ""HAM shack"" that held all the guy's radios and gear that people collect over the years."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"I know most folks come to your channel for car content, but I'm looking forward to watching this unfold. Put the gym in the 2nd house near the sauna, use that shed for lawn and maybe pool stuff. Paint the green in the kitchen white and send the cabinet doors out to be refinished white and paint the frames yourself with the same color. Have fun. Take your time. Invest in tools as you work on things."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"One of the coolest houses on YouTube 
So glad to see how far tavarish has come and how all his hard work is paying off.
Can‚Äôt wait to see the content of the house and upcoming stuff 
It‚Äôs always cool to see him excited about something new"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"You‚Äôve got allot going on all over for that property, but anyone with vision can see what‚Äôs truly possible there. 

Good for you and your family man that‚Äôs great, you‚Äôve got a great place with so much potential and I can‚Äôt wait to see how it turns out. Keep up the great works man."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I‚Äôm so excited to see Tavarish renovate this home‚Ä¶ love how he‚Äôs trying to make new content
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Massive congrats on this house purchase Freddy. Hope that you, your wife, your kids and your pets come to love and enjoy the property. Keep lots of mosquito repellent handy, remember to use it often and you should be fine."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Every time you think something is a bad idea, it elevates this channel to the next level. We‚Äôre here to support you through this journey, keep us updated bro!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Congrats Tavarish... You deserve an amazing house , Everything about your channel makes me happy , best channel on Youtube by far. Thank you"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"You have a right to be so excited about this house! It is an amazing house with tons of potential, and the size of the property is great to have, also. Hours and hours of renovation are ahead of you, but as you accomplish things project by project, you will get a real sense of accomplishment and joy! Honestly, the price of this house plus the cost of renovation are staggering for me to grasp, but will bring worlds of enjoyment to you and your family! The very best of luck to you!!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Looking forward for all these upcoming projects! The house looks amazing and i  believe it will be even better when it's finished!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"As with all of your other content, I'm sure this will be amazing. I hope this all works out for you! (I'm really curious about that shelter. A good sump pump may be required)"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"This was fun to watch! Thank you! I see this having a lot of potential. There are a lot of things you have there that can be repurposed. For that water slide for example, you could use that to come down off the 2nd floor to the 1st floor inside the house. Save time on the stairs. A few good places to create a hidden panic room inside the house. Pool area, have one portion of the pool divided and sealed off from the rest of the main part of the  pool. Don't add pool water to the separated side. Keep it dry. Use that portion as a bar with a gazebo roof above, so your guests swim up to the pool bar without having to get out of the pool. Place fake fiberglass or concrete rocks where slide was at. Incorporate a video projector within the rock to project onto a movie screen. Watch a movie while in the pool. All those tropical trees around you in the backyard would be great to find a couple of old boats that are beyond disrepair and turn them into wrecked pirate ships for scenery. Pirates of the Caribbean style. That portion of the house where there was nothing there but a ledge wall, put some fake plants up there. No watering needed. Lol! Or you could have a projector 3D map images onto that wall. I see so many things that you can do to it. My house, I went crazy with mine. And the funny thing about it is, you're never done! There still is always more things to do and it is so much fun. And yes, you can never have too much garage! I've got a 4 car garage and an additional 1 car garage under the patio deck and it is still not enough! Lol! Congratulations on your home purchase. You'll have a lot of fun with this. One more thing, that guitar with the white pickups with the white switches. Is that an Intermark or a Teisco guitar?"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"This is really cool dude, I've been following you since you did repairs in your parents garage! You deserve the success! It's a great looking house and can't wait to see progress. And I'm so keen to see what is in the bomb shelter! Definitely turn the shed into a home gym"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats on the new house and I'm sure looking forward to seeing the renos.  This makes great content.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Congratulations sir, love the crib and keep up the hard work with the content. You‚Äôve been doing big things and your work doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,This house has sooooo much potential. The backyard could easily be turned into having a complete vacation vibe. Excited to see what you do with this house. Should totally make a bonsai shed and get your mr.Miyagi going.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Having a proper enclosed space for all the pool equipment is a must, and a high priority for things to do, considering the cost of it all, and the maintenance needed. Fencing off the jetty/dock may be a good idea in the future, and/or having a handrail along one side of it at least."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,This is gonna be super exciting to watch!!! Congratulations. I can't wait to watch videos of you fixing this house up. 100000% post tons of content on this house!!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Love what you do, very excited to see how the home project goes."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Looking forward to seeing what you do with the house! I watched every episode of Matt Carriker building his abandoned mansion and loved it, and I‚Äôm sure yours will be as good if not better!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Remember the goal isn‚Äôt to have a house, it‚Äôs to have a home. Fill it with your friends and chosen family. Share your success with those you love, and the less fortunate and you will find happiness and purpose. Good Luck to you Freddy, you earned it."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Congratulations to you and your family! Love the features of your new home. I also can't wait to run from my HOA and find peace and solitude. I'm sure you'll make your new home a gem on that lake. God's speed and good luck. Love on the wife a little harder during the process,  because renos are tough and baby proof everything."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Very happy for you! This place is absolutely awesome! Can't wait to see it cleaned up/ refubished üòç Big high five, from Norway!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,This series is gonna be awesome!! I can't wait to watch this happen.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"love the house and kudos to the previous owners as they had some great thoughts and plans, I love the poolside kitchen. All it needs is love and to be modernised."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Greetings from Finland, the home of the sauna. For the stove, I would definitely change the stones. IF you do not know when those have been changed the last time. At least in Finland sauna stones do not cost much, but those make a huge difference on the experience. Old well used stones have lost their thermal properties and might have started to break down. or release all stored heat too quickly, resulting in harsh ""l√∂yly""/the steam coming out from the stove when throwing water on the heated stones. Also when you have removed the stones, clean/rinse the stove from any dust, broken bits from the stones, before laying the new stones.

Otherwise a Finnish style sauna (that you seem to have) is very easy to maintain. Just check if the wooden benches are ok, not moldy or anything underneath. If ok, then just enjoy using the sauna and remember to let it dry out properly after each sauna event. Good ventilation keeps sauna healthy."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"So excited for this! Well done Tavarish! Yes, the subscribers have helped but you are a world leader content creator! Keep it up man! You deserve all the success!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Beautiful house. I absolutely love the outdoor kitchen setup and pool. Can't wait to see the rebuild of it all.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Congrats man! really beautiful home. yes, it needs work but the house has so much potential and i hope you enjoy renovating your new home."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congratulations! I've been following since the Gallardo project and couldn't be happier for you. I wish you all the best in this project and hope it turns out better than you expected
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"In regards to the bricks in the tree, It was a common way to cover up cuts and scars in trees in the 60s around when this house was built. It's not actually brick, but tar that's stuffed and petrified then carved. Really cool you got a tree with it!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"If this turns into endless videos of a house being refurbished, i just gonna go to work and not watch!
Congrats on the house, you earned it, i just dont wanna pay for it by watching videos i thought were about cars. (Like rob from Speedhunters) dropped that channel fast"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Freddy: ""ive spent my life savings to buy a house""
Also freddy: *procceeds to keep 1mil$ worth of car parts in his garage*"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"it's an amazing and gigantic house! it does need a lot of work but it's in the spirit of the channel and just like the cars, there's nothing non-doable here."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,He totally deserves this we need to give him more views to fix this house up! Congrats freddy
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"The whole time im just hoping and saying to myself ‚Äú I wish he gets sponsored by landscaping/construction companies‚Äù so we can see the transformation happen faster while we still get quality car related videos at the same time. Eitherway, congrats Freddy! I still remember an old video of yours when you were repairing a car in your parent‚Äôs driveway, and seeing how far you made it makes me really happy for you!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I came for the car content and stayed for you. You are such a natural in front of the camera and your personality is awesome. Congratulations on the house and good luck with the renovation. I look forward to watching this project progress.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats to you and your family.  Well deserved and looking forward to the building episodes.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"I definitely will watch the soon to come videos as you go on with the renovation. With the shed I was going to say convert it into a tiny guest house but turns out you've already got one of those üòÖ. Maybe just keep it as a place for all your landscaping tools. If not use it for storage for car parts or even tools depending on how big you intend make your garage into. By the way that backyard looks so insane, I love it. Can't wait to see the pool and spa all cleaned up.ü§©"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,This home renovation series is going to be dope. Truly looking forward to it
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Having done 139 ground up remodels and averaging 4-5 home flips per year with extensive remodeling, you did well. 
This house is far from being in trouble, it's just dated. $250-300k and this house will be drop dead gorgeous. Obviously, you can go cheaper and do more basic work or much more extravagant, but I would eye in 250-300k."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"CONGRATULATIONS! such amazing house! looks like it will be like a safe heaven for you and your projects! Also, cant wait for the next CarTrek!!!!!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congratulations and looking forward to this build and renovation over the years üëèüëè
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"If this man can fix that McClaren I‚Äôm pretty sure he can get this house done! 

Let‚Äôs go Tavarish!!!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congratulations!!! I still remember my excitement when we took the decision to finished the pending new house behind our old house great feelings and amazing experience!!!!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Freddy, if you were anybody but yourself, im sure a lot of us wouldnt be watching. Keep doing you. You deserve all of the great fortune you receive."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Awesome Freddy! May you and your family enjoy that house for many years and may it always be full of blessings.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"@Tavarish as an architect-engineer from Europe i am glad to see that you bough a house with a good concrete foundation and brick walls. You wont have any problems even in the worst case scenario (hope never needed). Its a good buy, now you can spend from 200k to a million depending on your needs renovating. If you want to stabilize your soil you can always dig around the perimeter of the house and plant tall tree trunks every 4-6 meters and 5-10 meters deep. This will keep corrosion of the soil close to the house steady no matter the weather conditions."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,So excited for this series!! Huge Congrats on the house Tavarish!!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Mate, congratulations on the house. We watch and subscribe to your channel because the content is enjoyable. So, keep up the good work and enjoy the house with your family. Bless you always."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Can't wait to see how everything comes together this is going to be a great video series
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Damn this is beautiful congratulations you deserve it man! Can't wait to see what you do with it üòÄ
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I love how you do houses the same as you do cars... great video!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"I‚Äôm sure there is a good bit of your audience that is not excited about this because they only watch videos for cars, but I think this is fantastic! As if you‚Äôre in my 30s seeing home renovations is actually really intriguing. And I know once you get it to where you want it to be you‚Äôll have a unparalleled level of satisfaction. And it will house (pun intended) tons of great content even once the house and garage are finished."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats Freddie. We all know that one thing you're really good at is restoring old broken stuff. Excited to see what you will do .
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"That‚Äôs an awesome property congratulations absolutely looking forward to see what you do with , do you fish ? The lake sold me , I love fishing , I think it is amazing what your doing . Sincerely looking forward to future episodes do time lapse as much as you can I know that‚Äôs your specialty. üòä"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Really love to see the upcoming DIY house videos! Congrats on the house!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Tavarish, am so happy for you. Best of luck & love from üá¨üáß. 
Love all your content on YouTube"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"This is awesome! Congratulations man! Maybe set up a collab with everyone's favorite tech Canadian Linus for all the updates your home will need!

You definitely need a racing sim rig room somewhere in there too!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I'm extremely excited to see this content.  This is like an endless pit of content that will keep giving no matter how much you throw at it.  Even when you think you're done you'll still have 100 videos you can pull together. Daunting to think of yet fun at the same time.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I'm a carpenter by trade a gear head at heart so I'm excited to see your home building skills.. Congratulations Freddy your a great Dude and I can't wait this should be an awesome series...
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Variety is the spice of life. Can't wait to see you turn this house into a home mate, and many congratulations. Karma has gone the correct way."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I am looking forward to seeing you rehab and update the whole house. Great move on your part.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"congrats Tavarish, will continue to watch and support you, always love your videos and it makes my flat look like the s**t on your shoe LMAO"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"This is literally one of the most beautiful houses i've ever seen. Definitely deserved  been a subscriber since the early days of the channel, you worked so hard to come to this and you deserved every bit of it"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Wow! A sauna! Just judging from the video it looks a bit ""under ventilated"", I would definitely put some more vents at the floor level and to the rear wall of the sauna. :)"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"That project life is addicting, it translates to cars, home and makes you look at everything different and how you can improve it. Congrats tavarish on the new home! üëè"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,That property will require a bunch of upkeep but I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing it! Congrats and I hope you‚Äôre the warranty when it comes to hurricanes too
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Awesome house Tavarish!  You forgot one thing at the end and I remembered it from when I bought my house.  You are the warranty.  Best of luck to you in your new home.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Well there's enough projects there to keep Freddie busy and the content coming for years! Lots of potential and it's really not in too bad of shape. You would be surprised on how much just color and texture changes can do to bring outdated finishes into today's styles! I Build and maintain recording studios here in Nashville and have a few ideas already for you're guest house.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Nice house, a lot of potential once you look past everything that needs to be done but definitely can make money on it should you wish to do so in the future!!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Well, your backyard is a prime location for a small off-road track! You can make a super-cool off-road track and then include fun backyard infrastructure around that track! Maybe even something very short where you can keep cool off-roaders in ""display positions"".

Have fun clearing the backyard btw: you will never believe how much work it is, how much stuff you'll be cutting down and carrying out per square foot!! But then again IMO it's fun work, and easy to do yourself (except cutting down trees, that's best left to professionals...but handling the felled trees is lots of work for you then). Just some good cutting equipment, a reliable quad, and then a place to lug that stuff (probably best to rent out huge skips, which they'll then carry out or then pile it up somewhere where you can have someone come pick it all up). Could be best to use a skid steer even, cut out the process of loading and unloading the quad's trailer and just grab piles and carry them directly to the pick-up point."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Wow!! My first reaction was of panic, I am an architect and I am intimately familiar with such projects, this is a huge endeavor and could be all consuming, all depends on your attitude and appetite for huge undertakings, all the best!!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Who else saw something crawl from the door of the shed at 16:11??  GREAT HOUSE Tavarish!! Congratulations and I can't wait to see the videos from this life upgrade!!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Never seen anyone so happy for stuff to not be working love this man.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,The base house and pool are amazing can't wait to see you get it renovated!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"It makes me happy we both have a Charger as our daily driver.

Good luck with the massive house! Hope you have time to show us some car stuff."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats on the new abode! I'm down for everything you do to it.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I never comment on YouTube videos but damn this a guy you can say truly deserves it with everything he has done and who is as a person congrats man I was flabbergasted on that house every time you went somewhere else your really happy in the vid can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs to come for every part of the journey üéâüòäüòÖ
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Congrats on the house man, hard work paying off."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats man! Beautiful home with amazing potential!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Wow congratulations on the house Freddie. It's really cool!! It seems like Florida has a similar climate like India except the hurricanes because of the vegetation and the mosquitoes üòÇüòÇ
Edit: I think the tree started growing around a pillar of some sort and formed around it or grew over it or maybe you're right the bricks may have been put inside later when the tree was hollow"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,The most ambitious project is an understatement. This is a really cool home and when you get done will be pretty awesome. I used to buy homes and renovate them and can say this is a big project. I can say this will be ten times as much as your Mclaren build. This will be a fun watch for many episodes. Great luck.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Walking around the house, I was thinking yeaaah, that's pretty nice... But once you showed us the path to the lake, I was like wooooooah nice... Sounds like we may see a speedboat restoration project in the future :D

Also looking forward to the housewarming invitation, you have enough space to put nearly all your subscribers now :D"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Some vines and plants could break the foundation of walls (especially outer walls), eventually causing them to be destroyed completely. If you could replace the vines with some less aggressive ones (there are some special vines that don't damage walls and structures), it would look very nice."
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats! What a great house! That pool is going to be amazing when done.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"It looks so good, its really inspiring! Keep up the good work üëè"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congratulations! This is an incredible house to call a home!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,I am more excited to see you document the progress of this home than I am of any cars you are currently working on.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Freddy thought fixing the McLaren was expensive. Now he's gonna discover what expensive really means. It's cool, but without a maid, gardener and pool guy it would be a pain in the ass to keep it clean. But I'm sure you're gonna figure it out.

Also: who knew Freddy play guitars?"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congrats dude u really deserve it! Been following u for a couple years now and u are still my favourite youtuber!
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"Inspiring to see this Freddie, I‚Äôve been around since the white Gallardo and remember seeing it run on the dyno with the twin turbos. You‚Äôve worked so hard for this and deserve all the success you reap, enjoy the house and just like the cars, remember you are the warranty!"
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Wow! This mansion has a lot of potential! Cant wait to see what you are planning for it.
2,bsbnGeT9ies,Congratulations man üëç Looking forward to the ongoing projects
2,bsbnGeT9ies,"You've come a long way from the humble beginnings Freddy and it goes without saying that you deserve everything that you've worked so hard for! 
I really hope soon we can see the musical side of your work, I completely forgot that you were a guitar player until I saw the collection.. maybe it's time to add a Misha Sig üëÄ"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"after all the crazy happenings of the last few months, im more then ready to see the escalade finally get its motor. these things are always rad and seeing this one come back to life would be amazing"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"When you can at least break even on a bad deal, and actually make a profit life is good. At least you have the money to play with a forgotten project üëçüôÇ"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Glad you got out of the Tesla without losing money. Escalade should be a good and  lucrative project. üòÅ
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,for the L94 engine buy a kit that disables the cylinder deactivation. makes it alot more reliable!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them. Nice job making a small profit on the Tesla. Love your constant optimism. The Escalade should be totally rad."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Let me recommend something:  

When you get the 6.2 back in the Escalade, please go get the DOD system tuned out. I learned the hard way. I also bought a 2013 Escalade from a dealer, low mileage, and I listened in the engine and couldn‚Äôt hear anything in it. Literally a week later; the engine started doing valve train chatter. 

Needles to say, after $4,600 and some change I literally have the whole engine rebuilt‚Ä¶minus the rotating long block stuff. New lifters, valves, all of it. 

If you get the engine in, and it‚Äôs quiet, I would still at least get it tuned out."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Now the Tezla is a win, even if you broke even. Some good content, think everyone learned a bit, and you don‚Äôt have the pain of parting it out. Nicely done!"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Knowing when to stop and move on is really hard at times.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Good work!! That was too bad about the Tesla but there were indeed too many problems to be worth it (like you said, just to have an outdated Tesla!"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I'm still mad at GM for ruining such a good engine with DOD. However I understand why they did it. Tune it out and enjoy it for a long time
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Good riddance to the Tesla and I'm glad you still turned a profit on it. You already have a good EV, the Volt, which I've always liked and were only discontinued because of the gas-powered range extender--there's clearly a whole ""plug in battery only"" agenda behind this nonsense and I wish more people will wake up and realise that everything we do on cars ends within the next decade or so."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Thank god!  I really didn't like the pricey and complicated repairs (or lack thereof) on exotic-ish cars.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"I love how you realise when its time to get rid of a bad purchase.
It happens, we're human!"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Sad to see the Tesla go but you did a good call. Your definitely gonna make a few bucks on the Escalade.  Any news on a new shop as of yet? Keep up the great work.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I hope that new Engine is as good as it seems. You deserve a break after that Tesla ...
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"i‚Äôve been looking for this platform for a couple months now, in my area the Escalade is cheaper than the Tahoe, i honestly would rather have the Tahoe (LTZ obviously) and not fear little things breaking and paying thousands for it."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"I heard there was a class action law suit to fix lifter issue with 2013 thru 2018, I think. The manufacturer has to fix them."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Nicely done on the Tesla!  Looking forward to seeing new projects!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I pretty sure I can go a few months now without seeing another EV. Your a lot younger than me so you enjoy the tech crap more than me !!! Lol
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I‚Äôm so excited to finally see the Escalade live This generation is my favorite they look and drive so good
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I probably would have installed the factory supercharged CTSV in it had I gotten the Escalade at that price. I do prefer turbos normally but as a daily driver that‚Äôs just the way I‚Äôd go. Might port the supercharger and use a smaller pulley though.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"""People typically fix these. They don't throw them away"". Oh, you mean the POLAR OPPOSITE OF EV'S?!? Constantly buying new & throwing away what was engineered NOT to be serviceable is sooo green!! (Also applies to modern ICE cars.)"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Another great video from JR. Keep it going
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Good luck with that engine ! id do a DOD delete to make it bulletproof especially if you want to boost it   the parts are actually only around 600-700 $  I just did this to my 2010 Yukon Denali hybrid bought at auction had collapsed lifter 130k guys at my shop i work at  thought it had a rod knock because of the low oil pressure warning  on dash but all it needed was a odd deleted  and running like brand new  oil pressure is up around 55 - 65 cold 40 hot #! exhaust lifter cylinder 6 collapsed and dod filter was plugged up truck runs like new and i suspect another 200k+ out of it before any other failures
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Glad you got out of the Tesla. I like ‚Äòem too, that one just didn‚Äôt give me a great feeling. Love the Escalade more though in this instance"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"I have a 2007 escalade esv.  Absolutely love it. Bought it with 160,000 miles on it. Now has 250,000 on it.....original engine and transmission.  Was one owner when I bought it. It's all about how well you take care of your vehicle üòä"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Uncle Rich does have good advice some days....  Glad you got rid of the money pit, hope to see the Escalade bring you some glory and was wondering how things are going in Wichita after those massive tornadoes we saw earlier this year."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,You made all the right moves.  Escalade needs a new life
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,How to turn electrons into protons and make a vroom vroom sound lol. Hopefully another Tesla that‚Äôs worth fixing shows up for you eventually.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Escalade: balling on a budget
-regular car reviews"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"The Escalade needs an oil change every 5,000 miles; got it. üòé"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Run a car fax on the Yukons‚Äôs vin (where the motor came from) you may/should see when it was replaced, which will give you a batter idea on mileage on the motor."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Are you ever gonna be in another big shop again? Loved that shop and all the hard work you put in it. Cant wait for you to be in another one.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Futuristic car of the future: *Doesnt get saved*
Junk Escalade used offroad literally beaten into the dirt: *Gets Saved*"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Now you just need some Cleetus valve covers and you're good to go.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Well, I suppose you technically did an LS swap on the Tesla."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Hmmm, a less than 10 year old EV is ""mechanically totaled"".  But we're not supposed to be EV haters......  My daily driver 01 Jeep has almost 260k miles and still running strong.  Either way, great content from JR as always."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Some are just not worthy of rebuilding especially one with a bad battery and so old.  
Get you a Model 3 to fix up with front end damage and it will be easy!"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Glad you sold it and it was a good little series üëç.  Thanks
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Keep them coming!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Owwwwyeah! You are making the right decisions again. Now sell the McLaren en you‚Äôre good to go!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"The 6.2 can live a long life, mine has over 260,000 miles"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,best thing you could have done other than never buying it in the first place!!! üëç
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I like it better when you don't have a big shop. More like when you first started the channel.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Why not do a DOD delete on the new engine. I'm sure everyone that is willing to DIY  an engine swap on their own Escalade would 100% be ditching the DOD .
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I look forward to another WatchJRGoTesla project but getting rid of that particular one was a wise choice.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I'm sooo glad I got the 07 Escalade with the 6.2 WITHOUT all the cylinder on demand or flex fuel or any of that.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR VIDEOS J.R. ü§£ü§£
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"its less the oil change (though that helps), and more the fact that the springs in the DOD lifters fail, and there's literally no way to stop that.

DOD/AFM deletes forever."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Am I the only one wondering who bought the Tesla? I'm betting Uncle Rich would be high on the list of possibilities. On second thoughts, Rich might be too cheap to pay $8k for it..."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Good buy on the escalade engine. I just had trans rebuilt in my 03
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"If rich rebuilds tells you to dump that dumpster fire of a Tesla, you listen! lol"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"I have a soft spot for the lwb, full size, gm suvs... Hope that ESV gets a nice long second life somewhere."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"You pay your money you take your chances, but at least you came out on top and are able to wrench another day."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Why not disable the Destruction on Demand after the install and never have to worry about the engine again?
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Why not remove everything for DOD, it would pretty much last forever after that."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Update on that old farm tractor you and your Dad were working on!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,At least it will take up for the loss with the Bentley
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I got 99 rt Dakota I try change my oil every 3k miles an it's full synthetic I know it last more yeah so. I look inside the rockers cover and it's looks clean like it came out of the assembly line. I use to work in lKQ they use the power washer to clean them.üëç
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Delete the DOD system, make it last forever"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,awesome i learn a lot of things from your videos thanks
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I had to get an engine for a Nissan NV van. Fortunately it was a recent rebuild when I went to install it
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Yesss love them SUV‚Äôs they just have that look üòé
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,I thought you were getting anew camera? That on ein low light is pretty bad. Otherwise hell yeah get that Escalade back on the road!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,That's  a nice ride. It should not take long to get it on the road.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Man, had a bad trot recently, lol."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"They probably deleted DOD during rebuild. I know they have to change the valley cover, not sure what else."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"GREAT!! The ""Tezla"" gone!,  the problem laden Bentley gone! Back to some  real winning."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"No DOD delete while the ""new"" engine is out? A cammed 6.2 would be fun."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Please may we see the camera woman - love to see who's behind the camera - and thank you for bringing us A V8 once again. The only great V8's are USA V8's
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Not a bad outcome for you on the Tesla given all the issues and expense
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Good choice for sure üëç
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Smart move dumping the Tesla. Money üí∞ in your pocket!
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,First thing after the engine swap is disable the DOD. It will help reduce the problem.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,rip tezla (i completely forgot you bought an escalade üíÄ)
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"At least you got away from the Tesla when you can. Anyway, if you still wanted an electric car, how about bidding on that Tesla swapped Nissan 350Z that was built by #Throtl in San Diego?"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"They say if you tie a sock on a cable midway and it snaps it will stop where the sock is and won't take your head off... So if you are winching, keep a sock handy. Worth doing if you ask me."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Oil change every 3k miles..and a Range Device in the OBD port.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"""I am 100% in"". Well we know you aren't 100% Jake! üòÇ

Oh and DOT says 4 points of connection even for a couple miles."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,escalade is better than tesla. conventional oil be fine i change oil 3 months.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"had a 19 escalade,  hated it.  Rode rough,  interior did not live up to a 100K plus vehicle.
My Trucks rode smoother and quieter.     All you buy is a Cadillac name which is not
what it use to be.   If got another Cadillac would go with the V sedan.  Right now my
100K plus lincoln is much nicer."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Two questions did Rich rebuilds buy your Tesla and  cold days pulling engine outside ouch.  Good episode of the Jr reality show
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Nice JR! Are we at 2 vehicle quits?
I guess it back to the rolls then. üòÇ"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Can you build a new shop in the same area of your dad workshop or will that cause issues because you don‚Äôt own the land?
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Dayum 130 thousand miles until it breaks down. I have a 1999 Chevy Tahoe has 225 thousand miles. And still running strong. I wouldn't want a escalade lol
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,10k mile interval? Seems a little long
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Why not AFM delete it whilst swapping the engine?
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"I work at lkq, it‚Äôs so clean cuz we cap off all the holes and power wash it, lol any oil leaks it had got washed away"
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,you sold it to Rich and he's going to use the parts from it isn't he? lol
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good decision
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"""...Know when to walk away, know when to run."""
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"Aww, finally an interesting car, and you decide to back out of it... :("
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Going that far why not go ahead and do the dod/afm delete?
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,We need to get the Rolls smoke on the channel
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Who does oil changes at 10k plus?? They're asking for problems.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Hoping that you will get a shop before long.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,"1:00 in the morning for me, not missing a beat."
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,Not sure about this new direction of content. Sells the cool wear house üè† and now buys crap ( we all know JR is not gonna fix) then punts them üëéüèª. More of your Dad ‚Ä¶.
2,-7m7UhNvyVE,At least it doesn't need a thirty THOUSAND dollar harness and a thirty five THOUSAND dollar install. That Bentley was deliberately murdered by the manufacturer.

I still remember the jar of jolly ranchers she kept on her desk, and she is the reason why they are my favorite candy. Lol. I just wanted to give her a shout-out. She really is one of the best teachers I've ever had and I will never forget her! Merry Christmas and Happy holidays to you and Mrs. Kilmer üòä"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"‚ÄúThe dentist does a crappy job I‚Äôll do it myself with this glue‚Äù A normal person I‚Äôd say what the hell are you thinking, but it‚Äôs Scotty so I‚Äôm really not surprised üòÇ"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"You got me with the line ""I finally got my wife on camera."""
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Gotta HAND it to ya, Scottie, you hooked me with the wife on camera tease!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Looong time subscriber and as ALWAYS Scotty you crack me up. I'm a professional RV tech and an amature auto mechanic. Just wanted to let you know that I have had 4 4.0 liter engines in 4 different Ford trucks and wanted to let you know that those things are bullet-proof. They get great mileage for a V6 and plenty of power. Don't know if you ever did a vid on those or not. 
Merry Christmas to you and Mrs. Kilmer's hand. 
Signed, happy subscriber"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"I got to ""hand"" it to you for getting your wife on camera!!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,The glue sounds like the prep is probably a bonding agent called silane coupling agent. It makes such a huge difference. The Catalyst for silane is moisture so as the glue or finish coat is on top of it and condensation forms between the layers the silane activates locking it down. It is also used in the dental industry and aerospace industry and... the bathtub refinishing industry is coming around to it. Like everything there are different qualities of silane. I pay $100 for a quart and it's used full strength but yes sir it is great stuff!
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Entertaining, funny, and informative as always, Scotty. Keep the films coming, one of the few things consistently worth watching on the internet."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Dentist $250.00/ hour. Scotty under $30.00 in 5 minutes. It's all about saving money and not getting ripped off. Priceless Scotty, your the best üëç‚úåÔ∏èü§ô"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,I appreciate Scotty's endorsement of Oxyclean for laundry! I just used it on a tote bag!... OMG using Tech Bond on your tooth - Glad it had no harmful chemicals. You're such a survivor! ü•∞
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Wow Scotty. Your wife is a gem.
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty is the gift who keeps on giving.
An amazing, inspirational, high octane energy boost."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Haha, Scotty and my dad have that super gluing their tooth in common!!  ü§£üëç"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty...you are great...beyond description, thank you. We all love you!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Scotty using commercial super glue for dental work‚Ä¶man‚Äôs a gd legend.
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,I swear I would rather pay a $100000 to buy Scotty's memory bank because that's the kind of stuff that's raw real and true you can't buy with money and monetary value he has something that his grandchildren should cherish for the rest of their lives and share it absorb it and spread it
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"When my tooth fell of from implant, I took a drill, made a hole through both tooth and implant, and screwed a bolt to hold the tooth! Next time I was thinking about using TIG welding but you, Scotty, saved me - I would use superglue!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Absolutely hilarious. Scottie is so genuiheaven repairs his own teeth and shares experience with us üòÜüöÄüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He can fix anything
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Having your wife agree was ""handy"" üòÇ"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Man this guy is so funny, I love your videos Scotty"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Glueing your tooth back in with Techbond, your a legend Scotty.
Probably much better than the dentists glue!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty, you are hilarious!üòÇüòÇ"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,The hammer Scotty used for the tooth operation should be in the Scotty museum üòÇ I know I‚Äôd like to see it.
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Hey Scotty! Thanks for the redline funnel recommendation just ordered the red one. This hopefully will make it easier now to put gas in my 2016 Nissan Sentra.

Keep up the great videos 

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY! üéÑ‚õÑ"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"How funny, I have that exact same sawzall in my basement tool room.  Thanks Scotty for what you do. Your knowledge is invaluable.   I think your a super nice person."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty, I had the same problem with stuff sliding around in the trunk of my corolla so ...
I bought some Velcro and put the fuzzy sides down on the trunk rug, evenly spaced SMALL pieces, the hook side on the bottom of a plastic tote. Let it sit for 24 hours as per the instructions and wah la!! I can now put that tote anywhere in the trunk and it doesn't move! This is an inexpensive fix to a problem."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Every time Scotty recommend something and I buy it it works fabulous. Hes of great service to his subscribers üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöÄüòá  Thank you so much Scotty
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"You know Scotty I‚Äôve been trying to figure out for years what watching your videos is like well I finally figured it out it‚Äôs just like sour milk you know it‚Äôs gonna smell but you just have to smell it!!
Only joking all kidding aside I just wanted to say Merry Christmas and have a great up and coming New Year!!üéâüéâüòä"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Very thankful Scotty didn‚Äôt glue his mouth shut when reinserting his tooth.  All the video‚Äôs we would have never seen!  ü§£
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"I once replaced a tooth filling with car body filler because a new filling fell out, a second filling fitted free by the same dentist fell out, so I went the DIY route.  It worked, just as Scotty's glue worked.  Of course this self-dentistry is not ideal but how patient can you be, how many bills must you pay and how many hours in the waiting room?  Head for the garage!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"I knew it , Scotty always wanted to be Hermey the Misfit Elf dentist in Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer ; there is a resemblance. Love this video, I laughed so much. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Scotty is my hero. Glue + tooth = üòÅ
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,You‚Äôre a National Treasure and people need to appreciate what you do! There are not enough honest car guys out there. The truth often hurts. Too darn bad. Never apologize to the idiots out there.
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"""I got my wife on camera""

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Hey Scotty, wasn't able to catch you last year in RI, glad to hear you're back! I'm outside of Providence, born and raised. Any interest in making a video, something like ""sourcing a work truck in New England""? Id love to pay you to look at a few rigs with me. I really want to get a 3/4 ton work truck."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Would love to see more videos on stuff to buy for the car to carry with you
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Love your channel Scotty your decent honest human being. I live in Clarksville Tennessee I drove a Toyota Highlander 2016. I change the oil every 5000 miles change the filter at the Toyota dealership every 10,000 miles with the oil. I'm an extremely conservative driver. When I change the oil every 5000 miles it looks great is this okay or do I have to change the filter every 5000 miles. The new filters are just too much for me I use Mobil one synthetic oil the one made for 20,000 miles. But I change it every 5000 miles."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty watch ya every day,Luv ya bro!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,We love you Scotty thank you once again
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Coincidentally just used the Tech Bond yesterday to repair headlights. One extra step to keep it fresh: store it refrigerated.

Too funny glueing the tooth ü¶∑!! Lol"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Not ""cheap"" Scotty,  thrifty and practical üòâ"

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"I saw his wife years ago walking up the house stairs during taping a show, he then had someone tell him he married up.  He then said he was a good looker too when he was young.  LOL!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty, thank you for these recomondations. Ordering the TechBond Solutions now!!"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"A human body is essentially a machine, a car is a machine, Scotty melds the both"

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,You are a hoot  bless you and your lovely wife!
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"if the funnel neck is long enough, it might be great for Honda small engines and CHondas (oil fill)"
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Her hand is beautiful. No age spots! What's her secret. Nails look great, too. You are a lucky husband, Scotty!"

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"I presume the hand with the ring (I get it, it proves she really married Scottie) is his wife. It is a lovely hand and she must have the patience of Job."

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty, I have squecks in my 1992 ford explorer door coming from the rubber to metal contact on the rear hatch.  What works best to stop the squeches?"

2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Big up to Mr and Mrs kilmer and the rest of the family
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Unfortunately, here in Minnesota many of these Wi-Fi cameras,, etc. fail in the winter.  I typically recommend folks in the great white north only purchase these sorts of items after checking the temperature ratings.  Many only have a rating of 14 degrees F. 

CHECK THE TEMP RATINGS BEFORE YOU BUY, IF YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHLAND."
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,"Scotty: ""Well, it's time to show you folks the mother of all money pits... My wife"""
2,2m3RPs9nAwU,Dr. Kilmer I presume lol üòÇ you rock Scotty

2,SmCLCHddvE0,"When he said he'll never forget this, is when you know he enjoyed it coming from a 4cyl engine. That is the truest thing anyone can say. It's something else to have experienced power from a 4cyl engine. There's nothing else like it."
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Sam is such a genially nice dude. Seeing him smile like that is just amazing. Thank you for sharing this moment with us all.

Sam Will turn around a crappy day into a good l day in a moment. It's been several years since I last saw him when I used to live in South Florida (he has lived in SRQ forever!)  now that I moved up here it would be a pleasure to see him again. Anyhow the NSX is a beast. Makes me want to get one and do a Kswap lol"

2,SmCLCHddvE0,"Sam was ready to go again hahaa. Great content right here, his face just lit up had me smiling."
2,SmCLCHddvE0,I am so happy for Sam!! He is living the life. Awesome video man!
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Love Sam‚Äôs genuine reaction! Smiles for days üòä
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Can't beat how genuine Sams reaction. Awesome of you to entertain Sam on his first Honda 1000 hp vehicle.
2,SmCLCHddvE0,"Sam is awesome. My dad was always preaching there was no replacement for displacement until I planted him in the seat in my Evo X that was still on the stock turbo but the upgraded clutch and Shep trans and t-case made it easy to shock people. He wasn't a believer until I got my supercharged Elise that rev'ed to 9250 RPMs on a built 2ZZ with a nice TVS 1320 blower. My fondest memories are from mixing 110 leaded and 93 unleaded, listening to the titanium header back as it let out nice blue and purple flames on over runs, while casually hitting the top of 6th at 167 MPH."
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Sam is such a cool dude. Really enjoy the energy he brings to every video he's in.
2,SmCLCHddvE0,"Mr Sam seems like such a genuine soul, so glad to see him rip in the NSX and enjoy it"
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Sam is so genuine he‚Äôs such a happy go lucky guy!! What a great guy to have around all of you
2,SmCLCHddvE0,Man I do have to say George is just the best and being everybody's friend one of the smartest things Cletus has ever did was let George come work for him he is the greatest Improvement you have done in a long time on this show couldn't see the channel without him
2,SmCLCHddvE0,You had me grinning ear to ear taking care of Mr. Sam like that. Thank you Kyle.

2,eBRsSGCi13E,You rock on Scotty! Keep speaking the truth!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I get tired of these brand fan boys sticking up for certain brands that most of them know nothing about. That said I don't see anything wrong with someone like you warning people about pattern failures in cars or anything else. I too have seen several hemi cam and lifter failures and also don't recommend buying one. Hopefully these people get lucky with their new purchase. Keep doing what you're doing Scotty. We will keep watching.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty does the Absolute Best vehicle reviews EVER!!! Keep up the good work man!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,It appears the previous owner of the pickup truck was a professional fire fighter and so he had access to water and hoses and usually during their down time they wash their rigs and keep them clean.  They also usually pull boats for the weekend recreation. So a highway commuter truck that was kept clean and was used to transport the family and the boat. Good review.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Your review of the truck with your scanner is excellent.  Remember, it is always better to be pissed off than to be pissed on.  Your knowledge is second to none. Thanks for the review. Time will tell.  You will go down in history as one of the best !  Thanks for your information!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Can confirm Scotty's living right, his guardian angel protected him from that trailer hitch. The man upstairs knows the ol' guy is saving souls from making bad decisions."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty rocks, he is one hell of a mechanic"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I love your ‚ÄúHONESTY‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to find a good and honest mechanic. You‚Äôre the best Scotty! TYüëã
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Love the way Scotty works! Professional, fun, straight forward and sincere. Kudos! Cheers from Brazil.üí™üí™üëçüëç"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty is a super great person! We üíïhim!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I didn't think you'd find anything wrong with that beautifully built RAM! Great review! I had 05 Dodge Ram, Bought the 7 miles on it, drove it down every two track in Michigan twice.... put 217000 some miles on it! I took good care of changing fluids after muddin' two tracking. Minor maintenance issues. But I'm diesel mech from Marines. Nothing ever major on that vehicle. I beat the piss out of it!! wheel bearings went and such, changed them, fuel pump at 200,000. I hated getting rid of it. Must have been a Tuesday built truck. LOOOL! I only got stuck 4 times needing a yank. I had it programmed too, it just ripped through the mud in 4 wheel drive! It was awesome! zero f's given when driving. And it was my daily driver.... all highway to work, I miss that batch!! LOOOL! Barely any technology, roooooom for days under the hood. Sooooo easy to work on!!!!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I got one of those and it's been great so far thanks Scotty this video is a big help with the data point and what to look for
2,eBRsSGCi13E,you are a class act Scotty ! much respect
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"You don't have to replace the entire Engine to fix the ""Hemi Tick."" If it was really that catastrophic, I doubt they would Sell the way they do. The V6 2nd generation Pentastars do it as well, and it's estimated that about 3-5% of them do that between the two, which is nothing when they make so many. Up until 2021 the Pentastar was in 14 of Stellantis vehicles, and is now into its 3rd generation, and the 3rd doesn't have the Tick issue. And just some are made in Mexico, but most are made at the newly renovated Jefferson Assembly Plant in Detroit."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I've had 1 Chrysler and 2 Dodge vehicles.  They all had electronic issues to the point where I had a big box in my garage full of old ECMs, PCMs, window regulators, radios, relays, etc.. that had been replaced at some point.  That was my biggest issue with them.  Their electronics suck!  You can't really properly maintain an ECM to prevent it from shorting out."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"The 3.7L and 4.7L were more prone to that lifter tick or worn out hydraulic Lifters. They are very delicate and sensitive to oil pressure/type. My 1500 with a 3.7L ticks on start up, but it tends to go away after a few minutes. It did this when I purchased it 30K miles ago, still works. The 3.7L is not a great engine, but it works. The dodge 1500's biggest benefit is that they are much cheaper than toyota, chevy, and in some cases ford because they have a bad reputation and nobody else wants them :)
People always hate, they play politics and are very loyal to their chosen vehicle manufacturer. I specifically chose a dodge truck when I weighed the cost and features I was looking for, at the time, it was the best choice for me."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Around here, in the Midwest, the bodies on these are almost have eaten away with rust, including the rear bumpers within just a few Years! Its shame."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Man you just tell the truth lol. What people forget is that there are always exceptions. But shoot you never guided me wrong
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I just traded my 16' Ram in for a 20' Tundra because of the Hemi Tick... after it was rebuilt once already, had less than 100k miles. Oil was changed every 5k miles, tried lucas low viscosity, liquimoly, redline oil, all of it. The Rams are nice trucks, they drive very well, very comfortable, plenty of power but the costly repairs just weren't worth it."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"The door module could be tied to the side airbags though, so you may not necessarily want to immediately dismiss that one.  The rest are not likely going to be an aissue in the case of an accident, but the door module could be, especially if it causes the side airbags to malfunction or not deploy in a crash.

At least this guy has a use for the truck (pulling a boat) unlike some people who don't tow or haul anything and would be better off with an SUV that gets 30 mpg versus 18 mpg (and even some SUVs can tow 3000-5000 lbs too, so you don't necessarily need a truck even if you have a smaller boat)."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"If you open your mouth there will be someone who will say bad things about you. Don't stop opening your mouth and helping all of us. We know not everything you say is perfect, but we appreciate you for what you doing for us. Thank you."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Always enjoy your videos Mr. Scotty!   You're the best mechanic on youtube
2,eBRsSGCi13E,scotty rocks - love his videos lots of great information
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty thanks to you I‚Äôve been patience and haven‚Äôt bought a used truck and now thanks to you I know what I am aiming for with my small budget
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"The more common tick is the the bolts breaking on the headers and you'll get a worsening tick as the exaust leak gets worse but goes away as the engine warms up. 
It amazing Chrysler hasn't resolved the bolt issue yet."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Usually Scotty is pretty good with his knowledge of the issues with many engines but he‚Äôs most likely completely wrong when it comes to the reasons behind the HEMI tick. There‚Äôs a lot of discussion online about the causes and even the engineers and engine designers have put their weight into the issue. The most commonly agreed upon problem is it‚Äôs caused by lifter lubrication problems. The causes of the lifter problems aren‚Äôt well known, but Chrysler did redesign certain aspects of their lifters after the ‚Äò16 model year, which alleviated some of the problems. Splash lubrication has been nearly eliminated as a cause."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,The most reliable Dodge truck is one you never drive.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I‚Äôve had 3 dodge chargers, an 06 RT, 06 SRT8,  and a 2012 SRT8. I also have a 2017 Ram 1500 with the 5.7 Hemi. Every Chrysler product I‚Äôve ever had has been extremely reliable. The only problems I‚Äôve ever had out of any of them is the AC compressor failed in the Ram. Besides that, I‚Äôve had fantastic luck with dodge and Chrysler products."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty is mad; the entire car industry is shocked.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Our man Skotty.. Protecting the people from corporate-greed
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"When Scotty says a vehicle is bad, people respond by saying that 'you only have one example,' as if they expect him to have multiple models all lined up to show the same problem at the same time."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I bought a brand new Dodge ram back in 2011, I started having problems with it with only 35,000 miles on it, moldings were popping off the interior started falling apart the quarter panel started rusting around the fender wells and I kept the truck clean. I have a 2011 Toyota tundra with 200,000 miles on it and the only thing that has ever broke was the horn."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty, as so often, this was very informative and also very entertaining.  ""King of the Morons,"" indeed.  Although, ""King of YouTube"" would be accurate."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty, I've owned 3 Dodge pickups with Hemi's , all of them have been great trucks. Just bought my fourth one 3/4 ton with a Cummins.  I just like them. But I appreciate your honesty,  I really enjoy listening/watching your show. Keep up the Great Work! Fan for Life!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"The Hemi tick is nothing to do with the cam or lifters. It is caused by the exhaust leak from the manifold bolts breaking. Sounds just like the lifters ticking and stops after the manifold heats up and expands. Had to fix this on my 2009 when I first got it 3 years ago.  And yes, they say if you let the hemi idle to much it can oil starve the cam. It's bad to let any engine idle for extended period of time. And yes, Scotty you are a hypocrite every time you talked about any Chrysler product through the years you always said they are pieces of crap. Now that they are sponsoring you or something there great.  Yes, I seen the Dodge ram history video you did!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I got to admit Scotty's pretty much right on and I work on cars toüëç I will not work on any cars that have any roaches in them.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,The honest mechanic that we all love. Truth is all cars break at one point or another.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Thanks for the information Scotty I hear a lot of chargers with that ticking sound I thought because it's cold outside.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Learn something every time! Didn't know about the hemi cams, do they have problems with that knock down to 4 cylinder? Like the GM's do?
I have a 2014 dually with a Cummins.
And it is scary how much electrical stuff the truck has! ü•¥"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,love your straight up analysis .Thanks!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,The tranny clunk usually happens when its cold and you first start driving it. Happens in the Pentastar motor too.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"As a Jeep owner I would always recommend a Chrysler, BUT 1 they get expensive to work on 2 my brother had a Ram from that generation and his tick led to a blown engine. The 3.6L Pentastar in my 2012 Wrangler is a great engine, unlike the previous V6 from 2011, but you need $50 for intake gaskets just to replace the spark plugs! You read correctly, you have to remove the intake! All modern vehicles have issues, they just don't build them like they used to."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,My friend brought me a dodge and it started with a tik.  After research and seeing the TSB saying use a high quantity filter. I removed the frame oil filter and found it was impermeable.  Poked some holes in it for the oil to flow and the problem went away.   It‚Äôs a GD conspiracy.  If they would explain what happens in the TSB people wouldn‚Äôt be ruining their engines.  Other than this I like dodge.  I kind of hate them all the same it‚Äôs a love hate thing.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"A good friend of mine bought a new Dodge just like this because he seen the problems I had with my F150.
He laughed at me for wasting $50g and then driving the junker I had for years before I got the new truck.
Now he has a new truck ( his first new truck) and I never see him drive it but he always has a reason 
 Mom's car needs an oil change 
The car seats are already in the wife's SUV so we just using her car 
The trailer is hooked to the truck so im using dads truck today
I have the work truck so why not drive it and save my gas
After 2 years I have not seen his truck other than on fb picks of it in the yard"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"You cant go wrong changing the vehicles oil every 5,000 miles!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"We got one 2017 Ram that had the hemi tick from day 1, everything that could break, broke, including the engine. When the warranty expired we trade it in and got a 22 Ridgeline, the only issue we had it shut off on its own because I forgot to deactivate the auto stop-start feature."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Hey Scotty I have a 2019 Ram 1500 and it's great. That guy shouldn't have called you out,. All vehicles have their weaknesses,  and it boils down how you drive your vehicles and maintain them. My ram sat four months and the battery was dead. I replaced the battery and the engine fired right up. The hemi tick was heard for a couple of minutes, and the check engine light came on. After a couple of minutes the tick went away and within a day the check engine light went out.  The 5.7 is good and I advoided the 1/2 ton ecotect. That's one sucks. I think time is running out on the hemi, and Chysler is replacing it with a 6 banger. That will probably have it share of problems. I rather keep the 5.7 than having a new 6 cylinder engine like the new Tundra (  TONZA MONEY, that new trucks has its share of problems with the turbo√≤ powering that truck."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Finally scotty someone else found out all the stuff you selling ain‚Äôt right
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty is dead serious this time üíÄ. 
His face üò° thru out the video üòÇüòÇ"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Next video ""I'm starting to like Dodge Rams and I'm pissed""üòÇ. Great video as usual Scotty"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Automakers now view the truck/SUV as a family hauler instead of a sedan which is why they are making them more luxurious
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Regarding the 5.7 hemi tick I understand the oil they have original in it is way to thin. Some guy I saw drained the original oil and replaced it wit 5w-30.  The tick went away. Myself my dodge is the 4.7 and I put 5w-20.  I have 123000 miles on it. Basic wear and tear I have changed the tires and the brakes.  My battery was the original 11 year battery so when I died I changed that and I had to replace the Altanator. I love my dodge but dodge is starting to price themselves out of business.  Oh forgot my dodge is a 2011 4x4 crew cab slt.  It was 36000 I got it for 30000. I waited 6 months before the 2012‚Äôs were coming out and bought it as a leftover.  I buy all my vehicles as leftovers because you can save a lot
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I am not a car junkie, but I love your show!!!  I am considering buying a key/fob coder to program keys and fobs.  Can you make some good money programming auto fob's and keys?  Do you do this?  If so, what machine do you think is best?"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I've seen neglected 5.7 liters make it to 300k miles. They were rock solid engines.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I bought a 2011 ram 1500 5.7 hemi and it was ticking with 195k miles, its now got 245k miles and still ticking but can't go over 3500 rpm without a misfire. I paid $6500 for it 5 years ago and mostly use it around town and never get to 3500 rpm. Only get misfires going  up big hills on the highway. I didn't know about the cam issues when I bought it, but I found out a few weeks ago after replacing the plugs and coils. Not that I want to swap an engine but its still cheaper than getting another truck and will last a lot longer. I can feel the slop in the cam revving it in neutral from 1500-3000 rpm, but I don't feel it when driving."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty, I love watching your channel, but in this video you explained a Hemi tick when there are two two types of Hemi ticks.  One is valve train/lifter related and the other is exhaust related.  Also, your reasoning that you explained was flawed.  I recommend researching the Hemi tick more.  There are other reasons why the Hemi tick occurs.  Besides that, great review video üëç"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"They are also known for broken exhaust manifold bolts which will also cause a ticking noise, worse when cold. If you catch the lifter tick early enough you can just replace the lifters which will fix the concern. What happens is people continue to drive and drive them and let the noise get louder and louder. By then it has wiped out a cam lobe. But you don‚Äôt have to rebuild the engine, you can replace the camshaft and all the lifters. That is the repair that is made. Though not cheap it is much cheaper than a reman engine."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Actually, Dodge does build their engines in Mexico. Then, depending on the vehicle, they put the cars together either in Mexico or Canada."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I‚Äôve found some of these hemi ticks isn‚Äôt always the cam lifter problem, but broken exhaust manifold fasteners."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Don't worry about this idiots calling you names Scotty I love your video's and you keep on doing them please we appreciate you‚ù§Ô∏è
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Shoot ur a top notch mechanic I luv to just sit and watch the videos u make. Teaches me wut to watch out for when looking for new rigs. I enjoy them..keep up the good work.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Great video and very informative üëçüèª... I have 95 c4 corvette has rough idel and makes a pinging popping sound... I have changed 02 SENSORS, EGR, TPS, IAC, MAP SENSOR and the sensor that screws into the front of the waterpump... but it still runs the same.... any ideas? Please don't say it's the Optispark... Lol"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty keep doing a great job!  Don't worry what fanboys are crying about.  Dodge/Ram are regularly near the bottom of the list of reliability.  Occasionally you can get lucky with one that's been taken care of, so be it.  Overall, steer clear of Dodge/Ram.  Stats don't lie."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,THANK YOU!!  Doctor. Kilmer you always make my day. Your Videos are always the best. Rest your Arms and have a good CHRISTMAS.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"We have Ford, who couldn't figure out how to put a spark plug in an engine.
We have Chrysler, who could never figure out how to oil an engine.
And we have GM, who will never figure out how to time an engine."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I love my 2015 lonestar 1500, 5.7 Hemi ,no mechanical issues, rides like a dream, pulls my 5,500 lbs camper perfectly."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"merry christmas scotty, love your videos."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I have a 2012 Ram with 170k on it. Never had a problem other than the other Hemi tick...damn exhaust manifold bolts broke again.  That's the only issue I have had with mine.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"0:15
Even though he's wrong, but "" if there were a land of Morons, Scotty would be the King of Morons"" is pretty funny."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Hi Scott I don't always agree with you  but  I enjoy your enthusiasm and  knowledge  thankyou  and keep these videos  coming
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Ive seen them well over 200k running great still. And the yranny is a great one too!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"In the rust belt, especially, when I see a ""clean"" vehicle, I want to make sure WHERE IT CAME FROM! I ESPECIALLY want to make sure it didn't come from down South and swam with the little fishies. That's ALWAYS my first question when looking at ANY (especially clean) vehicle; where did it come from? I want a history check; # of owners, miles driven per owner and how long owner owned it. I've had bad looks when these questions are asked. Also, make sure seller is the actual OWNER ON PAPER, not someone supposedly ""selling it for a friend""."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Good reverse call out on that guy. Scotty's the man.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"If there was a place called Priceless Ville, Scotty would be Lord of it. Scotty, your opinions and knowledge are truly priceless. Even ""if"" you don't care for Fiat's Dodgeball Rams. Keep it up. We need your blessedly biased input."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Love your channel man! Keep it going!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Good on you Scotty thanks , always pays to buy second hand car off someone you know if possible ,have a 1985 MQ patrol ute , for 2o plus years know both original owner s ,it lives at the beach if you want cars near Salt to last you have to rinse em off with fresh water under body etc couple times a week ,or just park it over a lawn sprinkler ,so not to waste the water"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I don‚Äôt trust him with any thing I‚Äôll own. Mechanic speaking ü§£
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"It's good that you had a decent RAM truck.  You showed the pros and cons of the truck, good or bad versions.  You're warning your followers and customers what to avoid and go for.  No morons here."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Always just telling it like it is. No secret agenda, which is rare now. 
‚ù§ for the politically INcorrect!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"This is going to shock the entire industry, and I'm mad as hell"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Iv driven pretty much everything when it comes to trucks, turbo ect, each with their ups and downs. But my favorite was a Dodge 2500 4x4 short. In the winter doing plow work it performed the best at that time. It could hold a whole skid of salt in the back of the bed plus a salt spreader along with a Big Max V plow on the front. That hemi had plenty of push power . The truck itself had ridiculous turn radius especially backwards. Anybody that plows  knows what I mean. It wasn't some big ridiculous oversized dually with turbos, but it got it done. The only big issue was yes as Scotty mentioned in the video and me living in Ohio if you did not clean those trucks off within 2 to 3 seasons The quality of the metal would literally disappear right in front of you from the salt lol."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,When I moved to the US for a while and was looking for a car I asked a repair shop what not to buy. Immediately the answer came back: Any Dodge/Chrysler. Because the engines were poorly made with narrow oilways that sludged up.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I am a huge fan of how Scotty's laughs are so well paired with the appropriate animal that would make that sound, lmao........so good."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"I had a 2014 Ram1500 5.7. It was running great at 93,000mi. Insane power. I ran Amsoil in it to try to avoid the tick. Apparently something worked, bc it didn't tick. The trans started slipping intermittently starting at 58,000 miles though. It would slip from 1st to 2nd when it was cold. The dodge garage was useless in fixing it, so I just ran it that way. Towed great though. A semi truck tanker rolled over it and crushed it in 2020 in my parking lot, so I didn't worry about the transmission issues after that."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty u have the absolute best info and honesty which is what matters. And lots of things come down to how a person drives and how well you take care of the mechanical things. However dodge after 2007 I would be very hesitant plus the new stensntis ownership oouch. No thank you. I'll keep my old school stuff and rebuild lots of it. Better than it was off the assembly line. Good info again.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Just ignore the rude comments and spend your time with the constructive ones.  Thanks for making these videos.  I'm learned a lot by watching them.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Scotty knows his stuff!üëç
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Scotty is pissed and I, like the auto industry, am shocked!"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Yup‚Ä¶Scotty was right.  Don‚Äôt buy a Dodge vehicle!  I learned the hard, and expensive, way."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Most esteemed and respected Sir, Thank you for posting your much needed help. I have a Honda vehicle, and your excellent advice has helped me immensely. Its a 2002 Odyssey,  it starts up every day and gets me to work. The code of PO740 pops up occasionally.  It's all good though"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,My nephew had his charger RT eat its cam after 10K miles of purchasing it as a used car.  He got a new engine for it from a company that claims to have potentially solved the issue.  I'm skeptical.  However the new engine will see A LOT of heavy idle time due to his work.  Yes it's the 09 + VVT Eagle head MDS Hemi too.  His is an '11.   We'll see.  Personally I'd rather have a Ram with the 300 + hp HO 4.7.
2,eBRsSGCi13E,I always stomp on the gas every now and then to make sure everything gets lubed up real good
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"It is because prices have ""gone bananas"" as you say Scotty I sold my Passat to a dealer and got $5800 and gained my mother's Nissan.  It is a 2017 Rogue Sport SV and it has the CVT you despise so much."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Hey, It's better to be pissed off not pissed on... unless your in Japan. Scotty is ACE and there are people that just can't handle the truth."
2,eBRsSGCi13E,You cant beat a pre emissions Dodge Ram with a Cummins! Scotty! For power and torque!
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Great job on keeping it clean and tidy. üòÇ
2,eBRsSGCi13E,"Don't listen to that guy Scotty.. I bought a 2017 ram hemi. In 2016 I bought it with 9,900 miles on it. Transmission went out at 10100. Thank God the dealership has a 3-month lemon law we will fix or take back. I gave it back I got my money back worst truck I've ever bought. I mean they're fancy and have all these great gadgets inside. I'm happy with my Toyota tundra now"
2,eBRsSGCi13E,Also the previous owner of my ram had the truck programmed for 87 octane or whatever....but I put everything back to stock and I do believe the tick went away
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Heating can be controlled from steering wheel and annoying beeps and loud indicator sound can be fixed in settings. Props to my local dealer - he‚Äôd watched all the YouTube reviews and it was the first thing he told me when I took a test drive. It‚Äôs excellent and I want one!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I know you love your exotics Rory but your reviews of lesser cars are outstanding - your understanding of what real people want is something most testers miss.üëç
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"The heating control is just on/off (it says that on the button).
Press the top of the screen (where the temp is shown) or swipe down and you'll get a set of controls that don't disappear (or use the button on the steering wheel).

All models have parking sensors at the rear (not at the front though)."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Just test drove one today, really great car! When you look at the price it‚Äôs an amazing EV"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Oh, dear. Legacy marques could really be in the crap now. An affordable electric car that's not only adequate for most people, but actively desirable in many ways."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Rory, loving your work as ever. I‚Äôve seen several top reviews for this car but I‚Äôm worried because it‚Äôs so cheap, that it‚Äôs NCrAP rating is minus 19 because it‚Äôs made from tinfoil? Discuss.."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Nice car. I could see myself in one - but ¬£30K isn't cheap, and the standard model sounds very different."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"you can program the rh star button to control the climate control. I've got the SR model (with LFP battery) and I don't have the same issues about the infotainment system. it's not perfect and many functions reset on every start up, software update needed."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Having tried this car I agree it's pretty good for the money, but it's not helpful to potential buyers to get some of the facts wrong, ie the price, the wheel size and boot comparison size with other makes. Just correct it in the edit as others do."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"You forgot to mention the fact that there's no rear central headrest... Quite a dealbreabker for a 2022 car and the cheap cost of putting one of those. The risk in case of an accident is quite high if you don't have a headrest. For my family it's probably the dealbreaker that crosses out this car, sadly, because we love it"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Another great review Rory, good balanced test."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Love that Rory's embracing this economy drive, what with the cheap MG and the Salvation Army jeans, he's really setting a good example for the rest of us...üòâ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Really good presentation Rory! Especially with the plastic cover and all the good and bad things!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks great. Love the concept and it's a step in the right direction. But, we need to see something reasonably priced with 300 miles range on a cold wet motorway drive üëç
I'm sure with the Chinese arrival in force it'll happen."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Rejected mine due to the oil leak and warped under tray plus all the other issues like over sensitive ‚Äòsafety‚Äô features. 
The storage bits in the rear of the front seats are only in the Trophy model.
Car drove really well and rapid charging speeds were faster than claimed, saw 143kW charging!
Not very efficient, 3.8mi/kWh where my Ioniq 38 was getting 5.4mi/kWh driven over the same route at the same time."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Raining and no rear wash wipe.
See the irony?
The lack of this useful safety related feature fitted for YEARS gives a peak into the odd minds of the decision makers inside MG 
Fashion won over practicality and common sense.
Unforgivable.
And Rory why didn't you call them out on this?
And that beeping, heating controls etc..designed to distract the driver.
Good grief
A fine design ruined by stupidity."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Seen one yesterday and it looked better than on pictures or video.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"While there is no question that MG has come out swinging for the fences and have succeeded in doing so, the non-cancelling driver aids and that insanely annoying constant beep is unacceptable. One shouldn't have to cancel it every time one gets in a vehicle. It should always be a choice of whether one wants that extra protection. Many of us actually focus entirely while behind the wheel and don't require a nanny to tell us off when we decide to take an apex and swing out a little wide because we can see there is the space to do so. If I were forced to own one, I would dig around to find the bastard beeping at me and beat the crap out of him until he stfu. =)"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Another great review Rory, Top man!! But, I'll stick with my Diesel all the same."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,180 actual miles vs a claimed 280 mile range! Constant bleeping when you‚Äôre driving! No parking sensors on the top range model! Do not buy this car until these basic ‚Äòproblems‚Äô are solved by the Chinese manufacturer!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Motorized vents have been standard on Teslas for years - did I miss something?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"I've been waiting for you to do this one Rory, an I've heard a lot of good talks about it."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Nice video! But there were some errors and missing information, I just got a MG4 Trophy so I can confirm you first hand the following:
1) AirCon: you use that button under the screen to turn it on/off,  you pressed it twice because it was already on. You can access to that aircon screen touching the upper part of the screen, where temperature and fan speed are always shown, or from the climate button on the right side of the screen in the home menu. Using one of those two ways the screen will stay on climate setting, so you'll have all the time you want. Also the right star button on the steering wheel allows you to control temp and fan from there. Buttons are easier to operate but it's not that bad
2) 17"" alloys
3) drowsiness alert is the one beeping, is a known problem and MG is releasing soon an OTA soon, that's what my dealer told me when I collected the car few days ago. You can turn it off and it will stay off when you restart the car, same for lane keeping assist and preference on star button. Although regen and driving mode will reset to 3 (max) and Normal and the restart, that's annoying and I hope they will fix it as well
4) Regen has also the ""auto"" setting, changing the regen intensity according to speed
5) I didn't try to get 0-60 mph as fast as I could but it should be less than 8 seconds (you said 7 in the video). Anyway is pretty quick and the rear wheel drive gives it a really sporty feeling 
6) on the Trophy there are sensors at the back for sure, if you put it in reverse it will show you them in addition to the camera views. Not completely sure on the front, but you have a good idea where the front of the car is, so doesn't bother too much.

Anyway, I think it's a really good car, great experience for me so far, go and have a test drive by yourself, it's worth it."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Excellent review, always enjoyed Rory on what I reckon was the dream team on Top Gear with him, Chris and Matt.

The infotainment seems a bit shonky, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fixable with an update. 

You can‚Äôt touch the value though, and also worth noting you could actually buy one of these today if you wanted, not an option for the majority of cars, particularly EVs."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Another great review rory !  üî•
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"This electric car ALMOST makes sense. 26K SUV, 200 miles of range. On a 4-5 year PCP it's almost affordable and if you have a driveway and charge ports installed then I suspect people will be tempted. We still need a 15K electric hatch back with 250-300 miles of range and more charging stations. But this car, nearly gets there at 26K. The problem is, you can buy a second hand SUV for 6K, you own the car and it's still cheaper to run overall during your ownership."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£25,995 starting price, not 24 ...  and 17"" wheels ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

I have an SE SR in Camden Grey ... and I love it. üôÇ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"*""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.""* ---Winston Churchill"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Love this guy's reviews.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"I picked our Trophy, in Volcanic Orange, up last week, very impressed and i've got a Tesla Model Y. The wife loves her new car and all the family are impressed."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"nice one Rory. Pity here in South Africa so far the cheapest EV is the Mini and Haval (introduced about 2 months ago) the rest are still out of reach for average consumer (Porsche, BMW, Merc, Audi and Volvo). Will eventually get there"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"A few tips for you, you can set the car to enable the heating controls from the steering wheel. You can turn the beeps OFF for the driver awareness system and they don't turn back on after restart. The wheels are 17"" not 18"".
Otherwise, I agree with everything he said, it's a great car to drive at exceptional value."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,My Fiat 500e also used to regularly provide similar over-cautious warning messages they have diminished with time.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Thanks for the thorough review!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"id love one, they will be every where surely on a cheap lease"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"*sigh* 
It does have rear parking sensors, only the drivers seat is electric, and the heating controls are accessed in a variety of ways, none of which are double tapping the button! 

(also you have the earlier version with the annoying 'driver fatigue' sensor on the steering wheel which was removed a while ago.)

What MG DO need to fix is that the driver assist functions stay turned off when they're disabled. Some of mine do.. and some don't!

I'm also getting about 3.5 miles per kwh motorway driving in 5 degree weather wind and rain. Happy with that!"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The only Company who can rival and out perform MG in terms of good value for money product is BYD.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,If this car had a android automotive it'd be amazing
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"If I was in the market, I'd be tempted to take a good look at this ..."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,WARNING: I work in the port of Zeebrugge where many new cars arrive and are moved between docks all day. I‚Äôve never seen so many cars break down as the MG‚Äôs. Often seen multiple per day on the side of the road with a technician with it. So there is clearly a reliability issue somewhere‚Ä¶
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Until the end of the video where you said this might be the best FAMILY car for the price, I swear I thought it was a small hatchback."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"It's really a beautiful car..! üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ù§Ô∏è From Bangladesh üáßüá©"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"I gotta say, from the front it kinda gives off Lambo Urus vibes. Great review !"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Hopefully MG can update them for the weird beeps and software issues like the climate
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Having no true One Pedal driving is a deal breaker for me. It's the best thing about driving an EV in the city
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Fantastic Review - thanks Rory.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"U caught me with the intro, plus awesome video as usal, keep up the great work."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"No rear wipers & they can't put in reversing camera as standard , even though it would probably only cost less than ¬£5"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"""teslas dont need it...SHUT UP!!"" ü§£ü§£"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks like an Urus if you blink a lot, surround it with thick fog and you have a chronic eye condition. For the price point, fine way to get on EV scene for cheap and avoid the taxi man prius"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"At 25K, it's almost affordable on a 4-5 PCP. This should sell well."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Nice video. Never seen 14s review before.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Ordered a trophy model in white. Pick it up first week in Jan
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"A generally good review but quite a few wrong facts...

Rory says they start at at ¬£24999...actually it's ¬£25995 for the SE..he says the Trophy is ""just over ¬£30,000"" ...it's actually ¬£31,495 for the blue or white and increasing extras for the other colours up to ¬£35190 for the orange as tested....a bit more than ""just over ¬£30000""....still excellent value though

Instead of pressing the button at the bottom to bring up the HVAC screen and it disappearing after 2 seconds...just press the very top of the screen where it shows AC and the temp display and you will find the screen stays on all the time.

It does have rear sensors...on my Trophy, as well as the rear cam view being displayed, it also beeps with increasing urgency the nearer you get to an obstacle ...just like normal rear sensors.

Had mine 3 weeks and loving it so far. :)"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I like your humour. hubcap and open the roof great. Is the voice control also on the standard 51 kWh version?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The Lambo+prius+clio thing ü§Æ .p.s. nice stearing wheel
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Waiting for the sedan version...
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"There are a lot of pluses, but that beeping would drive me nuts after a while and what no climate control knobs! That is simply dangerous. The weather in this country can change in minutes. You can't be looking at a touch control screen to adjust the temperature. Definitely a deal breaker for me."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"MG has quickly become one of the best-selling brands in the Middle East, even beating out big-wigs like Toyota and Chevrolet in certain segments. In no time, MG will once again become a household name in the UK."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Well done, Thank you very much."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£32k for trophy, cheap? Cheaper than EV rivals but not a cheap car. That word brings bad connotations. It‚Äôs a proper car better than most petrol hatches. Shows how cars need to be made if we are to go fully electric and reduce emissions, ha the irony."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,isnt Dacia Spring the cheapest on the market?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Cheap? Immediately rules out the vast majority of the driving population. The trickle down of affordable used electric cars is years away for most people and then they will have to contend with the battery degradation. Questionable if its an ethical purchase given its origin.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"FYI guys, ‚Äòfake leather‚Äô is now called ‚Äòvegan leather‚Äô these daysü§£"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The front end is clearly inspired by the C8 Corvette and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not actually that bad
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Why would anyone pay 25k for this shizzle when you can buy used cars which are top spec. Insurance doesn‚Äôt differ that much as well if you have enough experience. And if money was really a problem you wouldn‚Äôt be paying for a new car, you‚Äôd be buying a used (2 to 5 yr old) car. So insurance increase of 100 or 2-300 shouldn‚Äôt be that much dent."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Love watching this dude ! We've got ours lol. But umm the car is a nope lol
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"It's beeping because you're a crap driver! üòÑ. The sports model will feature a sunroof, camera door mirrors and 4 wheel drive - with two motors that'll propel it to 60mph in around 3-4 seconds."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I hear people say they don't like the design but in person they're a real head turner at the moment. I imagine that will fade with its success.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Poor old Rory going from a TTRS iconic to an MG lmao
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Great review
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Looks nice
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The hight of the car is perfect for the speed bumps in this country lol

2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Great review by Rory, I very much like how he reported the usability limitations with the infotainment system.  Balanced.
Things like that would drive me crackers I think, but that aside what a statement of intent by Chinese automakers!"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,A true driver don‚Äôt need parking sensors üòÇ and yes the beeps are annoying but I love the car.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I hope everyone in the comment section owns their dream car one day.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,First glance at the thumb nail I thought it was a lambo üòÖüòÖ
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Just tell the range, charging time, and price. That is all that matters. It is not a bad cat, but I wouldn't buy it just because the beeping can't be switched off."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£25,000-¬£31,000 ‚Äòcheap‚Äô for a small car even if it is an EV?! üòÇ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Quite snappy looks, but that colour....!  Oh dear. I just realized what that shade reminds me of.  The colours of British Leyland cars in the early/mid 1970's.  The Orange that sat alongside the Chocolate Brown, Lurid Limes et al."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Starts at ¬£25,995. ""A little over ¬£30k"" well it's 7% more than ¬£30k starting at ¬£32,040.00"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Commooon Rory...I've got electrically controlled seats in a vintage benz I just bought. Make me understand why i should fork out 30 big ones for this?!

2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Great host!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"The boot is not bigger than the boot of an ID3. And not sure about the 0-60 time you mention. Other reviewers say the seats are too soft and not supporting. I hate the rear design, but this car could definitely become a game changer. Great value for money."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,We need this car in America. It would sell out completely.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"So you grinded a car, jumped it at 160mph, got a jet, jumped a helicopter, had CLEETUS in vid, HYDROPLANED A CAR. This is absolutely nuts"

2,LXzPkkQirnM,"There are two different types of Gymkhana: Ken and his absolute precision driving, then Travis with his on the ragged edge stunt-filled runs. Both are excellent in their own ways and great to watch."

2,LXzPkkQirnM,The amount of pure skill from everyone involved and how they all handle their machines. This is why I love this series. Look forward to it every year.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"I have been on youtube since the beginning, this has to be one of the most crazy and spectacular videos i've ever seen. I'm just sitting here in PURE AWE, the creativity and danger it's a complete package. Travis, you're a genius!! Thank you Hoonigan for making this happen, excited to see the next project <3"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Would love a behind the scenes. Just to see how much work and effort this took, I'm sure there was a lot of takes"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Absolutely off the chart! Nice work to everyone involved, Travis Rocks! cool to see Cleet's cameo and I'd love to see a ""Making Of"" follow up that could last for hours!  : )"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Ok I'm going to go ahead and say it, This is my favorite gymkhana. Between helicopter jumps, Cleetus cameo, and Travis' ""I don't have to pay for this"" driving style."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Travis: misses the guard rail by a few inches 
Also Travis: hits the curb"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Completely insane stuff! I can not imagine the amount of preparation that goes into something like this. The bridge jump over the helicopter was nuts!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Dude, you could play something like this in the theaters and I would gladly pay. That was fucking insane!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,23 years later and this dude still doing crazy ass shit üòÇ

Boy was I wrong üòÇ"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This is an insane video. Loved it! When he sent the car full blast over the bridge i couldn't believe it. Awesome work!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Listen just when you think this man can show you nothing new‚Ä¶ well god like he does! Nobody will ever replace this man! NOBODY! The talent is unmatched. It takes months of planning and practice to bring us a 15 minute video!! Thanks Pastrana!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"As much as we pay attention and watch Travis with his driving skills, we also need to give props to everyone behind the scenes. The permits they have to pull to shut down these streets. All the camera men and women, everyone involved in making these amazing, so entertaining, finger biting videos. Congrats to everyone involved and thank you for your hard work!!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"By FAR the best Gymkhana ever made. From the car to the stunts, everything is just perfect. That 160mph jump had me jaw dropped. 
One thing I would have loved to see (if it's possible) would be the angle from a 360 camera attached to one of the heli blades during the jump. A slowed down angle from that perspective would have been insane. 
THANK YOU HOONIGAN AND KEN BLOCK !"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"This was crazy, loved every second of it"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I would love to watch every camera angle on this run. Amazing
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This was absolutely one of the sickest car videos I've ever seen. TRAVIS is a truly skilled Savage! üî•üî•üî•üôå
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This was so unreal.. The stunts were impossible.. First time I've seen this stunt in gymkhana. I can't wait to see the next one. üí™.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,WOW another filming and driving masterpiece !!!!! Love the creativity and fun
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"4:52 this really shows you how well they built this car, a normal vehicle would have gotten f‚Äôed up beyond belief from this impact at that speed"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"So sick man love these things!!! Makes my day every time, keep up the good work yall,  God bless"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Big wow moment seeing Cletus in mullet but my jaw dropped seeing that 160mph jump over a bridge üòÆ
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This video was freaking insane thanks to everyone that made this video possible enjoyed every minute of it.üëçüî•üî•üî•
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Travis was a madman on this one, I love it! Would you mind telling us the damage on the GL wagon? And maybe selling it to me? üòÇ"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"That helo jump was insane! The jump before that looked sketchy as hell too, if it wasn't for trav and his special setup that car probably woulda just nosed right over end over end!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Absolutely insane!

Would love to see a feature length movie of stunts and tomfoolery"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"The amount of skill shown by all the parties, from the monster truck , the chopper, the jetski, the jet pilot,  the editors and travis himself is insane!!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,So epic. Another great video. Cleetus was just the icing on the cake. üëåüèº
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Awesome video, especially bringing in some other heavy hitters.   Awesome to see the Florida Man show up to the line!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"One of the awesomest vids I've ever watched. 10 mins felt like 2, and what an awesome Subaru."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"I need a minute for all to sink in, this was insanely amazing!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Probably the most creative Gymkhana video yet. That 165 mph bridge jump and ""pond"" crossing were wild!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"the planning and logistics seem intense, so many more things could have gone wrong. Cracked pelvis is pretty severe but that's probably one of the lesser mishaps that could have gone wrong."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Soon he'll need a bionical full body replacement to keep on being adrenaline junkie. So sick man! The sickest Gymkhana yet imo. Also Garrett cameos!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,That first big send....oh....my....god.....this video was incredibly enjoyable! Great job to the hoonigan squad!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Travis, now thats something else...........from watching you in your early Mx racing days to the insane driver youve become...... Hats off to you from the UK........ youre the Man."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This is probably the most Hoonigan Ain't Care Gymkhana yet. The absolute commitment from Travis and the thrashing of that beautiful wagon is unparalleled.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This is an absolutely incredible video! Everything about this is mind blowing. I fucking love it.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I am so happy Cleetus made it into this! Can‚Äôt be a Florida man without him!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"This was so sick 
Ken block knows how to make a race video i love it good choice on using pastrana / love how u saw cleetus  to race randomly"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"WHAT AN EPIC AWESOME VIDEO!!!! üôåüèªüî• Hoonigan, how are you folks going to ‚ÄòTop‚Äô this one?! Not one jump, but three! Man!!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,The level of carnage that wagon endured had me laughing at every single hard hit it took! Genuinely entertaining Gymkhana!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I am so thrilled you mentioned the SVX in this video! That was my very first car and I absolutely adored it
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Perfect example of Hoonification! Ken Block will always be a slayer but damn does TP push the limits. Not to mention the 1/4 mile burn out by the Florida man himself in mullet.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Can we just take a second to rewatch that helli V car, nose to nose screen at the end ! What a pilot (and of course Travis) ü§Ø"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"4:51 WOW!! 140+ mph over that first jump?!?!? that's the actual definition of ""sending it"" ü§£.. also I don't know where this was filmed but BIG props to the state and county that helped make this video happen! We appreciate truly appreciate it bc these videos are just awesome and u thinkable 15-20 years ago"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,That was one of the coolest sickest things I‚Äôve ever seen absolutely amazing and you have some seriously large‚öΩÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏èüëçüèºü§©‚ù§Ô∏è
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Definitely a very good video he is very talented he always has been and he just hit a jump at probably more than 165 miles an hour on pavement! he's got balls of adamantium Steel lol
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"I'm so glad to see the man, the myth, the legend! I'm talking of course of the one & only Florida Man: Cleetus McFarland üòÇüòÅüòáü§ü"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"What can i say... It's crazy as f*ck. Great job Travis. The Jumps and the grind are absolut crazy... A Jet, Helicopter, Grave Digger and all the other stuff was awesome."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I think  I want a wagon now
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Mano tu √© muito bravo belio Meos parab√©ns de cora√ß√£o Deus te aben√ßoe sempre
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This is NUTS I love it! Didn't want the video to end!!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I love the guest appearance of mullet and cleetus! Great video!!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Travis is living the dream, minus all the injuries... Such a sick video"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,At 3:50 watching cleet rocket up to Travis and pass right at the turn was a beautiful shot. Awesome
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I feel bad saying this was the best Gymkhana because I love watching Ken ripping it but it really was the best one yet!  Incredible!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Mans was so calm about that smack into the ground üòÇüòÇ. ""Maybe the pelvis, a little internal stuff."" I'll never understand how some people have such a high pain tolerance. That aside, this has to be the coolest footage to ever be produced."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,5:48 honestly kinda disappointed that they didn't get whistling diesel and Monster Max II (2) in that clip. It would have been insane with just the sheer size.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"And there was me thinking ""how does travis top the 150mph+ jump from last time"".... Well thanks for answering. GREAT Gymkhana! Best one so far."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Cleetus making an appearance was a huge surprise! Epitome of a Florida man. You guys really went full send on this one. Think it's the hardest I've seen one of the gymhana cars get sent. Well done
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Wow what a show that was awesome these guys are insane hahaha üòÖI think this is my favourite gymkhana so far üòÖ
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Thank you Travis for verifying the new and last wrx. I had my doubts but it‚Äôs still pretty damn cool-
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"The hammering that car took, this some impeccable engineering"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Ken watching this must be sweating bullets lol. Doubt anyone ever could top this! Insane run!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"This is a beautiful marriage between the absolute animals from Nitro Circus and the scumbags at Hoonigan...  Truly a new level of epic: rail grind, Cleetus, water skim..so many great moments...will be watching many times!  Hope Travis is ok.."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"In a scene with Travis, making donuts under a helicopter, I was sure the heli will hook his car up and carry to a next gymkhana sector."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,The jump at 4:51 was absolutely insane!!ü§Ø
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"Absolutely crazy what you‚Äôre doing üòÇ
Whats the advantage of using such an old car compared to a new one? 
Just a preference? I know not a single bolt on there is stock btw"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,This brought me back to when the first one was made Jaw in full shock camera angles different variety . Wild jumps & funny clips ! So sick !!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,To clarify: The guys at Hoonigan are not just on another level. They ARE the level. Everything about this entire production is just absurdly perfect.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Just when I thought this shit couldn't get any cooler...they drop this. Miss you Ken! We want you both in a dual.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,you guys are so damn crazy xD I LOVE IT
2,LXzPkkQirnM,How fast was he taking those jumps? Like wtf bro. That gave me chills
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Did not expect it to be at this level. This is the coolest Gymkhana film. This is insane!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"First comment while watching: ""This man just Freaking 50-50'ed a car.""

I absolutely love how different of a vibe this one was. Gymkhana is always a treat - but incredible to see you guys innovate to this day. Killer work!"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"This thing was great,, Great Build,, Awesome machine,, I would like one of those.."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Fair play to the helicopter pilot for resisting any temptations between the jump
2,LXzPkkQirnM,HOW FAST was he going when he hit that first bridge jump? Was he still full throttle from the previous shot? Absolutely FLYING lol
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Sempre Magn√≠ficos.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"I like how Travis has brought his own style to the Gymkhana universe. Ken's style was always about proximity, Travis' is about the jumps."
2,LXzPkkQirnM,i laughed out loud at the cleetus part. i loved it!!! this video is amazing. great job as always
2,LXzPkkQirnM,What an amazing video. What skill pastrana has üëäüèª
2,LXzPkkQirnM,That moment you realize that if your in a car and think about taking off on a good helo pilot! Oof.  You can tell he was military trained. Best of the best. So glad cleeter got in! He is Florida right now!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,3:17 that active aero looks insane
2,LXzPkkQirnM,As soon as i seen mullet and Cletus i literally yelled NO SHOT!!! This was way cool dudes!! Major props to Scotto and the team for this killer 10 mins of awesomeness
2,LXzPkkQirnM,"4:55 Imagine something goes wrong in this jump. Landing on too much front angle, missing the road, bridge. That could end up very badly. Good to see that nothing happened and He is still alive"
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I just wanna ask: which freaking Subaru model is thisüòÆ. Hats off to the whole team and  Travis for making this amazing video!‚ù§
2,LXzPkkQirnM,The dude has officially become immortal. Borderline demi-god after his last Subaru performance. BUT GOD DAMN
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Travis killed it in this ken you got to step it up Travis is getting pretty damn good!!
2,LXzPkkQirnM,Love how you guys continue to get creative while still having some classic shots like the moving donuts. Travis is such a monster. Those stunts were so scary and he just send it every time.
2,LXzPkkQirnM,I had to replay those bridge jumps like five times that was freaking bananas
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Very Sad. Original Louvers Were Repairable. No More For Me.
  Good Luck With The Channel."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"It not only super interesting skilled work to learn from a pro, but also the humor and skill in handling ‚Äústuff‚Äù is extraordinary!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Leaving the hardener tube in really brought that panel back to factree...very impressive!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"LMAO!!!  This has been a great repair video series, Kyle! Sorry for you loss of ‚Äúfootage‚Äù, great thinking on the fly tho!
Keep‚Äôem coming‚Ä¶.. we‚Äôll keep watching, learning and laughing!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, the precision work you did on that original cowl vent panel was fantastic !!!  I guess it's easy to criticize a true craftsman like you.  Your videos are great and I look forward to every new addition. Keerp up the good work.  A+++++++++"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, I'm so happy you are in anger management. I've noticed a big change lately. The way you handled the louver situation is incredible!! I'm so proud of you!!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"After doing this for over 45 years myself I can relate, about .5% of the population would have ever noticed...  

Why I watch you and many others is because of the little ""golden nugget "" you pick up even watching something I have done hundreds of times. 

Other peoples opinions are why I doubt doing  YOUTUBE would work for me and why I tip my hat to you just doing your own thing and blowing of some steam with the main joke and the inside joke ;)   well played sir."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Hey boss! Another educational tutorial... I hadn't thought of leaving the tube of hardener in the bondo; I always pick up some valuable tips! Cheers buddy!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Always impressed with the work it takes to get the inner panels and fitment on the overlaying panels correct. Great job as always. Especially appreciated the special notice on getting all the bolts in and tight to assure proper reassembly.. üëå
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"That was a good tip about using tig rod with the mig welder to help plug up holes. I hadn't seen that before. The snow won't be around that much longer, it should be gone by June."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Well that was a very interesting video.  I thought the repair on the cab corner was excellent. I had to go back in the video and look at your first louver repair so I could compare it to the original.  I could definitely see the difference between the two.? I thought the sledge and bondo repair would have been sufficient but to each his own. Oh by the way I'm so glad the anger management is working for you.  Truck is coming along really well.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Looking forward to many future videos. Thanks for sharing your incredible rebuilds, repairs, and welding skills. I am certain that I am not alone in appreciating your dry humor and sarcasm. Keep up the great work!üòÄ"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Hey Cheers to you Carter! You and Scott are in a class well above many. I had to resort to making my own patch panels for my old Supra and talented people like yourselves gave me the courage to tackle the project. Keep up the fine work and teaching.
Btw you had me snarfing in my tea with your bondo demo!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Looking good, can't wait to see you put the corner windows in."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Always enjoy watching your channel,  it's so informative on what you're doing. You made the right choice with changing the loovers in front of the door. Nothing like oem equipment. Keep up the great work Kyle. Looking forward to the next video üëç"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"i was a little bit surprised that the damage on the back of the cab reappeared, but that‚Äôs what it takes i guess, one step forward and seven steps backwards. glad you‚Äôre in anger management and i hope you‚Äôll reach a full 100% angrier by next year. hopefully i can contribute to your demise! loving the progress by the way!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Amazing job on that louver grafting. One of my favorite videos of yours is repairing those louvers in place on a similar truck. So much patience and skill. You've really given me inspiration for my rusty '54 5 window project. I don't think I'll ever match your prowess with the bondo and spatula though.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I think those factory louvers were the right call.  Absolutely perfect in every way and the countless hours you spent to go that extra mile will certainly pay off when this truck is at Pebble Beach.  You can't even tell where you grafted it in over what the replacement panel looked like so definitely a great job!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Just in the past week my wife and I rescued the body of a 1951 3100 Chevrolet from sitting on the ground for over 30 years in the forest. It is very rough and it should be scraped but i can't do it. I want to thank you because of your videos you have inspired me to tackle trying to fix this old truck and save from it dissappearing for ever. Please keep making these videos you are such a great teacher, I've been sharing your videos with so many people. Thank you so much"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"The Louvres straightened out nicely.   Looks like you‚Äôve picked up the bog / filling method from Boyde Coddington‚Äôs boys.  

Nice hole filling technique by the way.  I‚Äôve filled a good number of holes in my time, and that‚Äôs a technique that I‚Äôve never used.  I‚Äôll give it a try as soon as possible."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Dad and I are dying laughing over this video. ü§£ My dad particularly remembers watching the one episode of Dee Dees filler work and had to wipe tears from his eyes laughing so hard. Even though it sucks you went to Hollywood, I guess we‚Äôll keep on watching you! üòâ love your content as always, brother! Your craftsmanship and humor is well appreciated!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Hi Kyle:  That is a great tip using the TIG rod as filler.  I have been using a slab of copper when I can position it behind the panel but now, I know what to do for the inaccessible areas!  Thanks!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Love the new narration-over-action format! Works great! Also, it seems to me a good partnership of your expert work combined with existing stamp-formed substitute panels -- it makes better use of expert time."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"You are THE master of the cheese grader! So glad that anger management has worked out for you soo well. . oh and hey. . .that grinding job was second to no one! Love this channel, so glad coldwarmotors recommended you!!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, I wish I could subscribe over and over for that burst of nonverbal creative invective.  Not only did I learn useful welding technique and the logical approach to getting a satisfactory result from proper body/frame setup but you took such a hard surprise turn into absurdist comedy that it was a true gift, Xmas came early here!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Always enjoy your videos.  I've got a 1948 International truck with a roof that looks like someone did a Mexican hat dance on. I'm hoping to pick up enough knowledge to make some acceptable repairs to it. Thanks for all your hard work.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Looks great, nice to see a person who knows metal fabrication and metal finish, impressive"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,As always. Nice work. I'd love to see that cab mounted and completely finished.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, you took a twisted mangled mess and straightened it out into its former glory that's for sure. Kudos to you."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"As always, another awesome video Kyle. Totally enjoy your videos. Keep the videos coming for they keep me riveted to either the phone or TV. Which ever I'm closer to. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the YouTube community! Totally dig the channel. Definitely a lifetime subscriber. Keep On Keeping On Brother!!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Amazing metal work as always I was wondering when you were going to slip in some bondo  work  I picked up some very useful tips
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I actually liked the look of the aftermarket louvres but your dedication to perfection is beyond reproach.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,really enjoying this build  . Thanks for sharing your work
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Glad your anger management is going ok. Nice to see you recycling old cardboard boxes for bondo mixing. Not sure I have seen Dan spread bondo that way, but hey, I would not call you a liar! Actually your bondo spreading turned out really good in the end!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, you have a bright future in Hollywood.  Thank you for sharing your skills with us."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"If you hadn‚Äôt pointed out the difference in the louvers, I never would have noticed. They look just fine to me. Great work man."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Well, I love to see your kind of anger management! How you work on a vehicle is your business. Love the bondo work. The result Is stunning! Great work!üòÑ"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, I very much enjoyed the replacement of the replacement louvers. But in keeping with your policy about no sophisticated tooling, I would have not worn those expensive gloves to apply the bondo.  Seriously, I enjoy your videos. You are a not just a great metal man you are a great teacher. Thank you and good luck with the anger management. It never worked for me."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I'm reworking door jambs and hinges on a second run 55 Chevy 3100. My skills aren't perfect but improving. I appreciate all, any knowledge I can gain. You and Scott show I don't need the biggest, best and everything to achieve the end result. Thanks"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Congratulations Kyle on Corporate sponsorship from Bondo LTD.  It's about time you were rewarded for your talents!  Hope it doesn't change you! üòÜ
2,-tcYHpGPCss,My son and I recently bought a 52 Chevy 3100 short bed. It needs a bit of work in the cab corners and floor pans but other than that pretty solid. It seemed really daunting and we were starting to feel overwhelmed as we analyzed the work needed. After watching many of your videos we have the confidence we need to know we can tackle the body work. Thank you.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,When people tell me how to do something their way I just hand them the tools and leave. Love your videos and glad to see you getting more subs!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Nice work,  I always learn something from your videos.  I have been blessed with OCD and the louvers,  though an acceptable repair. would eventually get to me.... nothing beats original.  Very impressive work."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"It's nice to see you added Dan's ""Manitoba Method"" of filler work to your repertoire. I would have never imagined you could top the hot sauce method. The depth of your skill is truly astounding."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Happy to see that there's still a bit of the old Kyle üòÅ I can't believe how good you are and just wish I were closer to you - no problem for the $100/hr üòÇ
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Wow ! Those original louvers look almost as good as the replacement louvers.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I'm so happy that you have progressed with your anger management therapy...Your videos are now pure joy to watch...no more of that angry welding and grinding...and your hammer blows are so much more civilized...ü§£
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Laughed my a$$ off!!! Thanks for the humor AND all the pointers you threw in. 
No reason for me to stop watching. 
If others want to fix bad parts they should step up and offer to fix them for free.
AND pay for shipping both ways."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Dude. You had me dying when you put the old louvers back on. Great sense of humor. Love this channel. Keep it up.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I love your attitude towards the louvers!  Keep up with the great content, love your channel"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I love how you put the dent and rusty cab corner back in just for continuity!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Fabolous as usual!
That trick with the Tig rod, awesome to know, thx for sharing Kyle many of us so appreciate your videos so much üòä"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Great work once again   I would love to have that cab    Thanks for the cats
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Ah.. The clean floor was satisfying ! have been waiting for that for several episodes !  üòÇ. Keep em coming Kyle !
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Yes, that's much better now!
Do you have any trouble starting your helicopter when it's 40 below?"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle you are the BOSS and we are the viewers, So  do it your way,    What the Hell, who know how many dates your girlfriend had unless you tell.  I bet you could not tell by just looking.  Very educational  on repairing and saving it from the junk pile. Still watching and loving it."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Hey Kyle, I would have replaced them as well, keep up the beautiful work sir!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Nice to see you have honed your skills Kyle, keep up the good work man i will continue watching.üòéoh can you let me know where to get those Canadian Bondo spreaders you were using can‚Äôt find them here in the states.Thanks again"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,If never thought of using tig rod to fill up smaller holes. I just made some circle plugs from sheetmetal by tacking 1/8th inch rod to the sheetmetal and grinding it down to the right size and shape with my drill and die grinder.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Thanks for posting Kyle love everything you do and try commenting on your videos.at least I think I do  having turned 63 a couple of day's ago   I'm not sure now . I have no Idea  if you changed that panel but it looks Great to me.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Great work Kyle. Thanks for sharing with us.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle I was one of the few who watched the ‚Äúdud‚Äù video. I thought it was great! So much so that when you didn‚Äôt fix the factory louvres, I kinda was shocked, BUT, blindly trusting your judgment, I went along with the replacement panel! When you smashed that louvre panel on the floor I spit out my beer!!!ü§£ Seeing the factory louvres put in at the end, I have to admit, they do look better than the replacement panel. Again, your judgment was correct. The copper trick is a favorite of mine but I am going to try the tig rod trick. Thanks again for the great content!!!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Lol üòÇ, this was great! The bongo thing was hysterical, LMAO! Kyle your work is excellent, seriously. You are very talented and I would love to have you work on my vehicle. Thanks for the videos and I don‚Äôt know how you don‚Äôt have more subs. Have a great holiday."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Love the sarcasm! But, tell me, do you prefer a chainsaw or 12"" grinding disc for the louver finishing?"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Great video!  Love this channel..learning a ton. If haglers don't like it they should unsubscribe . If they don't like it go watch GraveYardCars or Chip Fosse and pay that bill. Another reason I do t take my car to a car show. To many people can't appreciate anything but a concourse restoration. My 2 cents.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I think the empty tube adds extra strength, I will try it out"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Excellent. If one can recall from a previous episode, I could be wrong, you were refurbishing this cab instead of restoring it. Apparently your viewers got the smashing of ""a louvre"" confused with the smashing of ""The Louvre"". Other than that it's looking great. Keep it Carter and keep it Canadian."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I think you are doing a fantastic job on this truck. I agree with you on the original louvers being a waste of time. Just ignore the keyboard auto body mechanics and keep doing the nice work you do.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Used to watch bad Chad quit when he used coat hangers. Did it when I was  12 and didn't know better. Hangers are made from poor grade steel plus coated. You're right on using wire intended for welding rather than hanging your clothes on. Another great video Kyle
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Nice work Kyle, I think you made the right decision on those louvers too. (wink-wink)üòâüòâ
Interesting take on ""anger management,  I guess managing anger doesn't have to  mean less anger?üëç"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, You know Dan is the Master of filler application üëçüëç, Glad to know you were trained by the Master!!, Awesome video as always man,now go collect that big Hollywood check and take it easy!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,love your work kyle  learn so much from your videos keep posting
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"The Russians have been using repaired factory louvers and bondo for years while in the west we have been using inferior replacement stamped panels.  Kyle, you have shown us here in the West that we can close the ‚Äúlouvre gap‚Äù with the Russians and learn to love the  Bondo."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I am so pleased you came to your senses and grafted the original louvers back inti the repair panel. 
You may find that using an actual cheese grater , yes the one from your neighbour‚Äôs kitchen, will speed up the process and most importantly get more views on the youtubes."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"That anger management BS is really working! I haven't laughed so much in a long time, thanks. Love you channel and will continue to watch whatever you put up."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Yes it's your truck do as you wish looks great so far well done
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Now that's dam good schmooing well played brother. DD speed shop for the win. You do a great job in my mind if that means anything to you and your knowledge is going to help the wife and I with our projects.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Great job Kyle as always!!!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Loved the D and D skit. At first i thought it was Bad Chad applying the fill. !!üòÇ awesome work Mr. Kyle!!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Beautiful work. Thanks for sharing.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Am an older person who would like to be able to do all that you do. Spent most of my time doing basic maintenance and engine work.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Hey Kyle.  So glad DDSS taught you that magic trick with Bondo, mate.  The original louvres look way better, although I still think you could have saved the use of Bondo a bit by using a bigger hammer and an anvil.....or maybe just an anvil dropped from 10 feet or so.  They aren't as heavy as they look, so you should be able to do that on the next project no problem.

Great to hear the anger management classes are going so well.  I could only manage to get 10% more angry after 10 minutes of the first session, so I walked out.  The restraining order they sent me was totally unnecessary as I have no intention of going back, but it did serve to get me that extra 5% of anger, so I guess they have a set target for any client no matter if the client sticks around or not.  Good on them - and I hope they appreciate the time it took me to set fire to their premises, with the cost of petrol being so high and all......

Seriously, it's cool to see the Youtube fraternity rising up against unnecessarily harsh comments that serve no purpose than to prove that the writer has no practical idea of the subject they are watching and nothing constructive to say.  There appears to be a lot of you guys doing it at the moment (well, at least of the channels I watch anyway) and you all do it in your own particular style (including DD Speed Shop!) using your own dry humour and it is the best policy against those whose sole aim seems to be to provoke a negative response.  Good on ya!

As to the truck cab - she's looking damn good now.  Looking forward to seeing that big GMC face go back on her.  I guess the props dept will be working overtime to make that happen while you sit in your dressing room on set.  I'll spare a thought for the effects team too - I did notice you got a bit close to the green screen in this episode (the one that shows the other car in your ""garage"").  All the best, my friend."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Brilliant title to another great romp through the wild and wacky world of metal repair. Thanks fer takin us along...
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Thank you for the Comic Relief, After a day in the workshop with 42 C degree temperature, I really needed a laugh. Keep up your fantastic work."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Kyle, Nice job, no matter what the ""arm chair"" body men say. Send Marilyn the damaged louvers C.O.D. And have her repair them to her satisfaction.  
Take care 
Rick"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I find it astounding that the company making the repop panels doesn't make the effort to duplicate the louvers perfectly.   How much more engineering would it have taken to get it right instead of ""good enough"" ?"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,What kind of sanding disc do you use on your hand drill there? Looks like it's really effective.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"My compliments to Cat Fab on the grafting of the louvers. ‚ÄúI lost the video of me doing it‚Ä¶‚Äù is an old saw used by many Hollywood actors. But, it works for you. Please leave the spiders alone. Cat Fab snacks on them during the long night shift. üò∏"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Lots of good tips and tricks as usual, great video."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Dang, You busted out the Bondo brand filler!!! Well done sir! Nothing but the best on that build right LOL :D
Great content man, Cheers"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I am so glad you reused old louvers! Wink Wink! I do not usually comment on videos. I‚Äôll leave that to the experts, BUT! I just want to say you do great work! I am doing the rear quarters, trunk floor, valance and light panel on a 69 charger. Would you like a plane ticket to Waco Texas? I have good tools and still having problems!!! Lol! Also we all should buy stock in bondo and the polishing compound DD Speed uses! Lol! Keep up great work and stop the anger classes so you can make more videos! Fu&@ Anger Management!"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Are you still going to add in the back corner windows or are the frames in too bad of shape? Good video again, I will watch for your next video."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Ha. After I wrote that, I went back to watching and was tickled to see you call it porcupine as well. I haven't really thought about the impurity issue but I definitely have noticed more to grind when I use something more or less the size of the hole. The tig wire definitely looks like it works better. Being a mediocre welder, I do an awful lot of grinding. I use my 7-in grinder far too much because I'm impatient."
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"I love your skills, I love your approach, I love your demeanor.
You are a true artistan and the incredibly high quality of your work speaks volumes. F**k anger management üòâüëç"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Good video! Mr. bean couldn't have done the bondo work any better himself!
2,-tcYHpGPCss,Maravilha top demais üëè
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"Loved the DD Speedshop reference, a contrast in ethos but equally valid"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,I really like your MIG/TIG technique.
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"It all looks the same to me. Glad your were able to ""fix it"". I'd just paint the patch panel and say i fixed it.üòâ"
2,-tcYHpGPCss,"haha so true about metal coat hangers, I can never find them when I need them.  Great tip on the filler rod."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,WOW! A DREAM COME TRUE. TWO OF MY FAVORITES WORKING TOGETHER.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"First things FIRST: With WHERE you guys live/work, the time of year, the fact you both usually work ALONE and this being an important necessity makes it SO GREAT to see a couple  ""PAISANS""  working TOGETHER!  PLUS, after watching all your videos (both of you), I know you both are NUTS enough to STAY on job till spring!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,This makes me happy. So good to see you guys working together on a project.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I've known Andrew about six years now and he's been to my house...he's done work for me and that is so Andrew.... him asking Dirt Boss If He Can Drive a dozer. That Dude is consistent!!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Roads looking great man! I can relate to those pedal steers when I helped him run the 977 I also felt the burn haha
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Man, what an awesome experience!  That mountain looks crazy awesome.  Congrats on the opportunity dude!  Hopefully there's more to come!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,So Glad to see the Dirt Boss and the OG Andrew do a job together. I was hoping this day would come!!  Nice!!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,A Dirt Boss and Andrew Camarata collaboration.  Christmas has come early fellas!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"You‚Äôre awesome and did a great job. I‚Äôve debated offering to help Andrew, but I‚Äôm always scrambling and don‚Äôt want to bother him. Dirt Boss rules excellent narration as usual üòä"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"AWESOME work you two:  That  ""BELL"" is a blessing for ANDREW on that mountain. Makes me glad his old truck got replaced!  That ""D4"" is a worker as well!  Stay safe & thank you BOTH!!!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Mike, glad you finally got together with Andrew. His mountain top property sits in between a network of goat path trails we have been riding ATV and Side by Sides on for years. I have witnessed the many changes he has made since shortly after he bought this property. Many future plans to come."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Nice to see you having some fun on this project.  It‚Äôs looking great!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Freaking awesome video man, that was cool to watch, alot of rock, that's gonna be one solid road when he gets it finished, you absolutely worked the heck out of that d4, it did the job though, hope there's more coming, thanks for sharing mike, an I look forward to seeing the next video üí™üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üí™ this is like one of the biggest collabs that has happened, pretty cool"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Without a doubt, this is a pair that I would watch any time.   Two of my favorite YT guys for sure.   Gotta go‚Ä¶haven‚Äôt watched it yet :)"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Like seeing you and Andrew working together
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Looks like that old dozer it the type to remind us we aren't in our 20's anymore. Bet when Andrew is in his 40's he has brand new seats on everything and nice new equipment. Life is good
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Finally! Someone we all know other than Jessie doing something with Andrew! Now we just need to get #dirtperfect up there. Great video
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,It was only a matter of time with you two practically in the same area. This was the perfect project for it too. Great vid!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"You guys will have great memories when you get old and broke down like me.
Nice vid. I enjoyed it a lot."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,It's been awhile since I've genuinely laughed.  When you got into the muscle burning I could relate.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Two of my favorite YouTube creators makin' it happen!  I am surprised to see Andrew with a machine that runs DEF.  Did you have to have Andrew show you some photo ID when you saw him?  Sweet truck for sure!!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"You two are Awesome.. 
Always love yours and Andrews videos.!!
LETS GO BRANDON...!!!!!!!!!!üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great Video Mike.  Looks like you helped Andrew a lot on his road.  I know he had to appreciate someone of your talent helping him on his project.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Ruff stuff right there and no breakdowns. That alone is impressive. Nice work
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Doesn't get any better The Boss and Andrew
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"The 1st day reminded me of when you had your boy go for a ride on the box blade.   (Karma üòÉ)

You guys really pulled through and layed some base. 

Aint easy sliding around on huge rock on a slope.  You sacrificed your body for production. 

You gotta give a little to get a little. 

Nice to see you guys work together. 

Drones and earth moving dont mix. R.i.pieces."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Never thought I would enjoy watching a driveway get built so much.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"That looked some hard going but you got it. RIP drone . Andrew seems like a stand up guy I believe this is the third youtube channel that has worked with him , not including Samantha's channel . Good to see people helping each other makes for good contentüëç"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Awesome video, took a breath when you almost fell, those rocks can be killers."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"You have got to put 12"" to 18"" of dirt around a tree before it will kill it and that's all the way around out to the drip line of the tree. I've run 953 cat track loaders for 14 years that are pedal steer. I enjoy them. I've never spent more than 5 minutes on one with the joystick steering. The company I work for has 3 and they're the piece of equipment I'm on 75% of the time. I guess I've gotten used to having to use my feet and legs so much that it doesn't bother me. You know you've put in a days work after bouncing around on a track loader for 10 hours though that's for sure."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Glad you guys got to team up, it‚Äôs epic  you tubing happening there."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Such a surprise to see you two working together. I have a hunch that Andrew is going to eventually build something big on his mountain. Maybe another castle. Dirt Boss is on site!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Awesome video of both of you working together!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"I have a 1988 850D case. Easier to steer with levers controlling each side of the transmission between your legs. It has foot pedals too, but they‚Äôre a pain. Wonder why cat never set it up that way. Plus the fans are reversible, so your feet are warm and at least your left handüòÇ"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great video Mike. I know that put a hurting on you. Can't wait to see your next video Brother. Have a great day and stay safe.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Made up seeing you two working together lovely old job
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Some men dream of climbing mountains‚Ä¶ Dirt Boss tames them!

Boss man, this is awesome.  Getting to   run that Classic D4 while working with AC had to be an adventure.  Was the reward worth cramped calves and a frozen keester? LOL

Don‚Äôt forget to chalk your broomstick cue.  I‚Äôll see you on the next one."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Andrew's drones have certainly died in fascinating ways.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Dude your gonna have to send Drew a bill for that dozer repairüòÇü•á
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I think there is enough rock there  to pave the whole mountain.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Winter is definitely coming for sure I'm working on getting my to deeres ready to hit the snow like the video bossüëçüëç
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great team work üëèüèº
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,When you speed up the playback at 31:05 it really makes it easy to see how you are sculpting the road level. I guess the objective is to give this muddy area some stability and to lower the grade going up that hill? I'm gonna check out your channel now....Greetings from Texas...John B.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Glad you and Andrew finally got together.üëåü§ì
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Best 39 mins of my life ‚ù§
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Love Your work ethics and wit ""Dirt ""Boss""üëç"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,This is the far North version of Letsdig and Dirt Perfect! ü§£  it's awesome to see you men working together.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Dirt Boss your in a whole different world when it comes to  equipment on this site!! Great video, and watch your step my friendüí™üëçüá∫üá∏"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,That's Hella cool Mike that you guys hung out. That's awesome  as hell. When I saw your title  I was like heck  yes.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"BELL B30E ""THE BEAST"" Quiet but deadly. D4 dozer small but destructive just ask the drone Oops cant. Great job. Future should be Awesome."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Nice work on a tough hillside.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Cool..!  a little ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù video with a fellow YouTuber.., great video.
Thank you sir."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"That straight, steep road is downright dangerous for a whole bunch of reasons. There are reasons why mountain roads zigs & zags."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I can‚Äôt believe he let you upload all this before he has even uploaded the blasting or anything for this. It feels like I‚Äôm cheating on Andrew if I watch.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"I think,Andrew's next 'toy' is going to be a rock crusher!
Great series!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Good stuff, thanks for the update!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Never viewed your channel before but it got recommended to me tonight. I'm now a sub!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Bad Ass! that was a kick ass video dirt boss! hope there will be more!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Looking good Mike . I hope u swung into Hutson to look at all that ston work we did in the park on your way in or home .
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Man I‚Äôd love to work with Andrew. Nice Ram btw!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"I drove a dozer like that for a short while!the worst time of my life?never been on one since?so when people say ""well your only going backwards and forwards ü§¨they're idiots?""it's cold and then some,stay safe out there?from BIGMICK IN THE UK üá¨üáß without snow ‚õÑÔ∏è"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,We need a stone shredder and a sorting system for fractions. Then it will be possible to fill such roads perfectly smoothly.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"D-Boss!  Good man going down to help him get out of the mud, go get yourself a million followers and then you buy the mountain top next door with that you tube monies and make rocky roads together‚Ä¶cool video!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Awesome video. Fun to watch!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Wow what a Christmas gift ...Dirt Boss and AC,  ""MINGKIA""  such enjoyment! Andrew has the D7and  the 963 up there,  seems to me they'd be better for the road than the D4, but they do DRINK FUEL $$ lol!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great video. That was a lot of rock.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,what a surprise! how many hours on that D4 dozer?
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Back on site and on this job today!!! 1:04
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Must say andrew is putting down awesome road base tell him to get crusher going
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"What a beautiful view, and no blinking lights from wind farms.  You are so lucky.  I hope the urban green terrorists don't take that from you."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Coffees on ,brother ,,looking good!!Cheers!;-)!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Nice work old school dozer I‚Äôve been there üëç
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Awesome Video Mike. Good to see you with Andrew.  Different world there upstate.  So close to this shithole CT.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Wouldn't the D7 be better  at laying and compacting a new road bed? I'm just asking,  I've never operated before...."
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,now this is my kinda video... building roads.. its what i do... rocks on the other hand... you can keep all that...
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,two of the best together...i lloooovvve itüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,New York + New York = good times!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,You are not the first person to ruin one of Andrew's drones. He does a fine job on concealing his anger but i9t is simmering. I can see dozing that rock is hard on the body and I bet the Cat doesn't like it either.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Did Andrew already blast the mountain? I haven't seen a video of it.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Are we seeing the making of an AC crew? Diesel Creek and Dumpster Dave right there with Ya.  Sam to.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,What happened to the rock crusher he had?  I thought he was going to process the rock for the driveway.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great collab üëå
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Love my ram. Great content. Subbed.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Great upload DB üëçüèª

2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I think he‚Äôs got a D7 up there hasn‚Äôt he? Might be a better machine to use üòÆ
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"Damn it would have been 3000' laid down if it was all 4"" minus lol about the only thing you can do with them big rocks is shove them in a hole or out of the way"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I'll stick to watching Andrew. Less talk more working
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Man I was hoping that key didn't snap off ü§£.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Deceleration pedal  use. would help I'm thinking lol.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"AC and DB what an awesome video,"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Awesome video
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,"About the drone, it broke for no reason!"
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Man I wish y‚Äôall wasn‚Äôt so far away Bossman I‚Äôm come help y‚Äôall knock that road out but south ga is a long way from those hills. Great video!
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,I really can not believe you are working for Andy. That road better be perfect. I know you are a perfectionist. . When I come there walking up that road. If I see any imperfections I know who to blame. You.  So it had best be perfect. I hate casting blame.
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Now if u can get your number 1 fan and his crew to come work with u. Get Todd to work with u
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Another cool channel to watch üòä
2,Th6b4Wo-BTU,Andrew needs a mobile gravel plant.  Get way more efficient use of gravel.

2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Guys I love your work but I think it's bullshit that you tease us by telling us what we're missing out on because we're not all patrons. Just remember were most of your money comes from and that's us watching all the vlogs right to the end even if there pretty crap like today.

2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Hire me. I live in litchfield and have my own car. I will keep that shop clean and organized and whatever else needs done. It bothers me how dirty it is in there.
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Did u turn the engine by hand first ???
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,"get an obd scanner, for future projects."
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Hell yeah
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Content every day is cool. No worries Bro.
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Subscribed for more stress! Lol
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,"Hey dude, do the whole basketball in the door deflated and pump that dent out"
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,100% not having the key is the problem. These engines have hella censors and I bet that's what it is
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,I don‚Äôt get why people paint the engines black. Like makes identifying leaks harder lol
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,First 30 seconds in‚Ä¶ please stop inviting Devin lol
2,s0CrgkC4l3w,Bro ruddy can we get some of the Patreon stuff on the channel for some of us who don't have it. so we can see how some stuff that's going on behind the scenes

2,s0CrgkC4l3w,My first thought was a wet i.p.d.m ..
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"A new twist to the channel?  Not just a teardown, but a teardown and rebuild maybe?  Should be a fun car when finished.  Also, glad to hear that you are feeling better and hopefully the rest of the family is well by now also."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The king has returned! Honestly missed your videos especially these repair videos, but you have to balance it with carnage."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"i enjoy watching your junk collection grow, keeps me from going out and doing the same thing. Glad to see ur back man!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad to hear your feeling better!

Saturdays (and sometimes Wednesdays :) ) aren't the same without you."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Many people today sneer/laugh at the C4 but in reality it was a groundbreaking design and was unbeatable in ""stock"" SCCA classes, so much so they were banned from competition and ended up with their own class in 1988.  They are arguably the best bang for the buck racer you can buy today.  It doesn't take much to make them very capable in today's events.  As a young man in 1984 I really wanted one but I was more into drag racing and sport bikes.   Eric, I hope you spend the time and money to bring this one back to perfection, it is a worthy project."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"As I leave to drive 7 hours to pick up a C5 I bought, sight unseen, to join my C4 (‚Äò94 aqua on black manual - seriously - LOL), your video made me smile.  Time, money, and space.  The constant battle.  From one madman to another - Thanks for the video my friend!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I like watching other people with similar car addictions, it always makes me feel better about my collection of old misfits. Hope to see more of this c4 in the near future"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I completely agree with you when you say you‚Äôd much rather have a collections of older, fun cars instead of something new and flashy. Could‚Äôve been me arguing that point:) Love the C4, it‚Äôs definitely on my radar too. Looking forward to seeing you address the issues. Greets from The Netherlands!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"In this series, Eric renews his hate for repairing all variety of corvette. I did a harmonic balancer on a C6 a few months ago, what a massive pain that was...oh and Noco makes a mean jump box...the GB150 is a beast"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Happy to see you're feeling better! Someone else already said it, but Saturday really isn't the same without you. Reminds me how much I used to love working on cars when I was younger and less broken."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good to see you, glad you are back and doing well.  I'm going to enjoy this series of Corvette mayhem !   LOL"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Great find!  Sorry about the gaskets, I‚Äôm sure nothing else was damaged when it overheated, right?  What are bearings for again?"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good to see you back, you sure that's just not a plug that was broken and then ejected the core out? How often does a head gasket blow and leak externally? Sounds just like a missing spark plug. 
And when you checked for spark, was that black decorative cover crap metal or plastic? Looked plastic and of course the test plug won't spark on the plastic. 
Good luck with this one, hope to see the rebuild in videos."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I had a 93, one of my 3 LT1 cars.  I miss that car and the opti wasn't great but was a bit over blown.  Currently, I have C5 Z06 in my little fleet, my second C5.  Looking forward to the videos.  I actually liked driving my 93 C4 6speed more than the C5 6 speeds but the C5s are much easier to work on, especially LT1 C4s."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Welcome to the C4 Corvette family!!! Once you understand GM mentality, it's a great car! Very good performance even compared to newer cars. So much fun for the money!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It would be a great to see you rebuild this, especially since you are in a unique position for parts and engineering contacts. All in all, if the frame is good and you can replace the broken plastics, then a blown head gasket and some heat damage is not a disaster and you'll end up with a low milage car in good condition you'll be able to enjoy, even if you end up just swapping out the engine."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Can't wait to see what you do with it, Eric!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I have asked NONE of those questions, I just love seeing what you have up next.  I love that you are so busy with projects, and that you care enough to take us with you.  Keep doing your thing and I'll keep watching!  Thanks for the videos!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"C4s are wonderful cars.  The 92-96 6spds have really good performance.  They are generally easy to work on, rock solid reliable and inexpensive to maintain.  If you're into modifying your cars... a great base to start from."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I'm very happy to see you working on an LT1
I can't get enough of it."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Awesome channel üíØ just found and subbed a month ago! I get to binge watching at times. Thanks from Cape Cod  where vehicles rust soon fast lol! Stay safe and healthy and thanks for doing thisüëç
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You are hilarious Eric, you always end up doing much more to get the car you purchase back to running condition, like with this yellow Carrera, but we all learn in the process, and this is where the fun lies üôÇ
You didn't have an engine teardown Saturday, I suppose you were busy wit this? üôÇ"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I'm both happy and sad that c4s are starting to make their rounds on YouTube across different channels. Happy because they're such cool under appreciated cars that are a great handling and performance bargain! I'm sad because of this attention, every Tim, Dick and Jerry will think that they have a special car and the prices are going to start climbing. Keep the c4 cheap!!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I wholeheartedly share your love of 80's and 90's cars! and I'm very excited to watch you bring this wonderful example of a corvette back to life!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Welcome back, you seem much better now so let's wait for that dipstick battle to commence üëç"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Best of luck with the project! I've got a manual '95 in arctic white as well, though it's not as kitted out (or as low mileage) as your project. Lots of fun, but lots of work. Worth it, though! Looking forward to more videos!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The minute it started, I heard the ""there's gonna be another video or 6"" noises. Hard to turn that engine over, too. Might be something from the crash wedged against a pulley or suchlike. (or a chunk of barrier cable wrapped around a pulley)  8^)"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Love that you‚Äôre saving these 80s/90s cars.  All these other cookie-cutter automotive YouTubers who‚Äôll only touch carb/points cars because they are too chickenshit to touch fuel injection are getting very boring.  Keep ‚Äúdoing you‚Äù!!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Love me some C4 action! Probably one of the most under rated cars of its time! Amazing car!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Darn, bad luck for you but this will be wonderful viewing for the novices like me. Great stuff as always!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice diagnosis!  Always loved the C4 - nice choice. üëç
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Missed seeing a teardown video this past Saturday (12/3) but I gather you were under the weather ; glad you are feeling better.  That Vette is gonna be a good challenging build and I look forward to seeing it.  Nice to have oil pressure as well.  HB56
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad to see you‚Äôre back, and with a new project car. I‚Äôm not a big fan of 70‚Äôs through 2000‚Äôs Corvettes, but it should be a nice ride when you get it done. With relatively low miles, it should be a decent investment. Looks like the Air bags and interior are still good, does that mean a clean title still?? Hopefully you and your family are doing well. Thanks for taking us along to enjoy your obsession or sickness, whatever it is."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You're not alone. I just sold off a couple of things that I had high hopes for but getting to old and not enough time or money.  You keep on trucking Bro. Oh, how's the new bundle of joy coming along?"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Currently chasing all the gremlins on my 96.    Was in pieces when I got it 3 years ago for $1900 with 81k on it.  Now looks much better and runs great but be ready for fun stuff like pinched wires on the trans tunnel which took out the tps and fried the ecm (rebuilt for $225 and ran wires up top for the tps).  Best of luck, can't wait to pick up some tips."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I want one just like it, blown gaskets and all. I look forward to the series, or at least to the next project that takes precedence."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I bought my 1995 in 1997 from a Chevy dealer.  It was winter, and the price was $21k.  It had 22k miles and was still under warranty.  It had every option except TPMS and ZR1, including the Z07 Autocross suspension.  It has been a very reliable, fun car.  However, the Optispark has been the bane of my existence.  Nearly every aftermarket opti has the tone ring spaced incorrectly, where it scrapes the optical sensor.  This will make it have a very short life.  So you need to disassemble any new opti, check and correct the tone ring spacing, and then reassemble it before you can use it.  The only part that dies is the optical sensor.  It takes a ridiculous amount of labor to get the opti out, mostly because of the Corvette's layout.  The 2-piece balancer helps, but everything is squished in there.  The plug wires are the most fun - be sure to label them before removing them from the old opti."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You have the skills and tools. Go for it. With a mystery car, it's almost always worse than you first think. Par for the course"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Love C4's, glad you will be bringing It back to life."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Well done on the buy!  I look forward to more videos on it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Ouch. But I have no doubt you'll get it roadable again. Looking forward to future episodes!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Another great teardown video. Keep it going
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Yup, I heard it when you were finally able to get it turning over and said there was a huge issue. There was a cylinder that didn‚Äôt have much compression. When it finally started and saw the smoke (steam) coming from the engine I said blown head gasket. Fortunately it wasn‚Äôt a fire that was causing the smoke. 

Aside from the obvious front end repairs needed it certainly does appear to be a Vette in very good condition and yes, a really nice white interior. So I can‚Äôt blame you for wanting the car. In the some 45 years being in the automotive industry I never had the opportunity to own a Vette. I‚Äôm sure once you have the repairs done you will enjoy that car immensely! Congratulations and good luck with your acquired C4.  üëè"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice to see your running on all cylinders
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Awesome car. I look forward to seeing it rebuilt and back on the road.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,EXCELLENT  4 weeks ago I just bought a '96 LT4 (Manual) in great condition and now I get to watch you work on your C4 as I work on my C4!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,what a beautiful car. I'm excited to see more content on it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I have had two c4s, an 85 and an 89 with the zf6, loved em both. Glad to see you back and healthy!!!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Fun Corvette project and you got it at a great price. Can't wait for the continuing videos.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I knew something sounded wrong when you were cranking it and in a way I was right about the compression -- I just didn't know it was a blown head gasket. I hope the heads aren't warped.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice car looking forward to seeing more of this one
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"There's nobody on YouTube more qualified to tear down an LT1.  Hopefully you can put it back together too.  As an 80s kid I love the C4 body style.  To me, that's what a Vette should look like.  Can't wait to see it drive!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"We missed you! However I'm glad to see you with a C4 Corvette. If you ever find a wrecked C4 Roadster, 86 to 89, I need a driver's door! The car rolled backwards into the garage with the driver's door open, folding the door forward. I have been looking for one for 3 years. I didn't think you looked for Corvettes, so I never requested one. I will put it on your list of cars to look for."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You know I just finished watching legit street cars, finish up an auction C4 with a blower on it. Glad to see people enjoying the LT1 engine."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,always difficult in these videos to know what these cars really sound like in person  but ithink this video got the sound through great.  hah
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Great lunch break video.  Keep 'em coming, Eric!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Glad to see you back!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I had a white 1995 base Corvette LT1 6-speed for 8 years, it was a very nice driving car, great performance value, very reliable and zero issues with the opti. I hope you get this built soon and back on the road!  Very fun cars."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The car is not really my style, but it doesn't matter. You make these journeys so enjoyable, and I always love to watch your videos."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Would love to see more videos of your vette when you get time very cool üëå‚úåÔ∏è
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Sounds like a nice time to pull the motor and rip into it for repairs
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Bummer about your findings, but it's likely easily repairable with such a low mileage engine assuming nothing warped or cracked. Merry Christmas!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I understand your sickness.

I was getting bored so I gave my son a 2003 Tacoma Prerunner in really great shape and bought a 2003 4wd V8 4Runner to tinker with.  It's going to end up costing way too much for what it's worth but I want to get back into 4 wheeling again and this is one of the cheaper ways to do it.  

Happy wrenching!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"while you're in there, drop the compression with thicker head gaskets and add a procharger"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I will enjoy watching this one. I have never been a Corvette fan but they are looking better to me as I age.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I‚Äôd send it back to the auction with miles listed and make some loot. But then I saw you have a parts car! Gonna be a nice one.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Please don't stop buying projects.  You're addiction for awesome car projects brings me happiness, therefore, it should bring you happiness too??  We love all your projects."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I get it.  I would love to have a rust-free (that's what killed ours) 85 or 86 Honda Prelude 5-speed manual like we had when I first got married. I really loved that car. Saw a navy one in the Barnes Parking lot on Forrest Park BLVD.  no rust... it looked primo and it gave me the warm fuzzies. I totally get it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad you found a ""good one"" and hope you get to enjoy it."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"A friend of mine has the same condition you do. He owns his own shop, but he's still limited on space. He has a lot of projects, he still needs to finish and never misses the opportunity to take on another project."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good stuff, looking forward to this build"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,That loud noise sounds exactly like what a spark plug left out of the cylinder sounds like lol thats some serious leakage lol
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Hey, I would have done the same thine. Especially for a 95 manual. Year I was born. C4 is the underrated gem of Corvettes"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"One tip... don't use the steering wheel as a handle when getting in/out, ruins a bushing in the column."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I love these late model c4s. Always wanted one.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,i'm LQQKING forward to the build and drive on your new car !
2,eRfNLGkohrw,You have to ground the plug to see a spark. Your plug is resting on a plastic bit.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"That is the best of the C4s. Those rims make it totally ok that the car is white. What a fun project, especially since you have a donner car. I‚Äôm jealous."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,always just a little bit more work than you think lol. Ready for the journey!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,It's also got a skip. Usually means low or no compression in one or more cylinders. Didja do a compression test on er?
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It's Christmas time and I've decided to sub, like, and such to channels I frequently watch.  I dig what you do and I hope the few pennies of ad revenue I'm providing helps you and the family out.  I still use an ad-blocker, but I digress... Merry Christmas!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Yea, tough break on it. Even with that nasty sounding crank, I‚Äôm surprised it ran! This one is gonna be a fun one to watch you build! Looking forward to it doing some nasty burnouts!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,What a chore! As soon as I saw the busted radiator and heard that start up I assumed head gasket failure. Sucks but at least you have a donor!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,The opty spark is a known problem for that particular engine
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I love how people abhor doing an optispark - the real fun is doing plug wires
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"well, if the injectors are pulsing (you can smell fuel) I'd start by trying a different ICM."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"As a former Mystic Cobra owner, I feel your pain with regards to paint."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Now this is a fix I want to watch ASAP Please !
2,eRfNLGkohrw,You can't test a spark plug while sitting on a non-conducting surface. The spark plug threaded portion must be grounded!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The sound when you crank, clearly something wrong with compression in one or couple of cylinders"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Tough luck on the engine!  But, those old V8s are easy to rebuild."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Hello amigo, thanks for all your contenido. I have learned a lot jut by watching your videos."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Nobody feels sorry for you
We all know how endearing a super car is when it is in need of work and the more complicated it is the more popular you are at work on Monday morning
Love the channel, big fan"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Well they no longer produce the clutch and flywheel. Dual mass flywheels are insane to find. Other than that and the opti spark they are cool cars.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Ah yes, our old friend Project creep. I know him well. I'm re-gearing my Jeep and also redoing the interior of my house, so I know all to well, ""in for a penny, in for a pound."""
2,eRfNLGkohrw,A Corvette build?  Welcome to the asylum!  Haha.  Just finished my ‚Äò73 L82 engine rebuild and can tell you finishing this one will be worth it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I'm a Ford Truck and Jeep XJ, ZJ, & WJ aficionado but, I'd proudly own that car. Great buy, IMO.
Glad you're feeling better."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I'm so happy u feel better buddy üôÇ
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Hey!  The corvette is a nice car in any year‚Ä¶.  Maybe change the colour. üòä. Would be good to see some of the work you do on it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I always wanted a C4 to take the body off and build an exoskeleton cage long before Cleetus‚Äôs Leroy became famous but wouldnt have a SBC, LT or LS put in it"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"I‚Äôve owned Mitsuyoshi Nishio‚Äôs old Super D 2018 car for the last almost 3 years. It runs, drives and shreds.. and I live in Phoenix, AZ. I think that would be a proper car for him üòÖ"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"JZX makes a lot of sense. Right hand drive, and 1JZ's have been fairly reliable when done right. New builds just seem to be a risk for drift week.

Probably not an option, but maybe ask Adam to rent his yellow one being its sorted and he'll most likely not be there?"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Why don't you just ask him what he'd like to drive? (Within reason)

Obviously want to see him in a s chassis, he's run several different motors in them over in D1 so I don't think it would have to be SR. Throw a ls in it and call it a day. He's also shown to be more than capable in a left hand drive too"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I would Love to see him in a Corvette! Would be fun to see him in something different. And I feel like he‚Äôs good enough to show off in a left hand drive car
2,jrVYtakJiSE,V8 S13 is defintiely the best option. You can't go wrong with that imo
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"My opinion, the right hand drive S-13 with the v-8 would be cool. Being from Japan, he may want to experience the USA set up. Let him experience that, it may add fun for him. üòä"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,RHD converted corvette. Seems like he figured out the v8 platform pretty quickly in his s13 he recently built
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I feel like you have to put him in a corvette for street driving sections
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"I still can't believe we get to drive with Nakamura, Insane!!! Can't wait for DW7!"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"The coolest option within reason would probably be an s chassis w a v8 or a jz, but with jz comes expensive, and i dont know how they tend to do on drift week. Seems like they work well but need a day of work every now and then but thats just my speculation. 

I agree, a vq car just wouldnt be that exciting. Even James Deane or Julian Jacobs have ti throw those cars around like crazy to make it exciting, and those guys are always fun to watch. 

But, seeing as Naoki just ran a turbo V8 in D1, maybe he‚Äôll be extra excited to drive a V8 car again for drift week. Obviously cant be the 1200 hp turbo beast that he built, but i bet he‚Äôd still be hyped. But who knows, shoot him an email or something haha. No matter what, its gonna be Naoki in the states so itll be hype nonetheless i think. Best of luck Aaron!"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Honestly a LS S chassis would would be good since he already has a v8 s13 in Japan
2,jrVYtakJiSE,New drinking game. Take a shot everytime he says ‚ÄúNakamura‚Äù üòÇ
2,jrVYtakJiSE,0:26 thats that Oregon in him üòÖ That was a joke by the way. I think the red s13 RHD car with the LS in it is your best bet for reliability and having him be able to shred comfortably.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Also he‚Äôs Naoki , he‚Äôs gonna be more than happy driving anything and he‚Äôll make it drift no matter what angle kit/motor etc"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I wanna go to one of these events for sure!
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Shoulda just kept it all a build secret and not even let him know what you were building ‚Ä¶. But I get it .. content
2,jrVYtakJiSE,2way and his b knuckle setup on that hatch.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"After you put out all your options and the time line, it seems the rhd S13 with a V8 is probably the best option. Please put an LSD in it though because  Naoki. And as huge of a SR20det guy I am, the V8 is definitely the best option, it really would suck to have an SR do the SR things while Naoki is trying to enjoy the states and driving."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Rhd v8 s13 with whatever kind of lsd he uses. Rhd 350z with a lsd would probably be hard to do in the states but if possible makes sense
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"RHD V8 s13 is good idea if you have no Crazy abundance of sr parts and Sr mechanics that side. BUT PLEASE LET HIM HAVE BKNUCKLE!...  As much as its a fun event he would want to do his best on a global stage again and be as comfortable as he can be . Man has proven to be able to adjust to anything but lets let him be himself as much as possible . That's what the perfect Naoki experience would be 

Video title and concept is cool to get attention online and all but lets let the man feel comfortable and do his best driving"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Just build him a RHD LS S13, which is basically his D1 car now. or a 1JZ"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"It will broke like yours broke in finals. Just for Brandon :D Bit of joke ofcourse cause I know, that you like each other, but damn...I have a bit 'enough' hearing all the time all about ""reliable drift car for life"". Those cars are used properly and probability that EVERY car will broke during few events of drifting is more then obvious."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Why not use ISR swap kit and put a VQ35 and put that into a s chassis. Seen as Naoki would be most comfortable in that chassis and you remove the reliability of the SR20 by using a VQ35
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"put him in a chaser, mark 2, or that jzx 90 you said you have

***EDIT ----- yeah, i guess you are doing the right thing. . A RHD s13, but with the v8 . . . should be bulletproof !

peace, Eturn"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Curious how he‚Äôs supposed to drive well if he‚Äôs forced to use an angle kit he isn‚Äôt comfortable with?
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I think any right hand drive Toyota would be great. I think he would really appreciate the jzx
2,jrVYtakJiSE,of all things i think its a shame that he already has much seat time in a s13 with a v8 it takes the wierdnes out of it. are you going to trow b knuckles and stance coilovers on that thing for familiarity? thanks for the effort!
2,jrVYtakJiSE,You can easily convert a LHD IS300 to RHD.. that would be a badass build
2,jrVYtakJiSE,You could eliminate the brake booster with the Chasebays 6:1 dual piston brake master to add some space
2,jrVYtakJiSE,The v8 s13 build makes a lot of sense plus I think hell have fun with the v8.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I would put him in something he wouldn‚Äôt normally drive ever like a mustang or something
2,jrVYtakJiSE,You know he has to be in some type of s chassis
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Wasn't Rudnicks SR20 actually just a DE non turbo with turbo added that he bought off Tommyfyeah?
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Throw in the KA24de, he's gonna be like this ain't no SR and boom done"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Just have part of the body on the nascar, will look plenty jank and fun"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Video needs more Mark. Feed that man!
2,jrVYtakJiSE,It would have to be a s14 with a JZ because you have lots of part.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,LS powered s-chassis is a no brainer
2,jrVYtakJiSE,E46 ? Lowered with a fire kit and his livery. 4dr 1j
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Damn I really wanted to see naoki in a turbo 4cyl
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Maybe an Ecoboost swap?
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Nevermind I like what you've already built!! RHD but built American style with an LS
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Whatever he drives, it's going to break"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"I'd rather have Nakamura drive a boring car that will last the trip with little to no issues, than a cool car that he only gets to drive a little bit."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Give him the full American experience, LHD Corvette"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Damn good Z that one ;)
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Nakamura fucking killed the 2 D1 seasons with his v8 car, I think v8 s chassis is the best option."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I can‚Äôt wait for this ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I would Go with a v8 s13 s14 s15
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Put him in a v8 s13 like his d1 car.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,He has to be in an s chassis
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Ebisu spec jzx100. Kinda stock but looks sweet
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Mustang or Vette. Let him learn left hand drive and Merica
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Pretty simple.... Barra S13 üòÅ
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Please put the body on the stock car before the LZ event. Driving that car almost pointless if you don‚Äôt
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Can you find a RHD E36 or E46? They're Silly reliable and pretty easy to set up, yeah?

EDIT: baited. You got me."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,The car you‚Äôre building is perfect
2,jrVYtakJiSE,What ever happened to the bubba drift Elco was a cool car to watch auto drift
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Rhd LS S-chassis. I think you've on the right track.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"give him the american experience, but im also thinking give him a modern chassis experience. to see the potential out there"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Are you putting on his custom knuckles or wise fad what‚Äôs the deal there?
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Just it him in your v8 s14 and be done haha that looks like a fun chassis to drive
2,jrVYtakJiSE,RTR Mustang just to be different
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"2j, they are bullet proof"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Aaron that‚Äôs easy ! 350 z man I don‚Äôt know about right hand drive ? Corvette let‚Äôs make him American
2,jrVYtakJiSE,naoki in a ka-t car would make me happy
2,jrVYtakJiSE,want to see him in a vq car
2,jrVYtakJiSE,RHD GT86 or GR86!
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Should put him in a coupe... Its only right.. Gotta be a coupe..
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Ask Adam LZ for a car.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,V8 s13 is perfect just make sure you put a lsd diff and a set of his knuckles s14 control arms and big spacers no wisefab .possibly even a pull up style handbrake like factory
2,jrVYtakJiSE,jzx or mark II with 500whp V8
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Put him in a 1jz s13 with 420hp call it a day
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"s13/14 with LS, run it"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Vette. When in Rome.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,C6 Vette with his style livery would be interesting.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,I got a rhd sr car for sale üëÄüëÄ
2,jrVYtakJiSE,E36!!
2,jrVYtakJiSE,2011 ford mustang
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Turbo Miata
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Something american, completely different from what he's used to. Nakamura corvette!"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"Your new jzx‚Ä¶.. rhd jz reliable and looks nice 
And yes i know they‚Äôre expensive but worth it haha"
2,jrVYtakJiSE,HR vq swap s13
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Vq swap in s14
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Your red s14 or something like that.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,jzx90 or 100
2,jrVYtakJiSE,2j s15 lol
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"I honestly think a 350z would be best. 
1. The reliability
2. The bulk of drifting is made up of grass roots guys. Getting to see what the best drivers can do in a car we can all relate too is very cool. It really shows what can be done with the same car most of us see or have. It's very eye opening. 
I always try to find videos of guys driving z's."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Jzx or zn6 gt86
2,jrVYtakJiSE,mustang
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Chaser
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Ls the world
2,jrVYtakJiSE,B-knuckle
2,jrVYtakJiSE,chaser
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"So funny people call gods car just another Z. best looking, good price best value for the dollar. RESPECT the Z. Watching SR guys spend tom of money to get turbo and all supporting mods after 7k they like omg we almost at 300HP lmao. Get a Z respect the Z and build it doper than any of them."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,It‚Äôs a crime to put him in a car that doesn‚Äôt have B Knuckle and a 2-way at the least.
2,jrVYtakJiSE,üëÜ - –ù–êV–ï –ê G–û–ûD –¢I–ú–ï - FIND Y–ûUR L–ûV–ï! ü•∞üëÑmüòú
2,jrVYtakJiSE,"I hope you're paying him if you expect him to drive ""as much as humanly possible""."
2,jrVYtakJiSE,Why not use ISR swap kit and put a VQ35 and put that into a s chassis. Seen as Naoki would be most comfortable in that chassis and you remove the reliability of the SR20 by using a VQ35.
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,I love seeing how you work you make it look so easy ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,Good job Brittany! keep up the good work . Like how your taking your time and doing it right some little mistakes but you caught them and corrected them without excuses makkes for good content
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,"Cool main caps, never seen them bolted from the side, when reinstalling do you torque the four main bolts first or start on the side, what are the benefits? I‚Äôm with you on the balancing, if your gonna try and balance the pistons might as well pull the connecting rods and go full pull. Glad your felling better!"
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,Good morning-awesome job! I like how you are very organized when disassembling-looks like a fun project and thank you for sharing ur knowledge and info. Stay blessed and looking forward to ur next video üòä

2,HHRjk2XrgGs,It's seems like the bottom end is built to be pretty heavy duty. I like how the manufacturer actually took the time to stamp labels into the pieces. They actually thought about the little things.

2,HHRjk2XrgGs,I‚Äôm not complaining. I had j to watch this twice to see everything that you did in the engine. Those pants are very distracting  ‚ò∫Ô∏è. You‚Äôre doing a great job. I always enjoy watching.
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,I'm glad I came across your Instagram account and it lead me here. Your move to Kentucky was my first video.

2,HHRjk2XrgGs,"you‚Äôre pretty awesome but that‚Äôs actually a six bolt main not a four boat main and when you fly cut pistons you‚Äôre removing metal if you want to turn high RPMs and have longevity, it needs to be re-balanced sure you can run it but it won‚Äôt last. i‚Äôve seen similar things done at the track to get a car back up and running. don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not hating so keep on having fun and making the videos. I wish more women would get in to mechanics."

2,HHRjk2XrgGs,"So yes, engines aren't perfectly balanced out of the factory. Are you planning on running this at factory specs then? No power adders at all? The further you push things the more sh!t has a tendency to break. You need to at least try to pair piston assemblies with similar weight."
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,Technically you didn't lie. Someone else changed your mind by not funding it.
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,your cute
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,Hello üòä
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,Yeah
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,About ?
2,HHRjk2XrgGs,First...
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Just had my recall completed. They found oil in one of the turbos and had to replace them both. Would have been ~10k bill otherwise. The car was driving sound with no issues. It was stock so no push back on the turbo replacements. Hope you get resolution on your recall soon.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Every tuning device that I ever had always had a warning label to ""Always return to stock before a service"" any service. One of the tuners even came with a Red OBD II cover that said ""Do Not Reflash"". 
There are often updates to the vehicle that are done during a service or oil change that people don't even know about. If you have a tune installed and they reflash the pcm, it will lock your tuner and your custom tune is gone. This usually would cost a few hundred bucks to unlock the tuner."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Whoever you talked to at the Audi dealer was misinformed. Audi recalls and warranties are not voided simply from having a tune or any mods on your car. To deny you service, they have to have proof the the tune or specific mod was the cause for warranty or recall work."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Mike, you should've either put snow tires on the stock 21 inch rims or the 20 inch rims that were on it when you got it. That would be a great option so you could drive the car more during the winter. I love the car though, looks great! Huge Audi fan here. Keep up the good work!"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Should really get a set of performance winter tires for those wheels for the winter. Those summer pirellis are going to do no justice on cold pavement or if it snows. Can enjoy that quattro in the snow too!
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Had the same exact issue with my 2017 S7 I had flex fuel kit SRM intakes and a DynoSpectrum DS1
A good Audi dealership would have fixed that without hooking the car to a computer. 
But if I am not mistaken they have to honor the recall under the Magnusin Moss warranty act which covers failures and recalls."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,This car is a beast. Love the older cars. So much more character about them
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Having received a tiny bit of training from one of the Big Three, I think they are handling the recall correctly.  Recalls affect the specific part and only other downstream parts if it can be proven the recalled part caused the downstream failure.  With a tune in place, proving cause becomes much more difficult."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Not sure why you would go lower profile for winter.  I would just keep the wheels that came with the car for winter with some winter tires on it, then your new wheels will be strictly summer."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Exactly why I haven‚Äôt done my new Audi S-Q8, what if it needs warrenty work? Just won‚Äôt be worth the headaches to gain 100-150-HP, hell isn‚Äôt 500-HP enough üòÇ"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"The oil screen recall is a ""safety"" recall, so it has to be done even if the car is tuned. Audi themself said that if the screen clogs and blows the turbos, you might lose control of the car so it was deemed as a safety hazard. Yes, they can deny new turbos if those are damaged, but not the screen itself!"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"My S5 was tuned with a pulley back in 2015 and it was similarly flagged when it had a centre diff seal leak. The dealership had to submit a form to Audi to consider waiving the warranty rejection flag and eventually Audi accepted that the tune was not the cause and they worked on the car under warranty. They should be able to submit that form for you if the turbos have damage‚Ä¶not that they‚Äôd waive that lol

Flashing back to stock doesn‚Äôt work either - they ECU has memory, plus the VIN is in the system haha"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Who else saw this coming?? Something always breaks after he gets a tune
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"I've just booked my RS6 in for the recall. Tuning is irrelevant. Whether it's tuned or not, the recall work is due regardless.

The warranty isn't completely void either - only the components that are affected. For example, if you put an exhaust on it and a window regulator went bang, you're still covered.

Whereas if the gearbox blows, and it's pushing 700hp/1000nm - those components aren't covered."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"The new wheels look Great but the tire being a 30 is definitely going to be a rough ride. Not to mention with winter around the corner, pot holes will be abundant, so I hope that you're not in the same predicament as the previous owner.. √¥¬ø√¥"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Now you can‚Äôt say you‚Äôve never had an issue with a tuned carüòÇ
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"I‚Äôm sure they deny any warranty on the turbos because the tune increases the performance beyond the intended parameters. In doing so you can potentially damage the turbos, drive shafts, U-joints and differentials. It‚Äôs a four door grocery grabber albeit quick. It‚Äôs engine output can exceed the norm, thereby pushing other components beyond their capabilities and cause damage. You may not have a warranty any longer, but a recall item‚Äôs damage could be worsened by the tune because they don‚Äôt recommend it. Mmm"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Even if you reflash as ‚Äústock‚Äù it will still come up as tuned in their diagnostic tool.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,I genuinely hated the silver along my a4 trim. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing lol
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Tune or no tune safety recall still has to be performed.. trust me I‚Äôm tuned and the dealer performed the recall. They trying to get over on you.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Hey, Mike, nice rims, but too low profile tires. The older tires had more ""meat"" on them. Just think about it, if during this winter you will by accident hit a pothole, those nice rims will for sure get bent. I will always get a thicker profile tire, especially in the winter, when potholes are filled with water and you cannot tell how deep they are and same time cannot avoid them, but run into them. Just a recommendation. I remember at some point that you complained about bad roads in Pittsburgh. You even had a case with one of your AMGs, when you hit a pothole."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"100% agree with the blacking out of the exterior. Subtle and meaner, suits the bark of your exhaust."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Mike is putting stock wheels on his car.. are we officially now living in the matrix
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"It's not ""just a tune"", every new electronic device, appliance, that you buy and mess with will void the warranty. I am sure you know that. Why do you expect Audi to be responsible for your turbos if your ""tune"" destroyed them? They can't prove it's not your tune, you can't prove it's not your tune....that's how things work. Again - not sure why are you so shocked about it."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,A recall is a recall. Doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs been modified. It can happen to a 20 year car and the recall work must be done
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Regardless of make or model if you remove the stock tune for an aftermarket tune and most cases you forfeit warranty 'but'  there are excellent dealerships with awesome service departments that will work with you.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"This is surprising, if it was warranty related that‚Äôs one thing but a recall is a recall and I think they should handle it free of charge regardless of tune"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,makes me fell much better when Mike does his own DIY - glad I'm not alone...
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"I had mine done, it‚Äôs a recall. They‚Äôre supposed to fix it no matter what. My S6 is tuned with turbos and downpipes. Hopefully this helped! Not sure why they would not cover it. Very misleading of that dealership"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Just have the screen deleted or get the JHM screen location kit. Kit allows you to service it quickly versus an all day job. Honestly you do not need that screen though, it come either right before the oil filter or after, then oil goes to the turbos. No point whatsoever. Even with the updated screen the exact same issues can happen."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,So with audi when its tuned and they detect it their system flags it its called td1 once the car is TD1'd its associated with the vin so its gonna be like that for life.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Sounds like BS. The recall is still applicable regardless of warranty status, however the fact your warranty is over and now denying a recall for a car you can no longer claim warranty for anyway is crap. Audi should fix the issue they have acknowledged as poor design.  Fight"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,This car really needs a brighter color to wake it up. Gray even makes black seem exciting
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,The problem isn't with a tune.  The problem is with Audi.  I've owned 2 and wouldn't take one for free.  Audi takes less responsibility  than any other company that I've ever dealt with.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"They'll just put a different oil screen in there.

Pay someone to REMOVE the oil screens and be worry free of failing turbos."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"The Issue with the screens is that they get clogged up over time and starve the turbos of oil. That's why people remove them, It was a good idea in theory if they would of put them in an area that could be easily serviced and checked ."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,byt oljan lite oftare   och v√§lj en med lite h√∂gre v√§rme grad  typ 5w50 som fungerar p√• audi
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Not trying to be negative but I‚Äôve got a feeling when they do the work regardless of the condition of the turbos they‚Äôre going to say they are ‚Äúbad‚Äù. They know you spend money on cars and probably figure they can screw you out of some turbos.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Personally id rather not had a screen obscuring the oil feed to my turbo, its only a matter of time before that gets blocked up with carbon and starves the turbo of oil ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,AutoVlog Great Video I think your Audi RS7s stock wheels look awesome and I think you did a great job installing the Black Badges and I think they look great and I don't think your Audi RS7s Warranty should be voided because of the Tune
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Did you ever wonder: Where this guy found all his Problems...??  üòÑ  üëç
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Imagine the dealer says the turbos are done hahaha
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Good to see a sponsor on the Chanel you deserve it sir ü§ô
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Looks good brother üëå. Can not wait to see what your going to do
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Man! The car looks a lot of better now!! My Civic Si 2015 have a wheels like that from factory and I loved
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Selling your FERRARI was a bigger mistake!
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,I was dying watching you take that badge off üòÇ
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"If you call Audi HQ and explain that you are a YouTuber with quite a large following and tell them your situation, I don't see how they would deny you full coverage. What you said in the video is all true. Denying a recall just for a two week old tune is lame.

You give them free exposure by taking viewers on the journey of modifying the RS7, I'm sure they'd see the benefit you provide in inspiring others to purchase an Audi of their own.
You have everything documented from buying the car, to mentioning the recall, to getting the tune, all with specific dates. 

I had a similar issue with Audi of Pittsburgh refusing to perform an Audi Cares service while it was still under the specified mileage. I called HQ and they said I should be OK. Called Sewickley instead and they did the service."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Always revert to stock tune before going to dealer
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"like the black wheels better, just sayin, excellent video as always despite all the hiccups."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Just do early oil changes with quality oil and filter should keep that screen clean
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,@autovlog definitely better with the stock wheels over those other ones‚Ä¶I ordered the same black emblems and man that front 4 rings was a PITA üòÇ
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Drink Every time Mike says ‚ÄúTuned‚Äù
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,I have a 2016 RS7 with an APR stage 1 tune. Had the screen warranty work done at my dealer without a problem. Never questioned.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Uppskattar dina videos üëç.. h√§lsningar fr√•n en √∂rebroare üí´
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,The recalled is covered because it was put out before modifications go to a different dealership idk about your state but some regular shops will handle recalls
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"This could be a major issue, they suffer from engine catastrophic failure. Well known TSB"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Everyone knows before you take a tuned car to a dealer you return it to stock config.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Watch out for tuning the badges‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"@AutoVlog

Couple things.
I literally thought about the badging on your exhaust video, ""He needs Black Badging badly.""üôåüèæ

Also, how much for those rims and tires you took off the RS7?"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"*8:53:21** Can we only take a moment to congratulate how much time and dedication he put into these videos?*
*It is fabulous, and I consider they justify  more than that* üòÜ"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"U can replace the oil screens yourself it‚Äôs not a hard job, honestly u can remove them like I‚Äôve done I have a stage 4 ts1 turbo s6"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,I would check with another Audi dealer. This is a service campaign and not a warranty coverage. Now if your turbos blow you won't be covered because of the tune but this still should be serviced.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,You could have just spray painted the logo black instead of removing it!
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Audi WILL do the recall for the oil strainer thing. Not the turbo's, but they will replace the oil strainer when the car is tuned. Go back, or choose another dailer. The oil strainer is a mandatory fault from them."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Any alteration or ‚Äútune‚Äù to the stock fuel tables will impact emissions. Given VW‚Äôs history with the EPA, they won‚Äôt touch it. Good luck."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,OMG!  You were killing me rambling about that tune...lol
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Love the RS7 content
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Welcome to Audi TD1. Even if you revert it back to stock they can still tell that the ECU had been re-mapped. ECU has a counter that ticks everytime you tampered the OEM tune.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Everyone and I mean everyone knows that a tune will void your warranty  or recall issues
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"For the first time, we agree on wheels."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Great wheels for the snowy winters
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,That mini vac looks awesome!!!
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"We all love Mike, but he needs to do some research. Something as simple as watching other YT channels about this car, he would have known about this. Most 4.0 owners are doing the OS delete and oil line kit. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Go to another stealership or call AoA,  it's a recall they have to do it. All the tuned S/RS guys have had their cars done under warranty. The stealership just reflashes your ECU and you lose the tune. I just had my S7 recall done and got a sweet Q8 loaner. Also the stock turbos and PCV are warrantied up to 120k, tuned or not they have to honor the warranty. Find a ""better"" stealership."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Welcome to TD1 Status.  Ugh.    I tuned my car right at the selling dealer and told me at that point to NEVER bring it back to any Audi Dealer as they will scan the car for oil changes even, etc.    This isn't new mind you, etc."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,I have those 30 profile wheels on my S5. I have cracked them many times.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"i am sure this question was asked, we obviously knew about the screen issue before you tuned it. so why wouldnt you get the recall taken care of before the tune? priorities...."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,The car‚Ä¶ so much cooler than the R8. For real.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Mike doesn't like  bright accent but...... polished wheels are ok  :)
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"My local Audi dealer use to do APR tunes themselves... they stopped Oct 2020...when epa crap became a issue... I always remove turbo screens myself when I upgrade turbos...so there you have it... replace the pcv yourself,remove screen and thrown some 9 fluted hybrid turbos in it and intake or downpipes, upload ds1 stage 3  and your done."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Take a shot every time he says ‚Äútune‚Äù
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"All though Audi will deny warranty and or extended warranty due to tune. They cannot deny this one as it is a safty recall. I would go back or call Audi.  Again, this is a national saftey recall not an exteded warranty,"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Woulda just blacked out the gill surround not the badge. You want ""contrast"" then the audi logo should still pop chrome imo"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Hey Mike at the end of the day you can always ask Rich rebuilds. And perhaps do a collaboration. He did the same recall for his now gone Rs7. Also Mike you ever think of doing a 4D emblem, I did it to all my A3's and S3's. Hence my profile pic. Stay safe cheers!. üëäüèæüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"It's a safety recall, they are required by law to do it. I'm stage 4 and got mine done. They will not warranty your turbos tho.

Also your explanation about the screen is very inaccurate. The screen gets clogged over time and prevent the oil from flowing thus the turbo seize because oil starvation."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Nice car man! i bought a RS7 c7 4 months ago. it has catless downpipes but its not tuned its still stock. is it alot quicker with a stage 2 tune? (greetings from the Netherlands)
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,What was the name of the shop in Miami that did your tune? And what did they charge?
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Magnuson moss act protects you from them voiding your warranty or not performing a recall unless they can prove that the modifications you performed caused the problem, now, a dealer can refuse to do the work but call up Audi NA and raise hell"
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,‚Äúit was too boring to film‚Äù proceeds to just fill the video with footage from the tire shop and rambling on
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,A good dealership that value's you as repeat costumer will over look that issue. I've even had dealership run a different Vin to get it covered under warranty.  Take it to another dealership and tell Bobby Ray haul to kiss it.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Its a recall campaign so basically Audi's fault for screwing things up you having a tune shouldn't have any effect whatsoever on top of that car is out warranty tell em to kiss your ass and change a dealer as they have no clue
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Yes them rims are much better!!! Looking good!
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,The recall should be honored.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Has anyone recommended Mike to put an illuminated Audi emblem ?
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"Take it to Audi Washington (PA), they were an APR dealer and actually flash one of my cars with the APR tune a while back.  Very friendly with tunes.   Give it a shot."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,"the Dealer is wrong, this is a recall not an extended warranty issue, this is a safety concern so they have to do the recall, Also if your looking for a set of wheels for the RS7 I have a set of ADV.1 3pc wheels AD005 for sale."
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,Not surprised.  My local Porsche dealer said the same thing.  Had to remove the piggyback tune before getting a recall done.  Super lame.
2,GKK4QiyCxJg,always problems with audi service remember the r8 battery ? :D
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Chris keeps me highly amused with his understatements and pragmatism ... ""Yeah, it's crept up that one, hasn't it"". Another entertaining episode, thanks."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Usual perfection with a totally focussed attention to detail. Really tasty parts bill. A really lovely, low miles Polo. Form a queue guys. Glad to see a decent margin coming out of it for youüëçüòé"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hi Rob &  Chris,  I've been using those connectors for a couple of years,  you're right they're brilliant,  never given me any problems."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hi Rob, great episode as normal. As an aside when in-line splicing multiple cables it‚Äôs best practice to stagger the joints if you can it saves ending up with a big lump in the cable and protects against possible issues further down the line."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,The tracking showed how perfectly the car was rebuilt! Top jobs lads
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Damn those parts where expensive full face lifts on rare models have really pushed prices sky high happy for you both that you will be able to make a profit out of it & looks fantastic üëçüëçüëç
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"The parts total escalated quickly üòÆ
Still a cheap enough thing at ¬£9k though, another quality repair üëå"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"The Polo looks like brand new Rob!

Quality rebuild as always Rob,we never doubt your work! :D"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,I would of thought 10k would've been a better price for that car with all the work you both put into it? Ended up lovely though boys. üòéüëç
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hard to look at the original damaged car to what you guys finished with. Shows how good Chris is at repairing with the tracking so close. Top job guy's, hopefully it will be sold soon and on to a new home."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"The little rings on the ends of your solder sleeves are environmental seals, to keep moisture out of the solder joint. They're great devices, just go easy with how you apply the heat on pvc-jacketed cable as the cable insulation can melt before the solder. I also would tin the wires before fitting the solder sleeve to avoid a dry joint. Very handy little things; I use loads at work (not cars)."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Nice and easy end to this one. Love the heat shrink for the wiring, will certainly look for them when I need to do wiring again. At least you managed to keep your hands warm doing that üòÇ what a cracking little runabout üëçüèª"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Good evening Rob and Chris, what a transformation. 
That was one hell of a parts list.
Thank you for taking the time to upload another video. Ged."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"I use those connectors quite a bit, if your joining a bunch of close wires 
I use a wide blade metal scraper and place it under the wire I‚Äôm working on to avoid melting others around it!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Well done guys. Always nice to see a car returned to MINT condition, especially a POLO. üòÅüòÅ
Lovely job. Expensive but well worth it. Cheers, Bob"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Yikes that was a shock repair bill, just shows even a cheap looking car that's a limited run will so eat the cash out your wallet, still a worthwhile repair and look at the results 5‚òÜ again lads üëè"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"When you make electrical joints, stagger them along the loom so you don't get a big lump when you tape over them. Use self-amalgamating tape as it will survive the weather better."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Great to see the before picys again as it's easy to forget how bad some of the cars are. Great job gents.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"A really good repair to the Polo, you have made it as good as new. Even the professionals could not detect that it was repaired. Regarding the heat shrink and solder joints, I use them for harness repairs which are exposed to the weather. They are really good if used properly."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"That will make someone a nice little car,well done lovely job as always."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Rob and Chris, great work! Especially those solder heat shrink! Always a pleasure watching!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Another great turn around guys, cracking little Polo all sorted for someone to grab a quality car at a bargain price üôå"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"You're like a well-oiled machine, Rob. Nice work on this one."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hi chris, we use those solder splices in the aerospace industry. I use them daily. Good enough for a typhoon great for a polo. Dazza"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,How you guys have evolved with the cars you fixed back in the early days of the Channel and your present projects is brilliant viewing. üëè ü´°
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"The solder joint repair things are brilliant I‚Äôve used them so many times, another good video and another good car, well done üç∫üç∫"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Well done Rob, you got stuck in on this one."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hi Rob, I mainly repair these new shape Polos, do you have a trade account with TPS? I find most the genuine parts are pretty reasonable, and cheaper than main dealer, especially things like the fog lights, front wings etc. They also stock the 3pin connectors you needed for pennies. 
Sometimes not worth the time searching for used parts. 
Anyway, great video as always üëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,I am always astounded by you in-depth knowledge of salvage . Best channel on YouTube by far.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Evening Guys. What a lovely Polo. I was trying to add up as you were talking doing the number and was as shocked üòÆ as you both were. But a fantastic end result and a lovely little car for someone‚Äôs Christmas üéÑpresent üòÑ
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Prices now are just crazy . Still yet another great little car out the done lads . Well done thank you for another great video .
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Another cracking job lads! That car's gonna make someone very happy.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,I wondered if those easy solder joints were any good. Now I know. Thanks guys. Superb job as usual.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,VW's are good but always have been overpriced. Amazing that you could spend twice on parts than the car actually cost
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Looks top quality as always Rob and Chris. Well worth the expense and will definitely will be a good profit.Keep up the hard work and cheers for the video take care
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Those red rings in the heatshrink solder is adhesive. It makes the connection watertight. Good stuff with the polo
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Those heat shrink things look really cool, thanks for sharing that :)"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Great tracking machine, though I would just have to get the both sides perfectly equal, this is why I‚Äôm not a millionaire."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"not even the pros can tell you have repaired it, just goes to show the quality of the work you guys do !! another one saved .
thanks for the content guys"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,you've both done it again what a lovely polo absolutely immaculate keep it up guys
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Rob one thing to try with the heat shrink solder joints is to stagger them on the loom so you don‚Äôt end up with a large bump in the loom under the tape
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Aren‚Äôt those heat shrink solder splices brilliant! I‚Äôve used them in the aviation industry for years. Great invention. TBH the prices for those parts seem reasonable by comparison to what we‚Äôd pay here in Canada, if you could even get them.  Great video as usual."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,I‚Äôm not a fan of VW‚Äôs but this is a nice little car. Top work! It‚Äôs cars like this that catch out the man doing it himself on his drive. A bargain can soon go down the pan if you need to load the parts canon.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,No bodge with these guys just a proper job well done lads.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Lovely car , really nice job on that and a good profit , a lot of parts went into that surprising üôÑüëåüëåüëåüëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Excellent content,  a very well sorted polo there, total credit to the team!! üëç‚úäüëèüöô"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hi Rob and Chris, really nice car, really good profit, exceptional value for whoever buys it. And it will be snapped up. Great content as usual. Alex."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"It is amazing how all the small amounts add up to one big one 
That is a lot of money but at least a profit still in it üëçüëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Rob - there‚Äôs an attachment that fits on the end of the heat gun that spreads the heat all the way round those connectors, makes life easier when using them, it should have come with the gun. Great job as always"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"We feel your pain, the post is ridiculous at the moment. Its killing small businesses."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Another great job guys - and the mics are working well at last üòä
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,That‚Äôs a really lovely car been a long time got there in the end I love the way you are so meticulous and that‚Äôs well worth the money üëçüëå
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,That rear spring looks like it came out of a ball point pen ü§£
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Cars like new guys, professional repair and rebuild as always,no corners cut in this garage,well done guys"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hello Rob and Chris, I used these 'solder shrinks' every day in my old job repairing looms on cherry pickers. I have even successfully repaired canbus looms with them, never ever had one fail. Much more reliable than soldering and a bit of electrical tape!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"I've been working on bikes and cars for many years now. What you guys do is incredible, much respect from me here in Lincolnshire."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Cracking video as always, going to be a lovely little car for someone."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Great little Polo, well done - amazing how the price creeps up though !"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Got the exact same connector ripped off on mine, will try them solder joints!! Also that radiator support grill cost me ¬£20.45 before VAT from TPS, shopped around for most other parts, even got the bonnet in colour ¬£130! üòÇ"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Another cracking video guys.  The Polo came out well, says enough when your tyre guy made those positive comments.  Looking forward to the next one!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Great build this one, bit unlucky with the harder to find parts but glad you have some profit, really nice clean car for someone"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"It‚Äôs been a great series on the Polo. You know that crunching the numbers is going to be a long list when it starts 3/4 of the way through the video ü§£ Still a good pre tax profit, but just shows how even a run of the mill car can soak up the money in parts."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Well again you smashed it out the park what a lovely car who ever buys it better look after it. The work you put in deserves a reward well done lads üëçüëå
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Another informative post guys, when you went through the numbers rob it made me realise why I shy away from special edition cars they always seem to be more expensive and a nightmare for parts as you just pointed out, really enjoyed the post and already looking forward for Fridays post"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Just brilliant work yet again from the dynamic duo. Well done guys. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"We had those solder joints at Citro√´n back in the 90's, there should be an heat gun nozzle adapter available for those connectors too mate üòä"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Another cracking little motor you fellas have turned around again someone will be well chuffed when they buy it üòÄ. Parts pricey but you get what üò≥ you pay for, great video üìπ üëç as usual fellas. Take care and stay lucky and healthy looking forward to Friday's video üìπ üòä as usual."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Haha the little cheeky grin when walking to front of car that‚Äôs the best feeling when you get things fixed üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Cracking job as usual lads.  Question, I know you mentioned recently that you do other things (i think it was flipping cars) be good to see a video on that side as that must go a big way towards paying the bills (¬£1300 each for 3 months with this car would struggle to buy a round in some places down sarf üòÅ)"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Great result guys, a staggering overall figure to fix
It up but well worth it. Brilliant hack Rob on that three pin socket you needed for that front DRL.
On to the next one."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Top work on the VW POLO guys.  The car looks like a totally different car you would never know if it was ever involved in an accident.  The car looks like a beautiful car lads well done guys you‚Äôve earned small profit out that car.  Can‚Äôt spot a fault with that car so far.  Rob Your going to do some snagging in that car don‚Äôt go to crazy Rob üòÇ  see you on Friday.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Look at how lovely this turned out definitely a win üëÄ
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"VW do make some nice cars, but they have become awfully overrated among other brands."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Wow, Pricey!! Glad you two managed to make some money out of it, hard work and perseverence paid off.üëçüëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Those heat shrink solder sleeves are mustard! I find the wind proof lighters work as well as a heat gun. Great to see it all back together.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Love my Dub and all things VW except the new gen Polo's....expensive girly toys and high maintenance just like their ownersü§£
As always a great vlog guys üëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Really pleased you have got that one finished it Looks like new 
Well done Rob with the solder connection's you can buy them to fit all sizes and if you don't have heat a disposable lighter work's just as good üëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Well done guys. A nice little car for someone
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Clever fix great job Rob and Chris, great work"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Heatshrink solder sleeve connectors widely available on ebay. Also recommend Lidl Parkside heat guns when they have them on sale - wide range of temperature control with LCD display and lots of accessory tips so safer to use in tight spaces.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Very nice results gents, and a good series, albeit an expensive one. You will still come out with a good profit, and someone will get a very nice car. 
Always enjoy your projects and I thank you for keeping us entertained and engaged."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,I used those heat shrink solder connections 43 years ago in the RAF. So long as both ends are tinned they work a treat.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Another tidy rebuild.As usual you and Chris have done an excellent  job on the polo.you would never no it was involved in an accident. üëçüèª
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Another  entertaining video!!  The polo lives to fight another day, thanks to you guys !!
A fantastic cheap new polo !!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Another sorted guys well done . Scary how the bottom line turns out on some projects.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Great wk as always Rob & Chris.
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"I've used those electrical connectors when refurbing my son's Westfield. Brilliant idea. Quick, easy and simple."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Hello Rob and Chris,what a awesome turnaround on this VW Polo,to how it was before,the postal strike makes everything late."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Lovely little car now, cant believe the price the bits came to, but still a bit ov profit, another mint job lads üëçüëç"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,Who would have thought that little polo would swallow that much to get it completed. Well done on completion.   Crack on
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Those connectors are great - Renault used to sell them in the crank sensor repair kits.

And those VW Center caps - I too bought some off eBay and last week tried to fit them - very tight!!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Thanks for that vlog. As usual it was educational and interesting. Will it sell with those costs for parts, at that price there will probably be a queue!"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Great video lads that was a splash of cash too get the vw done,profit well deserved ü•ä"
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"Never been a fan of the Polo, tbh.  But another cracking job completed.  Proof of the pudding will be the sale price of course."
2,LHYRwEMWZY4,"A lot of money spent, but we'll worth it.  Another cracking car lads üëçüëå"

2,tw799DnQ7-M,Gtr and F80 would be what I would do but either would be sick. Not much gtr content you can make without making it undeliverable without a fat tire
2,tw799DnQ7-M,"Get a g80 it would be so sick especially when you start to mod it you‚Äôve had the gtr for a long time you‚Äôve had your fun with it, it‚Äôs time to move on to bigger things"

2,tw799DnQ7-M,"Gtr is a legend car but maybe sell it for the g80, new content and lots of tuning capabilities as this vid shows haha"
2,tw799DnQ7-M,"GTR and F80 would make  for more content,  but  then again those carbon buckets in the g80 are too sexy"

2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Absolutely stunning cars. There's always such a sense of occasion whenever I see one of these. Love the front and also the 'hips' at the back, and the interior is gorgeous. Wrong engine for me though. The V8 sounds as good as the car looks! Would definitely have one of these if I had the money and needed something this big. Fabulous."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,This is easily the best review you‚Äôve done. Keeping it real and intelligently philosophical. You‚Äôve perfected your craft. I really enjoyed this. Thank you!
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I feel exactly that way about my newly acquired XJ portfolio, every time I see it I think ""Yes, it's mine"" it makes me feel amazing. Best ¬£19,000 I've ever spent. And you're absolutely right, I could have gone and hid in a corner plagued by ""what ifs"" but faint heart never won fair maiden or put a piece of automotive art on your driveway. I have no regrets."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I've always loved the styling of the Quattroporte. Not sure I'd go for the diesel version as the petrol V8 sounds gorgeous. Great video, Matt."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I picked up a 4 year old petrol Maserati Ghibli couple of weeks ago, I got an amazing deal on it and I gotta say it's just an incredible car. Yes I do have some criticisms, but at the end of the day the sound, beauty an just how special it is, does it for me. Puts a smile on my face and the attention you get is like nothing else! It's the sort of car you buy with your heart not your head, and of course a BMW is better, but I don't care, these are just something else! Great video!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I looked at one of these last year. Went for a 640d Gran Coupe in the end. What swayed me was the improved performance and interior quality of the BMW. That being said, every time I see the Maserati I can‚Äôt help but admire those lines. Great review! üëèüèª"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"One of my neighbours had the petrol version of this. He had it from new for a time, and then swapped it for a Merc soft-roader of some sort. I spoke to him about it, and he loved the Maserati, but said as soon as the warranty was up, he dropped it like a hot rock.
I like this video because it gives a a good opportunity to put Matt right about something. I understand his spiel about enjoying life's pleasures. Life IS fleeting, and we must live it to the full while we can. When we are young, we take it for granted, then as we get older, we realise how precious it is, and look back on the things we could once do that now we can't. Where once illnesses were an inconvenience, in later life they become frightening. Nobody mocks an old man for having ""man-flu"" because that ""man-flu"" might kill him. Increasingly, the reports of people who die are about people a similar age or younger that you. One by one, you say a final farewell to life-long friends, and taste bittersweet irony as you consider whether you're luckier standing at the graveside than the guy in the coffin. To surmise, life is too short and precious to waste trying to keep a bloody Maserati running properly with everything working. Buy a 5-series in an unusual colour if you want something different."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Love these...Need you to do the Ghilbi too dude... been genuinely thinking about one of these for a while now they are coming down in price... and diesel MPG sadly has to be a factor. üò¨
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Arguably‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..my favourite car. But with a V8, and possibly an earlier one with a manual box. Glorious interiors, again, not so much that one since the Chrysler influence, but that V8 is one of the best sounding engines ever. Great video again üòÄ"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Great review on a lovely car Matt. Your comments also on life and your general wellbeing was also very well put; very profound. Continued good health to you and your family and we will all see you on the next one. Cheers for now buddy.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I felt the same about my XF which I got just over a year ago - no regrets and it's NEVER let me down (despite Jaguar's reputation for ""unreliability""). Even drove to Venice and back from Manchester for our family holiday last August. And got admiring looks wherever we stopped on the continent."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I've slowly watched more and more of your reviews since COVID and they are really growing on me. I feel like I'm in familiar territory when hearing your voice reviewing a car.

I've been a Lexus person for a long time, owned about 9, love them. Wife currently has a CT. I buy and sell at least once or twice a year and break even or make a profit, and have felt comfortable with Lexus cars because of their reliability. But I've always loved the look with Mercedes and their cars. I recently bought a W205 C-Class and absolutely love it. There are times admittedly where I wonder if I regret it buying it, I had to replace my 2 rear airmatic struts. But watching this video gave me a sense of encouragement. I don't expect the C-Class to be 100% reliable, but I've always wanted one and I'm glad I've bought this one. Thanks again for your amazing reviews."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I really thought about getting one of these when I got my 2014 S Class LWB, really loved it being really exclusive and beautiful looking, but chickened out in case was not as reliable and quality! I love my S Class but the ‚ÄúMaz‚Äù wow! Fabulous review as always Matt!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Enjoyed that and as usual I‚Äôm homesick from the landscape in Derbyshire/Cheshire. If you get the opportunity try the Ghibli, which also comes with the diesel option. I‚Äôve looked at these on Autotrader but stuck with a 911. By the way , at 70, I‚Äôm with you on the philosophical view of life - if not now when?"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Love the Maserati, I was quiet tempted by the ghibli as they were really reasonable priced and I think good looking cars."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great value, like the Mercedes CLS, and the CL coupe. Personally, I prefer this Mk VI to the much loved Mk V. If fuel bills aren't a big concern, I'd get the Ferrari-derived V8, or the V6 petrol, but as diesels go, this is a good one, like the straight-six BMW diesels. They're a very big car though, at 17'4"" long."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Outstanding content...one of my favourite channels! I'd take a 3.0 TDI A5 sportback over this everyday of the week. Just as pretty, cheaper, more reliable and quicker!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Yes matt 
I love the little drops of motivation and just talking sense in general.
Very inspiring and unique"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I seriously looked at one of these as they are beautiful to look at & ive always aspired to own a practical yet exotic car. The centre stack though just looks a bit too cheap and the V6 petrol just felt ""heavy"" to drive. Ended up buying a 2015 Audi S8. Stunning interior, rides well.and much quicker!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great video mate! I love this car so much, the standard flamboyant Italian styling with a beautiful sound! üòÉ"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"A really nice car, and my rational it‚Äôs simple and not over styled, its just right, I think we will be both sharing similar complements about the quatroportre in 10 years time its so timeless, looks like a future classic for sure, a car I may consider as my next car, tempted by the v8 though"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Matt, thank you for highlighting the experience of driving a Maserati üëçüèº. You are quite right, you only live once and everyone should try a Maserati. It‚Äôs an experience that will always put a smile on your face. My Levante is still available for you to try üòÅüëçüèº. Great review Matt üëäüèª"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I may fall into one of the negative people you mentioned! Apart from the initial cost of the car, why did they sell so poorly? If they were that good people would be on a waiting list for one. How much more depreciation will it suffer in the next 5 years if it's relatively inexpensive now? To me the car is like a stripper, nice to look at but would you trust it! If you are big enough to buy one, then I hope get satisfaction from it! Would you trust it to take you to Spain without having to take a diversion to a local mechanic? Bear in mind you would have to pay that local mechanic to 'service' your pretty thing?! All the best....."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,For me the closest rival for the Maserati is the Jag XJ X351. Both underdogs but both beautiful. As an X351 owner I'm always blown away by the driving dynamics of such a big car. Does this drive as well?
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"That suits you Matt, you wear it very well.  I, on the other hand, followed your advice and bought a 530D Touring as a family ‚Äòwagon‚Äô, and you were spot on when you said the 530 is all the car you‚Äôd ever need - it really is and I should have bought one long ago.  But that Maserati is a thing of beauty and I‚Äôd be very surprised if you didn‚Äôt get one.  
Merry Christmas, 
Andy."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"A mate of mine took me on a tour of their Maserati franchise dealer‚Ä¶ when we reached a new Quattroporte he asked me ‚Äúhow long do you think it takes to PDI them?‚Äù I guessed in hours, maybe a day at a push‚Ä¶ when he said two weeks to fix all the faults from factory I was staggered. However at this age and mileage you have to hope that all this initial problems are behind it‚Ä¶ and what is as pretty for the money?"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Never had a Maser although I've admired the looks for years. Friend of mine showed me his new Quattroporte a couple of years ago - he was so excited! After we'd admired the engine with its red-crackle cam covers he dropped the bonnet. There was a loud sort of tinkling noise and half the bonnet catch mechanism fell into the road.  And the bonnet wouldn't unlock again. My friend began to lose faith in his expensive purchase and finally got rid after a couple of years and about 20,000 miles. It had depreciated by about 60% and he's never looked at an Italian `thoroughbred' since! Avoid - unless you're loaded."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I knew these were good but didn't realise they had the power to turn used car dealers into philosophers üòÇ I was considering ghibli in place of my 4 series when I looked to getting a new car but after driving both, the BMW was just so much better it won over the looks of the quattroporte. As for a long distance diesel you've said it yourself, a 4 pot is all you need I'd personally go for a e class 2.0 fully spec'd and just use it as a tool, sofa on wheels although I do have a soft spot for the A7 with the biturbo üëÄ"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Finally a serious car on this channel lol üòÜ This is kinda the same engine you‚Äôll find in the 2011 300c/Thema. In the Thema you‚Äôll find 190-239hp, the Maseratis got a bit more power 250-275hp"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Fantastic review. Keeping it real and spouting words of wisdom üëè
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,This was definitely an easier watch that swift (even tho that‚Äôs a different series) however such a good well rounded review for someone who‚Äôs after a saloon in that price bracket. Loved the advice at the end as well because my next car I‚Äôm hoping is something special lol.Skys the limit for you matt
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"As a Porsche, MG and Alfa owner, I‚Äôm up for a challenge.
Love your work üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great review Matt. Nice to see a rare car being tested.
I would buy one just to see that badge every morning going to work
Alas my Transit will have to suffice üòÅ"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Personally always found the previous shape, gts to be specific WAAAYYYYYY better looking. Of course the sound is also vastly superior ü§§"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I love your outlook on life Matt. I couldn't agree more. And what a stunning, beautiful car. My mate had a 3200GT for a while and even though it cost him a bloody fortune he adored it. It did for him what this Quattroporte did for you."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,A magic view how most petrol heads must actually feel.  Merci Sir.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Love these and I don't care about the fuel costs of the V8.  It's the parts prices which are usually eye wateringly expensive üòû
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"The infotainment system looked really good, very clear good size screen, nice car overall.

Personally though as a what if guy  I'll save my money and stick with my slightly boring but very practical volvo xc60!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"As usual, I love you comments. And yes, it does look great, but to my mind very slightly better looking than the XJ (Portfolio which looks similar side or from on, but the rear light cluster looks a little like the XF  I like the transmission lever & the screen, but honestly, the interior of an XJ 351 Portfolio or Autobiography, look far superior & luxurious - to an Englishman anyway!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Quite simply a beautiful car! It sounds like a pretty good all rounder. Is it a euro 6 engine? üëçüèª
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,The Italians are making some lovely cars. However I would rather consider an Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0 turbo q4 in veloce trim. I know it is a different class that Maserati But looks so stunning and apparently it is better than a 3-series to drive.  It is rare as second hand so I haven't driven one yet but can hardly wait.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I actually did work for an extremely wealthy family and the husband had just bought one of these, not sure which model but out of all their cars I was always drawn to that. Stunning blue and chrome exterior and a matching blue and cream leather interior, every bit of it screamed out class. He had some stunning vehicles including a ferrari, merc, range rover and porsche which were all top spec expensive models but that car just came out top for me, no matter how much I hinted he wouldn't let me sit in it never mind drive it but I respected that. The noise when he started it and the smell of the leather when I walked past if it was open...I actually think I was in love üòÇüòÇ"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Design wise I think the Mk5 Quattroporte (2004-2012) looked much better in the interior, and I also like the exterior better than the modern one.
But my favorite ones gotta be the Mk3 and Mk4, they looked very original and distinctive from other cars

But this interior is also nice and looks luxurious, way better than the Ghibli interior imo, cause if you remove the trident logo from the Steering wheel it looks too much like a Chrysler interior"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"This is why I love watching your reviews, great life advise. Just go for it."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I used to own the 4.7 petrol, didn‚Äôt care about fuel costs, it was servicing that did me. Every time I went to the dealer it cost me a minimum of ¬£3K, also although it was lovely there were switches out of the GM parts bin that ruined the overall. Having said that it was a nice car to drive and the engine sounded very good."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Absolutely spot on about the risk taking part. So many people that have no business telling you what to do, giving their unsolicited advice whilst driving a 30 year old Toyota Scarlet because ""it's so reliable"". Bought an ""unreliable"" E92 335i a few months back and haven't regretted it one bit. Great video."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I can't believe my eyes ! A Maserati on High Peak Autos - What a beautiful change, and 10/10 about life's philosophy Matt, people need to hear this more. Cheers"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great to see you in a diesel and having such fun , beautiful motor that I wouldn't be afraid of owning if only I could afford to trade my Golf in ü§£
Try not to judge other road users for what they're driving mate.....they could well be one of our nurses saving lives and then going back to her cold flat with no food in the fridge üòü"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Matt the philosopher! Love it. I shared this with a mate in Melbourne who really, really wants a Maserti, but the issue about balls is a real one for him. Well done, great genuine review"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"What a car! The Italians know a bit about style, good advice too, life is short, take a chance once in a while!"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great review Matt, and your thoughts on life, well said mate üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Gorgeous car, top review, spot on life advice üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"The best name for a car ever along with the Jenson Intercepter. Great lines and a purchase made with the heart. A car is not just a piece of metal it has character and traits just like a human, give it the love it deserves."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Stunning car despite the parts bin construction. I once got waved on by a Maserati driver whilst on my ZZR1400. He was clocking about 120 mph at the time. Wouldn't have happened if it had been an Audi driver üòÇüòÇwho would have tried to outrun me. ü§êü§ê I suspect that most Maserati drivers are real enthusiasts not badge flashers. Another car on my wish list. üòÅüòÅ
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,The previous generation of the Quattroporte is even better for my taste. ESPECIALLY the V8 version. Italian beauty all the way. Would love to see it in one of the episodes.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I've just looked up a few prices for consumable parts for this car:
Adjustable shock absorber set: ¬£1000
Rear shock absorber bush: ¬£69.95
Rear wishbone kit: ¬£817
Front left hand suspension kit: ¬£1060
Left hand rear silencer: ¬£1810
Just pray your gearbox doesn't pack up."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Beautiful looking car my friend has a 2015 one in a Sharp electric blue looks stunning and he says it's fantastic on fuel ‚õΩÔ∏è Beautiful to look at matt I think its one for you save you putting miles on ya range rover and keep some pennies in ya wallet keep the videos coming üëç
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Beautiful car Matt enjoyed your content as always üëç
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,It's a really handsome beast that. Probably needs a v8 for the ultimate coolness but can see the appeal of the diesel. It's much more interesting than a 5 series. Running costs (servicing and repairs) are going to be high so it's probably best seen as a 25-30k car (20k plus an extra 5-10 set aside). That won't even buy a honda civic these days. Know which I'd rather have
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"üé∂‚ÄùMy Maserati does 185, I lost my licence so now I can‚Äôt drive‚Äù üé∂  A perfect review Matt, I love the car and the philosophy too. üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Great review‚Ä¶even better life advice!! Love this. Thank you.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Matt I really liked the sentiment behind this video, and it was perfectly timed for me and really struck a chord. Thank you üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"I actually considered the same car last year  but went for the E class coup safe bet after, wish I ticked the Italian box now tho.... One life!.
Great vid Matt üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"How‚Äôs the exhaust note on the diesel vs the petrol? 
If I‚Äôm not mistaken I also think the Ghibli has a nicer exhaust note to the Quattraporte"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Hi Matt , wonderful video , as always . I derived as much pleasure from the car , as I did your spot on take on the gift of life . Correct sentiments , beautifully made ."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"As handsome as this is, an X300/308 XJR still wins in the looks department for me. Another really entertaining review, thanks :)"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Given a üëç before even statting the video and damn I was right. Love Maserati, always loved them, and this video is no exception. Soecial thanks for the ‚Äúwe are here for a good time, not for a long time.‚Äù sentence. Absolutely true. Thank you for your work Matt! Cheers.
(Btw I am a Lexus driver, not even some italian fan boy. I just appreciate rarity and style)"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Always loved a ""Masa"" always way too scared to consider owning one,so thanks for your insight and encouragement. Now all I have to do is find one!!
Great presentation."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Great review. Parallels with when I bought my Giulia earlier this year. Could have gone German and people saying ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Young lad at our place recently bought a Maserati Levante (warm sea breeze I think lol) with the 3.0 V6 twin turbo petrol, 450 ish bhp. Took me out and it‚Äôs quick for a huge SUV. Downsides are the shocking mpg, he‚Äôs had it down to 4.6!!!!!! 11 round town and 24 on a run lol"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"From the perspective of a life long Italian car far I don't think I could ever buy a diesel Maserati, it'll have to be the V8 petrol as that particular one is one of the best sounding ever. Then again I can afford neither and an ancient Alfa Romeo is about as far as I can stretch... Anyway Italian marques will always be cooler than Germans despite what the masses and sales figures tell you."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Well said about short life and taking risks. That car makes sense on so many levels‚Ä¶ park the head in a lay-by and take off with the heart‚Ä¶
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Philosophy over substance!
Great review Matt üëè"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Son in law has a Ghibli 3.0 diesel It‚Äôs a beautiful car from whichever way you look at and it does drive really well. It stands out from the crowd!
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"We have a  2016 Ghibli S 410bhp petrol V6 twin turbo. It is amazing. 30mpg.on a run. Leather is super soft, seats amazingly comfortable. ZF gearbox is silky smooth. Double glazed windows. The cold start is spine tingling. The buttons have no relevance to us as we enjoy the drive. Ours has split fold rear seats. We did 17000 miles in the first year and will do that again this year. Buy the S and the weight takes the edge of the performance. You will not regret buying the S."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,I‚Äôve loved Maserati ever since my uncle had a Merak when I was a kid.  I‚Äôll have one some day no doubt and most probably a QP!  Keep the videos coming!
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,I finally got that maserati review I‚Äôve been pestering for ü§£. Hope you enjoyed it!
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Watching from Ireland, great video Matt, thoroughly enjoyed it. Surprised you didn't mention the Aston Martin Rapide in your list of comparisons?"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Spot on fella! - Matt well done for the 'give it a go' lifestyle choices.  Couldn't agree more :-)
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,I must admit i agree with your sentiments and i do love the Quattroporte BUT for those same reasons i would pick an Alfa Romeo Giulia..
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Hi Matt it‚Äôs a great car definitely in a class of its own and now with a diesel engine will make it quite affordable and with a touch of class more so then a Mercedes bmw  or Audi great video sorry didn‚Äôt realise it was you this morning in Marple  until I saw your reg hope you are well best wishes ian
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,I always thought the previous shape before this one was the most beautiful saloon. It was meaner looking and seemed like an erection on 4 wheels. This model is more of semi-on but it‚Äôs still cool x
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Hey Matt! - that accelerations pretty impressive!  It will just about keep up with a Fiat 500 E....!!!!
.....and, what with the practicality, low insurance, ved and maintenance costs - and good residuals...
....this car is a no-brainer(as the kids like to say ...!?).....!!!!
Let's have more of the same ...."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Great car but prefer the Ghibli. Would make me feel good driving it.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Its lovely and I‚Äôd have one but I think the 350CLS Shootingbrake is both prettier and more sensible
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"It has some lovely lines, and I'm sure it looks better to see in person; but to me, with the shot I paused the screen on at 1:30 , the front of the car just looks like it's a cross between a Volvo V60 and a 3rd gen Mondeo with an extra chromosome. However I love that it's a diesel. A diesel made of petrol engine parts no doubt with a bit of soldering to seal the gaps where the spark plugs are usually placed..."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,i  dont know how they can make a 4 door saloon that sexy. love the content matt.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great review! And always try to live by the ..""We're here for a good time not for a long time"" mentality... üëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Looks so much better than the predecessor. Relatively discrete too. With normal wheels and in an appropriate color a great buy!
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Loved the review, always look forward to a new review!üòä"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Awesome video and great advice my friend  I have been seesawing on getting a used Volvo CX90 Black on Black, however I was doing the ""whatif thing"" for months now.  This video has shown me to stop being a wanker and go out and get what you want(I  can afford it).  Anyways thanks so much for the great advice ...Cheers"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,8:00 - 8:40 came for the car review. Stayed for the motivational speech. Fair play. So true with what you said
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Lovely looking car. What do you think to the Ghibli? They‚Äôre just as nice looking in my opinion and you can get a newer one with lower mileage and the same engine as this for about the same money.
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Stunning car Matt, yep you have to take risks in life."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,I've been looking at the Quattreporte with my imaginary budget for about 10 years nowü§£ü§£ü§£
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,Great video Matt. Entertaining as usual. Here for a fun time not a long time makes you thinküòÅüëç
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Idk, this model of Quattroporte is too common I think, I see a few of these every day. If I owned a masser I'd want it to be rare. I'd also expect a maserati to be pin sharp, like a Ferrari, and I'd want the Ferrari V8 too."
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Lovely looking car,  even the interior was very acceptable to me. But what were those small, circular things on the front grille (towards the outer edges, low down), are they the parking sensors but just in a really odd location?"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,"Great video, lovely looking car, would be interested in a comparison between the old shape (No diesel I know) think they look really special when you see one on the road they've aged really wellüëç"
2,bs1bN3c0mY8,You make some very good points and honest as everüëç
