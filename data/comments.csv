1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Hi, check out our artists FAVORITE VIDEOS http://bit.ly/3P8ss10"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,a bunch of people are gonna say: can we appreciate how much effort msa puts into their videos and this artist needs a raise
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an Indian girl.. YES. i loved this! The school uniforms, the people‚Äôs dresses, and the mom‚Äôs outfit- Y.E.S. that‚Äôs real."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,The fact that her mom finally chose to put her daughter and her career first is a very fresh start. Loved this MSA
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an indian, this is the best msa story i have ever seen: the detailing, the characters- AND OMG THE STEREOTYPES ABOUT MARRIAGE AND  WHATNOT!! so proud of msa, so proud"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I love how ambition and focused Niha is and how she never let anyone discourage her.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"This story is similar to the real life story of Geeta Kumari Phogat who won India's first ever Gold medal in wrestling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. She's the first Indian woman wrestler to have qualified for the Olympics.‚ò∫‚ù§‚ú® üáÆüá≥
I'm really proud to be an Indian. üß°ü§çüíö  Great work MSAüòç‚ú®"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I love how they're making more stories with this artstyle,and also stories with MC's who don't only focus on and care about love"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Wow, the plot twist was impressive! This time, MSA didn't give any hints to the villain and I was totally taken aback by the plot twist. I didn't even expect it at all! The background music made it sound like a movie. Keep going, MSA, I believe your team will soon create a whole movie! A few months ago, I'd predicted that your channel will grow to 13M subs next year, but I was completely wrong. Now I predict it will go to 20M on Jan. Good luck!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Let's love the way the story is animated perfectly in accordance with Indian cultures
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an Indian... I have to say that great detailing... The school uniform, police uniform and surrounding... Good work MSAüòç"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Can just take the moment to appreciate how much effort and time msa puts into their content for us üòã
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"MSA, give your animators a raise ASAP."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I love it. A story that doesn‚Äôt focus on the male lead making the female lead fall for him, instead, it‚Äôs about Niha‚Äôs growth and courage."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an indian, this is the best msa story i have ever seen: the detailing, the characters- AND OMG THE STEREOTYPES ABOUT MARRIAGE AND  WHATNOT!! so proud of msa, so proud"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I loved how Niha followed her own dreams without letting anyone tell her what she can and cannot do anything she wants. We need more stories like this!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,*Let's be honest we always love the story when it's this style.*
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I love the diversity, especially with this art style! It comes together beautifully."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"This was REALLY inspiring even though im not into wrestling i really wanna try sports but im mostly into singing and dancing but thats just a silly dream. What i feel i would be in the future is a detective, photographer, or a director"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I loved this so much!
An Indian girl who doesn't need a man and does what she loves while also trying to fix her and her mother's relationship"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Niha & her mom are just the perfect example of the best bond of a daughter & mother after stuff got better, although they had completely different opinions before Uncle cleared up the stuff, yet she cared much for her being only just a single mother supported her etc. 
 Uncle Raj was a great person as well, coolest person def ü§ë"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Love the diversity, animation, and plot line in such awesome detail! Great work, MSA!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"yes i love this athlete representation! we don't have a lot of time for love/dating, so it's nice to see a story about it ‚ù§"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,*Let's take the moment to appreciate how much of time she puts into her content for usüòÄ*
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Niha & her mom are just the perfect example of the best bond of a daughter & mother after stuff got better, although they had completely different opinions before Uncle cleared up the stuff, yet she cared much for her being only just a single mother supported her etc. 
 Uncle Raj was a great person as well, coolest person def ü§ë"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I adore that art style. I noticed that lately they've been focusing on making a lot of stories other than romance. They used to make only love stories in that style, but now it's even better bc it's not just about love and romance. Great job msa!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Let‚Äôs appreciate how much work and effort MSA puts in her videos!üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"You really showed what the Indian's belifs are for the girl child till now. Everything was perfectly described and this video made me proud. Thankyou for creating stories out of India too, keep up the great work MSA!üòÉ‚úåüèª"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"10:53 ""Ran away with the prize money ~without me~""
I really love these tiny little jokes and details msa puts in their stories"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I wish MSA had more cultures and styles in videos but Im proud of how far this whole animating thing has come to
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I'm so happy that in the end her mom decided to be supportive, I'm glad that this story had a happy ending. But unfortunately a lot of times most parents aren't supportive of their children and try to push their own dreams and goals onto them, but we shouldn't do something like that. We should be supportive of our children, believe in them and cheer for them. Anyways overall this story was really very great, can't wait for the next video. Also btw can we just seriously take a moment to agree that we all need someone like her uncle Raj in our lives?"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I loved this story and the art style it was beautiful!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Can I just say that  she might take so much of her time for us everyday and she makes us all happy I'm crying with happy tears right now
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Can we appreciate how hard MSA works to do a 12 minute video more then I could do in a year
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"oookayyyy,,, this episode is officially one of my favs! The artstyle, the plot twists,everything!!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I'm not a wizard or anything, but I'm pretty sure some is going to say: ""Lets appreciate the time and effort they put into these animations for us."""
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Daaaangüò≥
As an Indian, I really appreciate MSA for all the detailing! I mean like- look at those details!
The police uniform! The Indian clothing, The surroundings, the atmosphere, even the names, EVERYTHING! Is just so perfect! It represents India & Indian culture well!
Great job MSA! ‚ú®"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,The amount of videos of this animation is increasing and I love it! Great video
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an Indian, the way she said Diwali was hilarious üòÇ"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,This story is amazing and I love her relationship with her uncle Raj. He's so supportive.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Niha & her mom are just the perfect example of the best bond of a daughter & mother after stuff got better, although they had completely different opinions before Uncle cleared up the stuff, yet she cared much for her being only just a single mother supported her etc. 
 Uncle Raj was a great person as well, coolest person def ü§ë"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I have done wrestling for 4 years for my high school and middle school and people thought I couldn‚Äôt do it and I wasn‚Äôt fit for wrestling and I proved them wrong üòá
Now I‚Äôm really good at wrestling and made it too state finals"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"We all Love MSA, don't we?
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,This is such a amazing story and this tells us that never give up
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Hats off to the people who did the animation I am a fan of msa because of its story telling and amazing animation and of course the voiceover I want to become an animator too and your work inspire me looooot  great work msa team üòä keep posting these amazing videos ‚ù§
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I have to say, this is probably the best msa video that i can remember watching. It‚Äôs detailed and has a ton of diversity, and it‚Äôs not all romance but kind of a mystery and trying to build nice relationships. I feel like the others are usually either about a girl who is fighting for a man with her enemy, or she falls in love and a sibling gets jealous or the sibling is the favourite child or whatever. I think this, however, has more detail and effort and is just so amazing that i‚Äôd watch it again."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"*Don't lie, we all love this genre of animating*"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,As Indian I am so proud of this animation and the story
1,EET-_0SxU3k,the fact we got so much of this art style!!‚ù§Ô∏è
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I like how her mom at the end supported her bc any mom would just to make her daughter/son happy, every video of MSA really gives life lessons"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an Indian, I have to say this story is amazingly on point and it‚Äôs relatable. Love it."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,As a indian i really like the detailed design of every characters and i relate myself when aunty says about marriage things ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1,EET-_0SxU3k,We all know this artsyle never dissapoints
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I love this art style so much, growing up watching your nice videos, you made me open my passion for art! Love u MSA!!!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Let's be honest we always love the story when it's this style.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an indian,I feel proud of msa posting more and more indian videos ‚ù§"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,As An Indian I Appreciate Everything You Have Done A Very Good Job With The Details üôÇüòâ
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Being an Indian and a women I am proud of what msa has showed about the hard work of women wrestlers
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Niha never gave up on her dreams. She didn‚Äôt care what others think of it and she worked hard and it paid off. Also if you realize she had a poster of the undertaker in her room at 2:49. I‚Äôm probably thinking Niha‚Äôs favorite WWE wrestler is The Undertaker. Also her mom looked like a yandere at 5:36.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,90% of the comments will say that this art style doesn't disappoint us
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Can we just appreciate how they research India just to make this amazing story
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Can we just appricet  how Niha learned how to stand up for herself
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I've been watching you guys for 3 years and I love the story
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Very good job fellows!! Congratulations.
Niha & her mom are just the perfect example of the best bond of a daughter & mother after stuff got better, although they had completely different opinions before Uncle cleared up the stuff, yet she cared much for her being only just a single mother supported her etc."
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an indian,I feel proud of msa posting more and more indian videos ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,10:09 true indian moms would never admit that they're wrong üò§ but still u could never stop loving them
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I watched an MSA video which is posted an year ago. After, I watched this video , I just couldn't make myself not to appreciate the improvement in MSA. GREAT WORK üëç MSA"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I adore this artstyle, and as an indian, this looks sooo accurate!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,This is the 3rd one that I've watched your episode with a fantastic ending without any romantic wattpad type of story. Amazing üëç and I like it.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I really love the role for Niha, how she didn't listen to anyone and followed her dreams of wrestling,   very inspirational, thank you MSA!!"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,This was a good story and the animation was brilliant!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I feel like I just loved watching this new story so much cause this new story was AMAZING!!ü§©üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•ü•≥üéâüéä‚ú®

1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Don't lie, we all love this genre of animating "
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"As an Indian, I'm very proud That in some stories there are Indians"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I know this is about wrestling but this kind of gave me motivation to chase my dream as a model
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Beautiful artstyle with great character designs!!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,With this story i remember what i watch on netflix it is also about a girl (a  wrestler in india)‚ô•Ô∏è and a combination of a story of a girl who want to be a pilot. all of them  based in true events/story.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I'm not a wizard or anything, but I'm pretty sure some is going to say: ""Lets appreciate the time and effort they put into these animations for us."""
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Ill only ever watch msa if its this art style ‚ù§‚ù§
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I love this Indian styled story , smazing work MSA .
Proud to be an Indian üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I‚Äôm an Indian and it‚Äôs true how Indian parents are but ‚Äòmarriage can wait‚Äô ‚ù§
1,EET-_0SxU3k,Love it this MSA got me laughing the whole thing till the end man I wish I could see that finishing kick man well dome as always msaüòÅüëç
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I have to admit it.....the story line....the dresses....the background.... all above that the dialogues.... used for making us feel that the story is from India and for India ..... INCREDIBLE üòçüòç
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"That was so cute, Im not Indian but showing your culture is one of the best things you can ever do! Thank's for making thiss"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"I must say, that was an amazing story"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,I love MSA y'all are so talented and creative GOD BLESS MSA
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Im surprised that when msa always posts new videos it always has millions of views, its about what they do for us is really nice! üòÉüòÉ heres a pudding or flan for msa üëâüçÆ"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"When you realise the main character's name was actually Neha and not Niha, and the boy character name was Rahul and not Raulüóøüëçüèª"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,as an indian I LOVE THIS and even my mom has a 10 year younger brother named raj‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ WHAT A COINCEDENCE
1,EET-_0SxU3k,This was an amazing story!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,MSA makes the best videos! I can't wait what's next!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Your videos are incredibly good at negating physical pain. I'm not joking, I had terrible stomach pain and pain killers didn't help at all, so I turned on YouTube to put mind somewhere else and stumbled upon this video. It was so efficient that I can only describe the rest of the time before the arrival of the ambulance as ""discomfort"". It's something about your ""flow"" of narrative, it's so relaxing. Thank you for this video"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Aww, this was the sweetest story ‚ù§"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,i do love this kind of stories where there is not a love story between lovers but between family. family is really important for us and we need to appreciate every second with them
1,EET-_0SxU3k,as an indian... i absolutely LOVED the story!
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Make more of these videos, your doing a great job"
1,EET-_0SxU3k,congrats on 15M!! You guys worked so hard and definitely deserved it.
1,EET-_0SxU3k,"Grats on the 15M subs, it looks good on this channel. üéâ Great story by the way."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Hearken to my words noble ones! Today Shad and I join forces to fight inaccuracy with this new EPIC collab design! 
https://metatron.creator-spring.com/listing/metatron-and-shadiversity-epic?fbclid=IwAR2OivthCEuwtwNtLSXO6F0MOG8pNkDGzMBDBjupKYUANKGhyPrQKhGF4ek"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"As someone writing a novel about Carthage and the Third Punic War, this drives me mildly insane. 
This is not representation. This is exploitation."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I would genuinely love to see more African history shows. 
The sacking of Timbuktu during the kingdom period would be a good setting. 
Maybe about the people who rescued what they could from the library.
Also a bit of history on the people who burned it."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Meanwhile in a parallel universe where the scenarists aren't bigots when trying to justify Dido's skin color:

""So Dido's backstory is that she was enslaved and was owned by a cruel roman lord who treated her poorly, killed her family, and used her for s..xual pleasure. She could barely escape and she now seeks a way to avenge her and her family. She also wants to free the other slaves owned by that evil roman lord who are her friends. Naturally, she hates romans above all, and it is her endless hatres that drives and motivates her. One day however, her prejudices are challenged when she meets a roman legionnaire that was spared so that he could betray the roman army. This roman gradually sympathizes and Dido slowly and unknowingly falls in love with him. Eventually they make out, close to when the season ends. In the very last episode however, when Dido is finally one last gladius strike away to killing the evil roman lord and be avenged, the plot twist reveals that the roman legionnaire she so much loves is actually the evil roman lord's son. Then the season 2 ends with this cliffhanger, and how Dido handles this situation will be revealed in season 3.""

""Wow, what a beautiful and credible backstory! You also brought in much needed depth into the character! Can you imagine a parallel universe where we had defined Dido by only her race and gender and justified her skin color by saying that she is basically 170 years old?""

""Yeah, that would make us lazy bigots, wouldn't it? But such a stupid parallel universe couldn't possibly exist. Right? RIGHT???"""
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Agreed. If it claimed to be ""historically based"" it should be."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The funny thing is they want to be inclusive about different ethnicities while portraying Romans, a nation that did have multiple ethnicities with many reaching positions of power, as villains. I wonder if they just can't wrap their heads around the idea of an Empire not being pure evil."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The really sad part is you actually could have had a perfectly legitimate African character that made sense with a little creative writing for backstory as Rome was in conflict with Nubia in 21 B.C.E only 31 years prior to the beginning of season 2 (something like say, she was taken very young as part of a Roman slave raid), rather than 160 some years out of date. Want a real shout out to history, make her from Nubia and call her Amanirenas."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Mental gymnastics indeed. I happen to be one of THOSE people myself... who prefers the movie be atleast somewhat historically accurate if they claim its based on historical events.
If they are to make a movie about some kingdom in Africa or China or Japan etc. and all the cast is white, i would equally be like: ''What in the F is that garbage?'' That seems to not matter at all though?!"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I heard the historical  advisors walked out on season 2 due to the writing team wanting to make their ""ideal history"" if I remember correctly"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The sad truth is that in the name of representation, they swap out characters as though there were not a multitude of actual stories to choose from. This is either because they do not know this is the case (meaning they are grossly ignorant of history), or worse, that they only see legitimacy in tokenizing stories of ""accepted"" ethnicities (which would be actual racism).
The reality is that if we could trust them to get the story right and handle the source material correctly and with care and respect, we all would love to see stories that delve into the rich histories from around the globe. Give us a show accurately depicting the Inca... the Maori... the Inuit, the steppe peoples... the Polish/Lithuanian/Teuton conflicts... the people of Cush... there are so many peoples and places to choose from, each with intrigue, conflict, and enough action and drama to keep any male riveted (because butted mail just won't do). We live in a day and age where access to these histories has never been more accessible... And yet has never been more deliberately ignored."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The moment I sorta got fed up with the whole Dido plot was when they, through 2 entire episodes, had a big plot to try n save her from her wounds and making it seem like we should really care a lot.... only.. we were never really introduced to her. No ""This is why she's important"", no character building etc. I had no relation to her, meaning, to me, it was simply a character to fill up a few holes and trying too hard to make her seem important, where loads of other characters with more importance and screen time, die like flies and no body gives a shit."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"As a North African, I am sad that our people are not represented very well or often in the media, I never see a proper representation of an Amazigh character :("
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Hail to Metatronus Nobilius Primus! Defender of Historical Accuracy! Proud are we all to be in his Legions!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Another point in favor of historical accuracy:

The majority of the population does not learn about history from books anymore, they do it from exactly these shows and movies.
That's why there are experts on those fields in the first place, and repeating the fantasies leads to distorted views, like believing the past either being too barbaric or too modern.

And it is not just history. I have seen the excuse ""It's just a show"" also a lot on comments pointing out physical or scientific inaccuracies in Science Fiction or even logical ones in Hgh Fantasy.
It's all the same there, minus the '-ism' accusations as long as you don't talk about people. (They may call you a smartass, nitpicker or nerd instead)

This is basically anti-intellectualism, because people can't live outside their feel-good bubbles anymore, let alone admit mistakes or gaps in their knowledge."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Well done Metatron, you always seem to make the point of saying what I was already thinking.  Thanks for being you."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I agree with at least 95% of what Metatron says although I will say that those people claiming homosexuality was known to be common and prominent in Greece and Rome are jumping to quite a conclusion since the clay vases & remains of such that we have from that time period depicting Roman life had only around 35-45 vases depicting homosexuality on them, out of a collection of at least 10,000 vases discovered from that era. That‚Äôs hardly ‚Äúprominent‚Äù, ‚Äúcommon‚Äù, or ‚Äúwidely-accepted‚Äù, by any stretch of the imagination."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,You've got balls to tell the truth! Kudos sir!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,We should all bow down and give thanks that we get to witness the greatest and genius that is the Metatron!!! He is undoubtedly the greatest human being to ever exist and we are privileged to listen to his unfathomable wisdom!!!!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"No, there were no black people in Carthage. The quoted poster is right. There was very little contact between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The only way would have been through Egypt. If any woman with Black ancestry had lived in Carthage, she would have been mixed with Phoenicians to such a degree that she wouldn't have any Black African features left. People with less than 5% of a certain racial type simply don't look like this race anymore, but more like the 95% of their other ancestors.

Black Romans are another modern myth. In Latin there is not even a word for Black people. The darkest people Romans had ever met were Ethiopians, so dark-skinned people are called ""Aethiopes"" in Latin. Ethiopians are not 100% Black, but something in between Semitic and Black people.
The only chance that Romans would have had to make contact with real Black African would be the Nubians living in Upper Egypt and Sudan (Kush). The existence of this land was known to the Romans, but southern Egypt was never part of the Roman Empire. Rome only conquered the northern part of the Ptolemean kingdom, whose population looked more or less the same as today's population of Lower Egypt. The fact that Latin has no word for the Nubian people is another proof that Romans made no significant contact with them. The Romans had heard rumors about black-skinned people, but they were not part of the Empire. The darkest people Romans were aware of and had a word for were the Ethiopians, a rather Semitic looking people (similar to Arabs) with mostly straight, not curly hair. They were noticeably darker than Mediterranean people, but not Black Africans, as we know them. Black Romans are a myth - never happened in reality. Get this nonsense out of your heads!"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"1991's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves had a far better explanation for how black Morgan Freeman's Moorish character ended up in medieval England in that he escaped from prison with Robin after the latter was captured during the crusades. No one thought anything of it as it made plenty of sense and Morgan's character really added to the cast of the movie.

But this... this strong black Carthagian woman ending up in Germania?? Now that's just corrupted writing."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"There are many historically plausible ways to have black characters in a history show about Europe, but the writers always choose a dumb way to do so."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"There are thousands of possible stories that either haven't been written yet, or haven't been explored, showcased, exposed to western audiences (or international ones). Why do people feel the need to revise ones which already existed from time periods that do not fit our current socio-political views?  If the writers and producers behind these disasters had any talent or creative vision, they might be able to tell a new story featuring roles which help represent people of colour, ethnic minorities, etc."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The reason why people are so reactive to this, is because the common man often looks to media, rather than anything credible, to determine their understanding of history.

It should be required to have a minute-long disclaimer before any ""historically based"" media, noting that it's a work of historical fiction, unless specified otherwise. 

This would at least warn people not to accept 300 (based off a graphic novel), Barbarians, Woman King, Gladiator, Apocalypto, Vikings etc. as immediate fact!  Trust me, people blindly follow movies to a T, and it shows; been dealing with Vikings for an age now.

Granted, you likely won't ever have anything that's 100% historical, but at least make it within the ball park.  Make it cohesive."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,I'd love to see you make a video about what God of War: Ragnar√∂k gets right and (more importantly) wrong about the many aspects Norse gods and culture.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Spot on observation.  It's like Germanicus being called Germanicus before he was Germanicus.  I also have a problem with ""historical"" shows where Vikings don't wear helmets."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"So long as history is blighted by falsehood, Metatron will fight it!"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I wanted to hold off on watching any reviews on the show until ive actually seen it. So I started it and they lost me on the VERY FIRST scene. It was so stupid I turned it off immedietly and thank god I did that. 
I mean seriously the romans didn't notice the germans ""hiding"" on a rock wall right next to them since he wore black paint xddd and they knew how stupid this was since they didnt show it to us so we wouldnt notice how absolutely idiotic it was. Also I loved the fact that they knew exactly where the romans would stand their ground so they triggered a rockfall exactly there... 
So stupid xd"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Metashad sounds like something solid snake would be sent to destroy‚Ä¶

Now I need that design."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Dropped this season halfway through the second episode, seems like I made the right decision"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,It's so sad that we can't get a period-accurate representation of ancient times that isn't trying to push a simplistic narrative. I wish we could get a novel-like Godfather or Shawkshank quality movie or show with complex characters and good writing. These stories seem forever stuck catering to the lowest-denominator viewers.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I think this is the best video I've seen so far talking about this. I like how you defend historical accuracy while also pointing out that there absolutely were black people in Carthage and the Roman Empire. They were a minority but they were there.

One thing I would have specifically pointed out is the long-established trans-Saharan trade routes which Carthage was involved in. People treat the Sahara as if it's an impassable barrier but it isn't, and it wasn't then. There have always been peoples living in the Sahara, who moved from well to well, knew where to find water and food, were accustomed to the hard way of life there. These people passed back and forth, north and south in the Sahara trading goods between the peoples north and south of the desert. Carthage famously imported ivory, gold and such goods from sub-Saharan Africa. Some of this would then be exported from Carthage out into the Mediterranean world. In turn the Carthaginians also exported their own products to sub-Saharan Africa.

So, people and goods moved back and forth. Black people from south of the Sahara would have come north as traders, guards for caravans, mercenaries looking for work in Carthage's wars, slaves. Some slaves would later be freed and become free Carthaginian citizens who could have any kind of profession.

By extension, some black people, once in Carthage, were entirely capable of traveling to other parts of the Mediterranean world. Some of them involuntarily as slaves, others voluntarily as merchants or soldiers or what have you.

I would also say it's definitely not impossible for a black person to have ended up in Germania, but EXTREMELY unlikely for one to end up on the Germanic side, and far more likely for one on the Roman side. Once in the Roman Empire, a free black person could travel anywhere from Palestine to Spain, from Greece to Gaul. An enslaved black person, or a black freedman/freedwoman in the retinue of a Roman patron (freed slaves became clients to former masters), or simply a freeborn black person who was employed by a rich Roman, would go with that Roman if, say, he was a senator who was assigned a post somewhere like Roman-controlled Germania on the west bank of the Rhine. Roman soldiers and officers from more upper-class backgrounds were also known to bring a slave or freedman along to attend them on campaign, so you might actually see a few black people among the camp followers that trailed along with the legions. And a free black person could even sign up to become a legionary himself. Otherwise there was the auxilia, in which non-Roman subject peoples within the empire (or from client kingdoms just outside it) would serve alongside the legions. You would find some black people among them in the North African auxilia units. So in such a scenario, yes, a time-travelling observer in Germania during the time period this show is set might well observe some black people among the legions. But not among the Germanic tribes.

By the way, the reason I mention slaves/freedmen so much isn't because black people were particularly likely to be slaves back then (racialized slavery came later; in the Roman world, people of any color could be slaves), but more because slaves were one of the main categories of long-distance travelers in the ancient Mediterranean world. Slave traders would take them from place to place, by land or ship, from market to market, one trader buying from another, until the enslaved person was purchased at a market. Many black people in the Roman world would have been freeborn, but many others would have been slaves or freedmen.

On another note, it's documented that the Garamantes, a North African people who lived in what's now Libya, that was known for their role in the slave trade, would raid south of the Sahara as far as Lake Chad (where the population was incontrovertibly black) and take their captives back up to the North African coast. Some of the captives would be kept as slaves on the Garamantes' own farms, others would be sold on to slave traders from Rome, Greece, Carthage, Egypt or whomever else would buy. And then, again, once in Rome, a slave might be freed one day (depending on various circumstances) and become a free citizen.

So the idea of a black person in Roman-era Europe is far from implausible. But the Dido character specifically is ludicrously implausible for many other reasons."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Historically accuracy is crucial for education. So please do keep up the good work.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I feel bad for North Africans and the descendants of the Phoenician people. Their peoples history is very misrepresented and unfairly attributed to black Africans rather than their own people all in the name of inclusivity and equality. From Hannibal of Carthage to made up fictional characters representing them in cinema, even though there is clear historical account and statues made in their image. I‚Äôve seen plenty of data that Phoenician people have the closest DNA relating to the same ethnic groups in the Near East as in ancient times. Which would of course make all the sense in the world. Those people are in fact the Lebanese people. These Mediterranean people do not appear to me to be black Africans. I‚Äôm very puzzled why the ‚ÄúHistory Channel‚Äù would depict one of their people as black in their TV show if it‚Äôs about the truth and historical accuracy for educational purposes. Them having a black population shouldn‚Äôt give them the right to rewrite history. It‚Äôs like us all knowing all presidents in America were white men but later in history a film maker and TV show creates George Washington as a black woman because America had 1 black president or a black population. It‚Äôs ridiculous and unfair to the historical facts."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I'm so glad Metatron isn't woke.  Among many things, woke means rewriting history in service of a twisted version of ""fairness"".  Woke is the enemy of truth."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Metatron weilding the spear of unbiased knowledge once again!!! What a legend!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I agree entirely with you. As soon as Netflix said ‚Äúbased on historical‚Äù events they had an obligation to be minimally historical. Of course any dialogue would have to be made up. Forcing black characters into implausible roles is offensive and demeaning to the actors. Ebola Holmes 2 is even more absurd: Moriarty is a black female assistant to a bureaucrat, and a black female Victorian martial arts instructor? Shaka Zulu was a great, reasonably accurate film with lots of black actors including the excellent star. Being racially inclusive can be done with a little thought about what to make historical films about."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"That's probably where representation or die hurts the most, when you create a character that has no purpose and would probably make the show better by getting rid of it and not striping essential screen time to flesh out protagonists at the center of the story. After 5 mins it was clear that she was completely grafted for pr reasons. 
Representation works.... but it became mandatory and burdens some stories who are needlessly inflated with pointless characters. Make your main characters xyz color and LGBT but stop dumping extra weight to shows that will inevitably suffer from it. Oh yea... and stop making the romans stupid ffs, take a page from andor and make the empire scary."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Do they cast historically inaccurate characters just to piss people off?
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,YAY! More Barbarian Season 2 HATE. I love it!!!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Would love to hear your take on Graham Hancock's Ancient Apocalypse.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,I am honestly surprised black actors will take a role being the token black character to pander to the far left. To me that's kinda insulting to oneself and anyone that takes the role deserves to be called out for it and more important is calling out the company paying for it.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"One of my biggest pet peeves is people with no artistic talent or love for history chiming in and trying to dictate someone's art. Be it on the right with their history of whitewashing Western atrocities or on the left with their insistence on representation no matter what. Both sides can suck it. A person's art is their to play with but when dealing in historical events, the least you can fucking do is make it accurate. Literally the bare minimum."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I also feel all this is valid criticism when you take into account that the first season was praised and basked in the compliments people where giving them on account of how historically accurate it was. Dont get me wrong i had many problems but  compared to most ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù trash these days it was very authentic! And the creators of the show were like yeah! We are baddass and made this amazing and realistic show!. And by the second season they are now pretending they necer cared for accuracy.  I have to be completely honest, i loved season 1 and could not even finish season 2 because all the appeal it had for me went right out of the window. 

Im one of those guys that plays Total war rome 2 and tries to have my campaign go as close to real history as possible (ex: playing rome and getting all the real territories they conquered and not going further than them)  so i was excited to watch a show that was for the most part acurate‚Ä¶ just like the magic of star wars, now its all gone."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I have a couple of Berber historian friends. This show is not good this season but their biggest beef with historical revisionism is with Americans describing the Moors as ""Black Moors"" erasing all their history and a massive cultural event for their culture basically."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Have you made a video on symbols and flags of the Roman Empire? If not I would absolutely love to see a video on it. Thanks
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Continue making videos about the season 2 of Barbarians, this season 2 was so terrible that the only thing I like about it is discussing how horrible it was"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"4:42 Speaking of Romulus, have you seen the tv series with the same name? It caught my attention that everyone spoke archaic latin, I think. I would like to hear your opinion."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,You know it's definitely plausible for a Black person to be living in Roman Carthage but it's definitely not the first race I would think living over there. But regardless if there was a Black Person in Germania chances are they be a Roman Auxiliar and not siding with Germanic Barbarians. A better way to write this would have been to say that Germanicus killed her husband cause Romans are Evil and she is looking for revenge. Is still stupid but at least there's no time travel involved.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,I'm not going to lie I would like to see a story set in ancient Ethiopia or about Kushite  mercenaries. I just think that would be an awesome story.
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"What I would rather see would be you tearing apart the ""tactics"" or the lack there of shown in season 2"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Must be hard as an historian to watch such pathetic nonsense show as ""Barbarians"" is. A true insult to any person that has a glimpse of what happened in classic antiquity."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"There are many reasons imo that they dont like making movies about the history of southern Africa. One being they would have to deal w/ the uncomfortable facts of what those people did, which is just as bad if not worse in some cases than what the ""evil whyte colonizers"" did."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"""Emperor Palpatine says..."" literally made me stop playing my game. Was wondering why we were talking about Sheev"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,To be perfectly honest if they made a second season of barbarians it would probably have turned out this way. The retaliation of Tiberius and Germanicus was devastating and wouldn‚Äôt have made an inspiring story
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The tragedy is , with a little attention to detail , we could be praising the series to high heaven. 
Its not a bad concept,  the acting is decent,.. a little less bias ,a little more attention to the details, instead of grumbling about its faults, we could have been praising it. 
Sadly, the bias and lack of attention to details shows they do not respect the people who's hard earned money feed them.
That is their real crime . Disrespect of the customer! Its what most feel but cannot articulate.
The deliberate slap across the face of the paying customers. 
Looks like Netflix wants to lose more subscribers. Go right ahead cretins ,but when the investors start taking you to court and auctioning your assets ,to get their initial investment back..what then?

1,0uFhrrTrT0k,My man! I appreciate the size of the balls you have to come out with these videos. Im so sick of the black washing of historical events!
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"As a fan of historical accuracy, this is all I have to say:
If a historical TV show aired depicting the Mongol conquests, I want the cast to all be East Asian.
If a historical TV show aired depicting the Zulu's, I want the cast to all be Black Africans.
If a historical TV show aired depicting Aztec Tenochtitlan, I want the cast to all be Native American.
If a historical TV show aired depicting the early Rashidun expansions, I want all the cast to be Arabic.
So, if we have no problems with any of that...
*If a historical TV show aired depicting the Romans in Germania, I want the cast to be White.*"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I think it is problematic when these woke Hollywood types keep forcing blacks into European history, like as if Africans didn't have their own awesome history that could be told.  Why not tell real African historical stories?  'The Woman King' was a good start, if not for the historical revisionism around the Dahomey role in slavery. 

How about we tell the story of King Shaka of the Zulu who gave rise to the Zulu empire.  Or how about King Kashta - aka 'The Kushite', who conquered Egypt and created the 25th dynasty.  Or the Nubian Christian Crusader kingdom of the middle ages and their wars with the Arab Muslims who now ruled Egypt.  There are many great historical African stories to be told.  You don't need to force blacks into European history, because Africans have their own awesome history that should be taught.  

But I do fear if they did start telling these stories, they would heavily revise history to ensure no Africans were depicted as anything but perfect.

When telling these African stories, you could film somewhere in African, using African cast and crew.  This will create real representation, promote real African culture (as opposed to what we see in the MCU kingdom of Wakanda), give actual Africans a place in the spot light, generate jobs in Africa, and provide a boost the local economy of where ever filming is taking place."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Agreed.Being a historically based work of fiction does not give you the right to showcase impossibilities,however convenient it is."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I really had hopes that finally somebody would do a TV Series on the Roman Empire and actually make it good.After season 1 I thought that they were going to tweak some details and make it actually good. Oh boy how wrong was I . Season 2 is a pure disaster . Romans are portrayed like absolute idiots and ildisciplined mob and savages hungry for blood, which is not the case. I mean, how do you carve an Empire of this size and might while being stupid and withouth any discipline. I fell in love with Roman history because they were intelligent,brave and inventive peoples that withstood any type of pressure and this TV show gives the impression that the Romans are absolute wankers. And for those who blame Metatron for being racist and etc. , please learn some history. Sack of Carthage 146 BC ( TV show - 10 AD) , mighty germanic women warriors who defeat legionaries, distracting a bloody roman camp to go to the right side of the camp while the barbarians attack on the right and of course there isn't a single roman looking and many more erros. I can't how badly this season has been made . For me it is 1 out of 10."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"All the problems listed here can be solved in a few logical steps:
-The opinion of the person that only uses racism to devalue your opinion should not be considered serious, if your statement is not racist that is. If it is than that's another situation all together.
-If the show based on historical age/event does not said ""This is fictional show, nothing in it happened for real"" than it deserves to be roasted for inaccuracy until there is no tomorrow.
-I am all for minorities being more represented: by making shows about their own history. You want to show Africans as strong and dependable? Create a movie/show about Ethiopia and how it was one of only two free African countries in colonial Africa. Make a movie about Haiti and how they won their war for independence and were struggling until today. 

In the end: I like it how they only do this when Europeans are the main focus. Why not try it with Asians? Try to put the African playing Oda Nobunaga or Sun Tzu and see how will Japanese and Chinese react to it."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"The thing that I don't understand is that they could have come up with at least a more plausible reason. Maybe she could be a merchant, or a roman or just something that didn't involve time travel."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"Maybe you've got it all wrong on the point that she came from ''Carthage'' , since Carthaginians were colonizers, a small group of black carthaginians could have sailed up the Rine and settled somewhere in Germania, where they named their new home ''Carthage'', which the Romans destroyed when they invaded Germania. ü§î"
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"I have a better idea for Dido's character.  There really is a population of Ethyopian Jews living in Israel today.  They could have cast a black female from Israel that spoke fluent Hebrew.  Hebrew is relatively close to Phonecian.  It seems to me that ""black representation"" really just means ""African American representation.""  Black and white Americans alike tend to see Africa as only real or significant in that it's the point source from which African Americans originated.  Bigoted inclusion is worse than none."
1,0uFhrrTrT0k,Thank you for clarifying that for everyone that North Africans come from different backgrounds having talk to modern-day people from Algeria and other countries in north Africa I am glad they‚Äôre people pay attention to such things because it recognizes the historical contributions of many different peoples in that area

1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"She is the deus ex machina. The thing is she could have been justified as a slave captured by whatever slave trader made it to Africa (lots of them did or already lived in Africa themselves and sold members of neighbouring tribes they raided to whoever paid well). With lots of reasons to hate Romans or whatever people based on a freely choosable biography. However, while perfectly plausible, that is so close to modern history of Black people that it likely would not be appreciated by them either. I guess the ""black slave"" character is overused.
So, yeah, what works is placing the show in Africa (North or South) or in Australia for that matter. Or in today's Bangladesh, in today's Sri Lanka, today's Tamil Nadu... but this would mean getting local advisors, local directors, even, maybe local producers. I guess I can safely assume Netflix is a basically all white company with few exceptions therefore not at all familiar with every non-white cultural heritage and unable to depict in an accurate way. So Netflix is using random tricks and tokens to look good. You may see it as them doing more than the others, but it still does not look like much to me."

1,0uFhrrTrT0k,I agree 100% metatron I'm sick and tired of this crap and it's only going to get worse as people JUST DON'T GET IT. They would rather label and fight people instead of doing some research which I find research and self study is really addictive and exciting due to the additional & more realistic and factual experience of the historical event. I prefer real history over movies or TV series despite hitting brick walls occasionally due to missing parts or edited history which will only get worse due to these types of programmes on TV etc. I think these sorts of productions are for lazy people who can't be bothered with the study for example the amount of people who think spartacus (the TV series) is 100% true which it is not due to the biases yada yada but its very intersteing to try and piece the whole slave rebellion together which involves alot of work and research.

1,0uFhrrTrT0k,"It is a silly idea to have a show based on real populations of the past like the Imperial Romans, the Carthagenians and the Germans, and make it totally fictional to those ancient people. One of the reasons the makers of that show used non West Eurasian actors to play roles meant for West Eurasians is that using Imperial Romans or Carthagenians makes it easy for the producers, as Italians are perceived as having black African ancestry, and Carthage was in Africa, and all people in Africa are black. You can't do that with King Henry VIII's wives as it is known they weren't black Africans, and it is set in North Europe, but North Africa, Southern Europe it is okay.
Either way, some sort of bigotry was involved by the producers of that show."

Male names are easy to find, but female ones are quite difficult. I can almost sympathize with the show's writers just throwing such a lazy name onto their Carthaginian character, just because it's so hard (in my experience) to find real Carthaginian women's names. Of course I doubt they tried that hard anyway. But for all my efforts I've only been able to find a small handful of female names.

In contrast Netflix portrayed a Viking King by a black actress in their Viking movie. This was over the top woke, cringe and 100% BS.  Moreover, Netflix is being dishonest. They love to waffle about representation and diversity but keep ignoring Middle Easterners, North Africans, Asians, etc. since they only focus on black representation no matter what.

1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I definitely enjoyed this video. Makes me want to hear what Finn thinks about character design for characters he doesn't know the personality of. Including (possibly) the characters of the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Especially if he reacted to the multiple forms for some characters. Doubt that'll happen, because it probably wouldn't do well with the algorithm, but still."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"fun fact about the DK redesign
it is ment to be a mix between DKC DK and the DK found on the artwork of the original arcade game
that is why he has brown around his eyes rather then black & looks goofier then his DKC version"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I love how DK now actually looks like a grown up DK Jr. having grown up with NES. Seeing him in DKC was kinda weird at first but I immediately liked how bad ass he can be. I'm glad they managed to blend Miyamoto's OG design and Rare's.

Mario's proportions in the video games, is really weird despite it's cartoony visuals. In Odyssey which is more obvious his body looks really weird. It looks cute at first glance but there's a couple of stances where he looks.....

I'm glad they didn't go with the Toy Story/plastic-y look and static face and eye shapes the games have. Even their Smash HD cutscene look likely won't look that good in the big screen."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I‚Äôm very excited for this movie! My favorite Nintendo character is peach and so to actually see her be more of a ruler then JUST a damsel in destress is actually really exciting to me and I know many others! I know many OG fans don‚Äôt really like it but I absolutely love it and I‚Äôve seen many compare her personality to daisy, but we literally got a 2 minute trailer. I think miyamoto will still keep her peachy essence, but have her be more of a ruler which is actually very exciting!!"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I Honestly Really liked Donkey Kong redesign,give me Good Old Donkey Kong Arcade Vibes.:)"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I know it's not a part of the design however I think Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is amazing don't judge me it's my opinion and I'm talking to the other people who contact you
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I love peach so much, I main her in every Mario game I can. I'm extremely happy with how she looks and feels in the trailer and posters. She's the peach I know, the peach I've been playing as all these years, only even more realized"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"So long as they portray Peach as Peach and not Daisy, I‚Äôm ok with it"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Yeah I agree about enjoying Peach‚Äôs character 
Her constant kidnappings in most of the games really affected the fanbase‚Äôs perception of her, and I hope Nintendo will do stuff what they did with her in games like Super Paper Mario and Mario RPG more in the future"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I respectfully disagree with your opinion on DK‚Äôs design. For me, EVERY single characters redesign is freaking fantastic."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Here‚Äôs my thoughts on the voice cast (Couldn‚Äôt really think of anything to say about the designs):
Chris Pratt As Mario 3/10: I‚Äôll definitely get used to it but he does not sound right for the role at all.
Charlie Day as Luigi 7/10: Defiantly fits the role. My only complaint is that at times he sounds like a grandpa for some reason.
Keegan-Michal key as Toad 8/10: Liked the original better but I understand that will straight up kill the dude‚Äôs throat. And he still contains the same cartoony energy in his voice like the original.
Anya Taylor Joy 10/10: I mean Is Peach really that hard to screw up?
Steph Rogen (I‚Äôll come back to rank his voice once we hear at least one line from him)"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"peach redesign looks incredible, the original from nintendo even in the recent games is so boring i think, she looks like a japanese domestic robot that cleans the floor with no emotion, mario always had some emotion"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Good luck to Michael Jelenic( in witch  this his directorial debut [no he didn‚Äôt direct teen titans go to the movies]) and Aaron horvath on directing the movie and thanks , khary Payton  for voicing the penguin king  (for me khary Payton is the Kevin conroy of cyborg roles)"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Mario, Peach, Luigi & Bowser's designs in the movie are perfect in my opinion. Especially Peach & Bowser. Donkey Kong's is the only one that looks a little off, but overall it still looks very much like Donkey Kong.

This Mario movie going to be AMAZING!"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"The latest trailer for the movie started playing right before the video started. XD

If you look closely at the bottom right corner of DK‚Äôs poster, you can see Diddy and Dixie.

Anyway, I am HYPED to see this movie with my friends! We‚Äôll see if it dethrones Sonic 2 as my favorite video game movie."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I think that Peach's poster also deserves an 11 ^^ Her expression is just so perfect X3
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I AM SUPER HYPED like mega hyped after watching the trailer's i was just stuck like i froze of schock and the visulas MMM! Like i could just eat them they are so beatifull! Like Come on look at them arghh they are so realistic and bestifull! Proops to Ilumination for this cuz this is amazing, the voice acting is also preety good Bowser and peach are espacily good with one of them being voiced by Jack Black  so it was kinda excpected but still and Chris Prat well he is suprisingly okay like he isn't bad as Mario but he isn't that good he's just okay and everyone else is also preety good. Overall im hyped super hyped and ic an't wait to see the movie i can't wait to see what the stroy is goona be, what the character are goona be like and if the movie succseds are we goona get a sequel well we can only see..."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I‚Äôm already hyped about this movie. I hope your teammates are looking forward to this as well.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"If they ever make a smash bros movie, they HAVE to hire you as the announcer if Xander isn't up to it, you do it SPOT ON!"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Mario and Luigi, but I love all the other designs! Peach, and Bowser are the best."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Here's hoping the movie turns out to be just as well-received as Sonic's recent cinematic outings. Otherwise, old-school Sega fans are gonna be gloating SO hard üòÖ"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I like how they did the animation,that and when this movie come out I'm going to go see it with my best friend.  :D"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I think mario is more like a normal guy for the context in this movie (he is only a plumber that gets into this magic world)
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"you know....i have this gut feeling they waited until now to reveal the movie so the studio wouldnt have a repeat of the sonic movie where everybody boycotted against the movie until it was too late too change it.

Also when you said that just feels like a ""normal guy"" i think that was the point. mario is supposed to be a stranger to the mushroom kingdom, an ordinary joe who stumbles into this wacky and abnormal kingdom. and while yes the idea of ""guy comes from the real world"" is dull to some (im looking at you arlo), you gotta remember that mario was one of the first in modern media to do it."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I do really enjoy your videos, I could tell that I did when I  just felt kinda sad when it was over"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"My personal favorite redesign is toad.

It looks identical to the games"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I saw the first trailer in theatres and in 3D, and it sold me to go and watch it when it comes out"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I mean I think they still mismatched Mario & Luigi's hair, they're just slightly closer to the same color than in the games. SLIGHTLY, but still mismatched.

Did you watch the Netflix series The Queen's Gambit? It stars Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), and it's clear they wanted Peach to resemble Anya. The very last shot of the last episode of The Queen's Gambit has Anya giving the camera almost exactly the same look as in this Peach poster. Peach just has her hands positioned differently, and is giving a slightly cockier smile. But yes, 1 million percent love this look for Peach!"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Luigi has a lot more cartoony going on
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I have to agree on your thoughts also you forgot to talk about the voices but oh well. Can‚Äôt wait to see the movie
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I absolutely despite the redesign of peach, the textures are good, but the proportions are reaaaaalllly weird same with the face
Also opinions exist so please don't start wars just agreeing to disagreeing arguments"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Peach‚Äôs facial expressions remind me a lot of Lucy from Despicable Me. That‚Äôs not a bad thing, by the way. I really like Lucy, it‚Äôs just something I pointed out."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"14:11 Uuuh,Not really.
In reality,this design of Seth Kong of this movie is based in the Old Design of Donkey Rogen of the 1981 Arcade.
Miyamoto wanted to Give fans the Old Donkey Kong vibes."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I don't know if you know this but donkey kong's design in thus movie seems to take inspiration from classic DK. Especially his appearance in Donkey Kong 94
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"My thoughts:
1. Peach and Bowser are great. Would not change a thing.
2. Mario‚Äôs face is too small for his head.
3. Luigi‚Äôs head looks squashed.
4. Donkey Kong looks off. It is specifically the eyes. They do not feel right.
5. Toad is fine, though I bet people will be able to find plenty of screenshots where a Toad looks soulless with their beady eyes."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Idk why but I just adore the collared shirt that they give Mario in the movie
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I pretty much agree except for Mario actually. I think he deserves the same treatment as his brother.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Chris Pratt Mario still has me worried but other than that the movies looking pretty good. Hope it ends up being
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Mario and Luigi need to be a bit more realistic as the mushroom kingdom is supposed to be wacky compared to the world they are from
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,WOW this must be a nightmare for you to edit man.Great job!
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,From what I heard the hair and facial hair mismatch is from the pixel days. had to use different shades to distinguish what was what and it stuck
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I spent hours of my life stomping...

*Desperately attempting to read the script with his remaining brain cell*

...KOOPAS!"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"i hope that nintendo doesnt dissapoint us
for mario movie 
just like despicable me 2"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Peach looks so lovely.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Peach in the movie just doesn‚Äôt look like peach. It looks like someone with the same body type cosplaying as peach
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Bowser has the best design of all the characters redesign
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,YO! New Super Mario Bros. was first Mario game too! I still have my original save completed from my childhood.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Illumination has the worst track record for all the animation studios. Most agree that the good ones are despicable me and the sing movies. But Illumination actually went all out on this one and I love them for it
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I don't know why they couldn't have stuck to how the designs were. Nintendo had high quality models of the characters already lying around for promotional renders. Why not build off of that?
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to see the Mario movie but probably already got information that you the trailer dropped
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I don‚Äôt really think that he actually watched the trailers(he said he wanted more from peach‚Äôs character in the movie but inside the movie her stern voice while saying ‚Äú bowser is coming‚Äù The first movie and how she picks up that battle axe like a bad### in my eyes he didn‚Äôt watch the trailers
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"I like Donkey Kong's. Usually, he is a big angry brute, but now he's a big playful brute."
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Wait? Mario's mustache and hair aren't the same colour in the movie. It's pretty clear that his mustache is darker
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,I hate Peach‚Äôs design. Her eyes are so closed in to her nose and it makes me just want to stretch them out so much GOD IT LOOKS SO AWFUL UGHHHHHHHHHHH. My favorite one is Toad tho
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,If you think about it...Mario as a whole is an isekai story.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Luigi is the cutest
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,when I think red and blue the first thing that comes to mind is red vs blue. the second is dante and vergil from the devil may cry serirs
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"fun fact: bowser second name kuppa, sound like kupa in polish launguage, and in polish launguage kupa means poop"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,the reason mario feels wrong is his voice actor.
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"Disagree with you on donkey Kong
Game donkey Kong 8
Movie donkey Kong 10....Nintendo should keep the design going forward to new games.."

1,3jARxR-RJ7s,DO THE star-lord
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,Donkey kong looks like a grown up baby kong
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,"How is this overanalyzing? Character design may not be your area of expertise, but you didn't even notice any changes to Bowser's face, or explore the reasons why movie designs differ from the video games because of the broad range of emotions the characters have to express in a film, and you didn't rate the desgns based on how well the designs accomplished that within the medium of film. Instead you based your scoring on your personal sentiments about the design. Decent content, but I think you could have done a more thoughtful analysis"
1,3jARxR-RJ7s,who wants to bet some poeple are still surpised illumination made this the same studio known for only have two to maybe three good movies and one of them being there very first movie

1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"Here is how to avoid uncle:
Back away slowly and do not turn around. Uncle attacks from behind so if your back is vulnerable he will take his chance. Head for the nearest school, playground, daycare, anywhere where lots of children are. Once you are 99 feet away or less then you‚Äôre safe."
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,"I love how he does the ""fake"" run. It just makes the video so much better"
1,Sz6ICT0joBI,We gotta realize how good of a runner he is if he‚Äôs running with a backpack on

Thanks for helping with this fundraiser, sona. Really means a lot as a pet owner."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I just want to says thanks for the long-standing community of nerdfighteria because I‚Äôve probably heard this story at least three times, but it‚Äôs always wonderful. It‚Äôs very much like hearing the stories your friends and family tell again and again"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"the fact that i would try and help so many little kittens if it werent for the fact that im too young to and my moms allergic to cats üò≠
seriously if you can, go do as much as possible to save the kitties, they need you. thank you sona for having such a kind heart towards these precious creatures ‚ù§"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"As a Person Who owns 4 cats, I want to help cats as much as I can. Me and my family try to help stray cats by feeding them everyday so they don‚Äôt starve, and I just want to appreciate you for doing this video, it means a lot as a person who loves cats and animals in general <3"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I'm so glad that you've touched upon this topic. As a cat enthusiast (& previous cat owner) myself, it really saddens me to see all these cats who are incapable of getting proper care. I will definitely be trying to contribute to this <3"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I‚Äôm not a cat person but I feel so bad for the cats thanks for the awareness I‚Äôm gonna donate now
You‚Äôre a great person Sona."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"If we can't donate anything, it's our job to spread this awareness. I am gonna share this video rn."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I'm not able to donate myself but I'm really glad you are spreading awareness on this Sona and I will too. I'm very passionate about cats and I want to help them just as much and thank you for bringing this to your viewers attention as well! I hope you have a good day!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I love what your doing here.
Cats on the street are mostly ignored, and it‚Äôs not fair that most of the time people don‚Äôt care for the poor homeless cats, just the dogs. I love dogs and all but I‚Äôm more of a cat person. I love watching people rescue cats and everyone needs to make others aware of what happens to them."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,This is the sweetest thing I've seen today! I'm so happy that people are finally doing something about the stray cat problem. I know how dangerous it is for cats to be living out in the wild with no protection and it's sad. So I'm glad to see that we're at least trying to make a difference. Good job :)
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I can't donate but I send all of my wishes to the cats that are out there to have a very lucky life.

Please donate everyone :)
Edit: I shared. If you guys can share do it!"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Thank you so much for doing this, Sona. So many cats are in danger and so many people don't care or notice. Thank you once again. <3"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I really do pray these cats will find a home, my cat recently died and it's kinda hard for me to put my thoughts into words but yeah, thanks for helping with the fundraiser."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I appreciate what your doing sm! I hope people donate, I hope we'll be able to donate! Ps, anyone who can, please donate !"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"thank you for making this video üíó we had found a stray cat in our backyard years back. we adopted him and i believe he‚Äôs grateful for us. we also have a pair of siblings, which we fostered a litter, and kept 2 out of the 5 kittens, which were from a shelter. i love them more than anyone can see, and thanks for spreading this."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"As someone who loves cats, the situation of all of those kittens on the streets is heartbreaking. I can't donate, but I really hope those cats are okay."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I‚Äôm feeding a stray cat, giving him shelter, and trying to get him to come in my house. Let‚Äôs give all the cats we can amazing lives!"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I remember getting my 3rd cat, when she was around 7 months old, and the shelter told us she was a stray, and we keep thinking about what she must‚Äôve experienced, I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs safe with us now, shes soon turning 5, and she recently lost a fang a month ago. But she‚Äôs doing great thankfully, I hope to see more people like you sona, you are the reason why I still have faith in humanity"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I really want to save the cats so I‚Äôm going to send this video to everyone I know thank you for making this statement I didn‚Äôt know how much stuff was happening with the cats and the other day I saw a stray cat and I really wanted to keep it but my parents said no so I hope I can help the cats more have a good day Sona
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I LOVE CATS AS WELL! I‚Äôm praying for them, I‚Äôd also like to say I love how you grew out your hair! Might have to update your channel mascot hehe üíïüòä"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,This is so sad. I hope these kittens find homes i don‚Äôt think I can donate but I I will try to tell as many people as a can‚ù§
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Sona! üíó You‚Äôre beautiful and this is a great message! üíï
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I will do my best to spread the word,  and if I can, i will donate! Everyone, please donate and share the video, ok?"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Even if I'm not a cat person, I definitely feel like people should try a lot more about saving cats and just animals in general because they don't deserve the struggle that they go through on the street."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"The amount of strays there are just isn't pretty to behold when they could actually be helped out, I'm glad to know that you're deciding to step forward and spread awareness about the situation.
The line is still perfectly detailed."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,My dad owns a car shop and a bunch of cats come everyday and he feeds them and gives them a place to stay for a while
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Def helping you out and all cats!
I hope my donation saves millions of kittens!!! <3"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Im so glad your helping put to this cause!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I‚Äôm so sorry but I can not donate, though I will make sure to share this to my friends and family. Thank you for raising awareness about this, what you and Flatbush cats are doing is amazing."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Cats deserve more love
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I found a cat on the street, his leg was broken so I feed him and took them to the vet, let's say he's ok ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"There are so many times I wish I had money, and this is top on the list :( I love cats to the core, and I really do hope people help with this"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Just donated, I hope the fundraiser goes well <3"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I wish amazing luck for these cats,I hope they all get better! :)"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,This is a really good cause! I can't donate but I can share!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"As a pet owner, i agree to all of this
Save The Cats guys"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I‚Äôm not a cat lover
But they deserve to live ‚òπÔ∏è"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I genuinely wish I could help. I hope that they manage to survive somehow, some way. I'll try my best to help."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"This is heartbreaking :( A few of our cats are from the outdoors, so we luckily got to save them! I hope that everyone is able to help out a little! I feel the same about cats, so I also have a strong passion to help them! Thank you Sona <<33"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,This is great what your doing! We actually saved a starving kitty so I agree with you!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,WE NEED TO SAVE THEM!!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,SAVE THE CATS!!‚ù§Ô∏è
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Yes,save the cats! Whenever I see cats on the streets,I always feel bad for them. They have to try find food and shelter. 
I‚Äôm currently taking care a stray cat and its has been 2 month,she‚Äôs still here üò≠üíû
She has a small house (ofc, i fed her because she was very skinny when i first  her so i decided  to take care of her) (she‚Äôs really friendly! The only thing I‚Äôm  kinda struggling  is taking the other cats (in total,I have 4 home kittens and 1 stray adult)"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"My mom once found a cat two years ago in 2020. He was a male and it had some broken teeth and a badly hurt leg. We named him Covid. We had him for two months and took him to the doctor to get his leg removed. When we took him to the vet to get his injured leg removed (the bone was shattered) he was fine but when he got home‚Ä¶. He passed away. That‚Äôs the hard part about owning cats. They don‚Äôt live forever. Another time my sister found a kitten that was a few days old and it died after a few weeks. We don‚Äôt know why. It was warm and she had fed it. It didn‚Äôt wake her up when it happened so my guess is that it died peacefully. I‚Äôve lived through so many cat deaths in my family. Most where old age or something caused by old age.I‚Äôve lived through 6 whole cat deaths and I‚Äôm 11. R.I.P.- Layla, Gemini, Stormy, Un named kitten, Covid, and Leo.  Fly high üïäüò¢"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I understand this, I have 2 cats who come to my house all the time hungry, we have been feeding them and taking care of them. Lets do this!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüêà"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,As a happy cat owner this news is absolutely devastating and not many people know about and Sona is an absolute icon to be telling others about this problem!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I hope these cats and kittens are okay,and healthy,I feel so bad..the poor kitties.. this is so sad,bless those people who helps the animals"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I really wish I could help...but i don't have money.... I really like your videos and continue to make good content and hope that the donation will help with the shelter!‚ù§Ô∏è Also my cat was under a persons house and it was crazy hot and they barely survived but the person found the kittens then we met the lady and she gave one to me for free!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I love cats üíï I hope every cat has the same love and care that u give ur cats üíï
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I will help in any way I can as long as I get approved üò≠
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I would love to help these poor little kitties but unfortunately my mother is allergic but I hope everyone else can help üíú
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I cannot donate but I wish every stray cat the best. There are a lot of stray cats in my neighborhood but my neighbors and I try to do our best to feed and shelter them.
1,X0nlLwvts7U,My mom is the absolute W who helps them. I really hope this problem gets solved. Rest in peace to all those poor kitties who passed.
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I cant donate sadly but I hope we can help them!‚ù§
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"Even as a dog lover I still support cats and want to help other animals, and Flatbush Cats is a very helpful to the entire community of cats, and people who need jobs, they are helping everyone"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"The first i saw this discord, I bursted into tears from the cry of the cat suffering since their owners couldn‚Äôt pay the vet to give them surgery. People better see this."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"My kitten was a rescue. im not sure what her life was like before us but when we first got her she was extremely skittish and bolted into the corner if you moved your arm to suddenly to talked to loud. We've had her for a couple months and she's a lot more social now, but she's still nervous around strangers and sometimes my Dad if he approaches her too quickly. I hope all cats can have a happy warm home"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"This hits close to home...
I feed about 7 stray cats/kittens that I can't take inside. One recently got an awful eye infection,one keeps getting pregnant,and one has a lump on her belly. I feel horrible I can't afford to take them to the vet. üòû"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Omg this is awesome!! Thank you for making this  . I actually rescued my cat !
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"my teacher said that when he was out one time he found his cat, Bean, on the sidewalk. . Bean came up to him and started following him around everywhere.
he ended up adopting Bean as his full time pet in 2020."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Thank you for spreading the word!!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Who would have thought this was when she showed her face i like the confidence in showing you face to show how serious you are
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"i agree. we need to save the cats. they dont deserve to live on the streets
ps i hope Yuki and Mocha are doing ok"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I can't donate, but I will spread this as much as I can."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I am convincing my mom to help the cats. I hope I‚Äôm able to help them!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"there should be a cat sanctuary.... the cats are so adorable, but i feel so bad for the many hundred thousand more. Save The Cats!"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"been watching cat stuff ever since i was 9 (im 15 now) and when i grow up i want to be an advocate for these cats who are suffering and hopefully become a cat rescuer, i've been watching Flatbush Cats for a while and its so nice to see one of my favourite youtubers actually bringing attention to this very real issue. Always spay and neuter your cats guys!  Chop off the balls, it's always the right thing to do. BTW another good youtuber to watch is Kitten Lady as she's very experienced and has alot of videos on how you can help the cats in your area!!"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I cant donate but im on full hope hoping the kittens will be safe! I hope none of them will get hurt ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"I‚Äôll see what I can do, this is a problem I need solved. FOR THE CATS!!!!"
1,X0nlLwvts7U,We must SAVE the cats!!!!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,"In my apartment back in 2020, we found a cat hiding in the staircase of the apartment. For about 5-6 days, my apartment was taking care of the cat and we all loved him. We decided to call him spike because he had a little spike design on hid forehead. On the 7th day, A girl from the apartment adopted Spike but she didn't allow anyone to see him. Thn comes the sad part... In November 16th 2022, Spike ran away from the house. It took 2 days to find him. Thn came to November 18, The watchman of my apartment found Spike near another apartment in my neighborhood. But, he was found electrocuted. The girl and her family took Spike immediately to the veterinarian. And on November 20th, He died. I really miss him dearly. I cannot forget him since the day my apartment found him. I will not forget him at all."
1,X0nlLwvts7U,Shared with everyone I knew I hope this helped you!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I hope these kittens get a home üòä

1,X0nlLwvts7U,AHHH SONA YOUR SO PREATTTYYYYYY also I wish I can donate but I can't I don't have money and my parents don't wanna donate (not cuase they hate cats just they don't rlly donate money) :(
1,X0nlLwvts7U,In my neighborhood we‚Äôve saved about 10 cats each year since 2020. and recently we saved 5 in November they were the cutest things so I had to adopt one. he (my cat) had a huge patch of flees.. we gave them medicine and neutered them. Look at where he is now in the span of 3 weeks he‚Äôs in a good home with nice people if we never found them they would all still be living in a garage with junk everywhere.
1,X0nlLwvts7U,this is really sad but I‚Äôm glad people are starting to save them
1,X0nlLwvts7U,thank you for this video! I love cats too so this means alot to me we love u <3
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I really really would help but I‚Äôm really allergic to cats but I‚Äôll tell all of my friends and family! <3
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I used to have a Cat called Sammy and my Grandma Great found him in a tree. My parents came over and helped him down. They tried to look for the owner but they never found them. They decided to keep. He would go to other peoples houses to get fed and he got a bit chubby lol. I don‚Äôt have many memories of him because I was so young but what I remember was him just sitting there and my parents telling me to leave him alone. All they told me there was something wrong with his stomach. My Grandad came the next day to take him to the vet to be put to down. He lived a very happy life and when he went that made me realise that I should appreciate my pets make the most of there time.
1,X0nlLwvts7U,My family who already has 5 cats and are expecting more: *YES*
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I lost my braincells I forgot how pretty Sona was but about the cats I hope they‚Äôre ok. I hope people give them food I feel bad for them :(

1,X0nlLwvts7U,My cat used to live on the streets (I believe) and he came to my dad‚Äôs laundromat and he just became the cat of the laundromat. Then we basically took him home and now he‚Äôs part of the family.
1,X0nlLwvts7U,I have 4 cats and most of them were in the wild when they were little üò¢ so of course ima do this!
1,X0nlLwvts7U,YES WE SAVE CATS
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Steph curry said this video is fake and that he only actually made two full court shots. Still impressive to me.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,very good editing....reminds me of the old Christmas ad (Jingle Hoops) where the ball was magnetically pulled to the hoop. Very good one Steph!
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"He's been hitting half court shots since 10 years old. 

24 years later...."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Over 3,000 3pt shots later.
_""Yup, he's still the goat""_"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I can't even make a shot when im standing directly under the basket.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"the simple fact that we thought ""this could be real"" even for a second says it all"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Look at how the ball bounces away after the made shot, it's going along the baseline until your view is blocked by Steph's body, then suddenly it's rolling past the 45. The lighting is wrong on the ball as it flies past the roof lights on the second shot too, the editor forgot to add the shine on it."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Stephen Curry is the undisputed GOAT shooter of basketball game in the whole wide world!
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Idc aint no way u making 5 in a row full court on point like tht..steph sold his soulüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,So he made 2 instead of 5. So what? Some ppl can't even hit a free throw or a simple layup. He is the GOAT of shooting üêê
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I think steph has a subtle  telekinesis powers that makes any shot he shoots goes in with his mind. He downplays this power by not using it as much in fear of being exposed as a mutant......
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"in reality he made 2 out of 5, the video is edited. Still pretty impressive though"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,A monster üí™
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,With Steph Curry it‚Äôs not Fake but a piece of Cake üç∞
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"I can't believe how many people actually believed this video was real. Steph's the best shooter of all time, no doubt, but c'mon now, use some common sense."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,He's turned into an NFL quaterback.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"It‚Äôs 100% fake. Steph even said it was fake, but that he did make 2 shots"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,ppl say he only made 2? thats still impressive . was it like 2 in a row? cuz that even more impressive
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Even Steve Kerr couldn''t believevit was real
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Even though they're not all true, a guy that can make 105 threes in a row wouldn't surprise me making 5 of these."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,NFL scouts be like: Golden arm! üò±üò±üò±
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,He should just do that in every game
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,And I‚Äôm still bragging about the one I made 10 years ago that I never actually made.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,its okay 2 shot he made is difficult for a court to court the golden hand you have steph
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I find it funny when people fell for it even that they said it‚Äôs rigged for commercial. üò≠üíÄ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Like how he runs up outta there after the last one.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"So, let me get this straight... Stephen Curry can't make a fast break layup or a 3-pointer but can hit 5 Full-court shots in a row??!"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"He shoots from the logo, so if he did make 5 full court shots without video editing, anything is possible"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I don't care if he really only made 2. I can't make any of those üò≠
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Dam.. he  probably be a good quarterback too .
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"He said ""it's 5 in a row"". üòÖüî•"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Nice edit sir... It's like realüòä
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,maybe Steph will show us how to edit videos next time... even live NBA videos... Curry the greatest video editor...
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I heard about this on social media. Amazing!
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,He's built different.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Steph be on the Midorima Shintaro grind ü§£
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It's INSANE that someone can shoot this damn good...
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,‚Äú Is it magic‚Ä¶ or is it MAGNETS ‚Äú üß≤üéØ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I mean damn this has got to be real‚Ä¶üòÇ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Let's not forget he shots from the stands too..Steph really from area 51
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Just thinking out loud: if all those basketballs were actually just green, this wouldnt be very hard to edit, no?"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,rumor has it he came back in the room and made 5 more
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Common sense says he would go for 6‚Ä¶ 7‚Ä¶ etc!
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Man their is a magnet ain‚Äôt no damn way it‚Äôs so good to be true everyone thinks it‚Äôs fake this man just might be the best to ever touch the rock he still young and healthy
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Im mad that its not real because its curry if he practiced it enough its possible he could make 5 hcs in a row
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It's legit he just only say he made 1 or 2 shots out of it to show how he care of others not losing their confidence when they face him in a game.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I don‚Äôt care what Curry said. This is real lol
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Steph said this is fake just so you ya know. He made 2 not 5
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"the way the first ball stops at 0:16 against the wall (as he walks by the frame to cover it) is weirdly fast, but then i figured it could be the foam material.

but then the ball at 0:28 bounced right off of it, so i think editing is definitely a possibility.

someone link the other angle so we can see the balls hitting the wall."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,He using the secret amulet at this point.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Think he has a NFL Qb contract waiting for him
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Surely this is fake?  I mean I know he's good but he's not even shooting those he's just hurling him.  That's gotta be nearly impossible.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"too much Steph, unbelievable!!"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Change your title. He only made 2 for the original, but still impressive."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Just a ""baller,"" playing a ""baller,"" disguised as another ""baller."" Could be real?"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It‚Äôs magnets in those balls and on the rim. Don‚Äôt get rocked to sleep üò¥
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Bro that's not supposed to be possible. That's beyond Globetrotter level üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"yeah, not full full court, almost to free throw line he keep stepping forward"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Old school coaches woulda made the whole squad run suicides for not practicing gametime shots.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It's amazing what people will believe
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Legendary
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Over the rafters, through the window, nothing but net."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Next Jingle hoops (STEPHEN CURRY EDITION)
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Steph: ""To think anyone can make 5 of those in a row is outlandish lol smh.... I did make 2 of them though""

üòëü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ Bro, go home lmao smfh Was that supposed to make my or  the other teams feel safer??.. Cuz it doesn't, JS!"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"So they edited all angles? 
I believe Steph was just being sarcastic lol. How the F they edit all angles?"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,The second to last one was very off and no way was it going in so I knew it was edited at that point
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,its fake but the fact that there's multiple angles of this is kinda scary tbh
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,WE LUV KOBE BRYANT N STEPH CURRY üèÄüçÇüß°
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Does anyone want to argue that steph Curry is NOT the best shooter/player ever?
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Hilarious how many people think this is real üòÇüòÇ. People these days aren‚Äôt very smart
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Im waiting for the comment ""Where is the green guy?"" ü§£"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Start doing that in the game
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I would like to see Steph Curry  against  Snake Plissken... I think he would loss.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I managed 3 in a row from full court and 5 in a row from half court . This is not impossible . I think he tried this months or even years. Actually his shorter distance shots ( I say short distance for a logo shot)  are more incredible as he shoots them like free throws üòÆ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,If you fell for this then you probably also think the Earth is flat like Kyrie.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,I hope I never play Steph in a game of horse.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ üêê
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"this was real. i was one of the division champion signs on the wall, i know"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,This vid is not real because Steph chose it to be that way
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,If this was anyone else I‚Äôd say it was fake. But it‚Äôs probably real being Steph and all
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Needed 100 more but left the game
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Idk how this is fake it looks real to me
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"He said it's fake, but it looks legit. Watch all the basketball placement and shadows."
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,u know its fake because nobody makes 5 and doesnt shoot the 6th.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"Fake..
I bet you Stephen Curry himself couldnt even do this!"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Fake but still amazing
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,That's witchcraft. He's a warlock. It's the only way to explain it...
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Giving off LeBron Powerade commercial vibes
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,the curve of the 4th shot is kind strange
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It‚Äôs called a magnet
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,The Adobe Aftereffects in this video is real.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Lbj faked it first in 2012 so who caresüòÇ
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Best part is LeBron had to fake doing that for a Gatorade commercial and not even from much closer
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,If this is a *_deep fake_* - I fear for our future - because reality is no longer the best version of life.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,"After seeing the first one then this, I now have doubts this is fake. The CGI dudes will have to edit 2 completely separate videos. There'll be a 3rd camera I suppose"
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,‚ÄúHow I fooled the world using fake curry‚Äù yt
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,It IS actually not fake. Big respect.
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Wow. Is this real
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa unbelievable!
1,xt5vzE0QCvk,Is this real?
1,daEv41z14GY,that song will forever be living rent free in my head.

1,daEv41z14GY,okay i just found ur channel but you have NO right to be this good and yet be so underrated
1,daEv41z14GY,"I added some lyrics of my own to it so I can make my cat angry ""when you meet a kitty man, you must shake him by the hand. If you want to pet his fur, you must shake him by the hand. If you want to kiss his head, you must shake him by the hand. If you want to meet his friends you must shake him by the hand."" my cat gets so mad everytime I sing that XD

1,vwbQxMY7yds,it‚Äôs very nice to watch matpat bring in a smaller creator instead of repeating their theory. big respect matpat
1,vwbQxMY7yds,i love how matpat doesn‚Äôt colonize ideas and allows those who came up with these theories vocalize it for themselves
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"MASSIVE respect for not only watching Rem's videos, but opting to INVITE HIM TO COLLABORATE rather than just rehashing his own theories."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Something I just realized is that in the death episode, red guy thinks he should be the one who‚Äôs dead instead of duck. And then in the family episode, duck is so sure that he should be able to open the chips. Maybe then being confident in what should be is another sign of how things should happen for the story to free them."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Editors deserve a lot of credit for these videos featuring guests. Using their unique style to adapt between Mat's cadence and Remy's cadence to deliver an excellent visual story is just so masterful.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"MASSIVE respect for not only watching Rem's videos, but opting to INVITE HIM TO COLLABORATE rather than just rehashing his own theories."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I feel that Leslie (being a screenwriter) is writing for the DHMIS Show but after her accident that killed her son her writing has been drastically affected by it. She has an idea for the show but dealing with her grief makes it nearly impossible to write out a full story which is why she constantly has to ""reset"" the story and start new."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love seeing all the new people matpat is inviting to his videos and his team, they‚Äôre so talented and definitely deserve a place at the theorist table"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Matpat has never missed a fandom
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Can I just say how much of a production this channel has been doing for their intros?? They ALWAYS never fail to amaze me.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I like having someone else talking alongside Matpat. Makes feel a bit more different from usual and that's not always a bad thing.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"So many of these awesome collab style videos with new creators recently! It feels like MatPat is nurturing the new generation of youtubers, in true DadPat fashion - Keep it up!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Another thing I've noticed about the show is that on the first episode where the suitcase calls in his brother Unemployed Brendon he asks Red Guy if he would like to publish his novel which is called the Ultimate Forgiveness. Which means that Leslie has thought about forgiving herself but is in too much pain and can't. 



Which would explain why Brendon is unemployed

Edit: I know it's not really important to solving the lore, Im just throwing it out there"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I was actually worried Rem's work would be missed or only briefly mentioned as inspiration but inviting him in is a HUGE win for a budding theorist channel! This is the Theorist crew I subscribe to (I mean, I've been subscribed but... you get it) Incredible collab!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I love when matpat brings in other theorists to the channel seeing there thoughts on it and trying to make a perfect theory.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love seeing all the new people matpat is inviting to his videos and his team, they‚Äôre so talented and definitely deserve a place at the theorist table"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I didn‚Äôt think my respect for mat pat could grow even more but here it has thank you for inviting rem onto this as well mat he appreciates it and your loyal followers/subscribers thank you for doing that
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Very cool that Matpat has brought more creators in as a new face in the theorist team!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,It‚Äôs lovely seeing Remgames getting recognised by Mat pat here! I‚Äôve been watching his theories the last while and they‚Äôve been really cool to watch
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"A graceful way to handle two creators who find that they've traversed the same path. Nicely done. Good to ""meet"" you, Remy :)."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I'm so glad you're still covering DHMIS because the show deserves every bit of attention it can get and I hope more than anything that it gets a season 2. It seriously blows my mind how much effort and passion went into it. It's hilarious, it's unsettling, and it stays true to the original series' tone while also fleshing out all of the wonderful characters we've grown to love."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Love watching your DHMIS theories!! You should do ‚Äúthe house‚Äù next from Netflix, it‚Äôs a 3 part stop motion movie with a lot of stuff I think you would be interested"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I just love how you two did the theory together, also your meta interpretation at the end, that the council are publishers and there may be the audience above them.
Man I just would love to see another season but that will take years.... for a good reason!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"If its true that Leslie is yellow guys mum, could the repetitions or resets be Leslie attempting to avoid yellow guys death. She keeps playing out the events that lead to the car crash in regret, maybe trying to find a series that would have kept him alive. That makes sense to me anyway.
Then perhaps instead of there being a right order of things to happen that Leslie already knows, the book lists all of the failed loops, helping the 3 characters to try a new one. There are only 3 windows in leslies room, maybe these are the parts she has worked out, but she hasn‚Äôt found the perfect list of events that leads to her son surviving"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"YAYYY you brought rem on! I was hoping you‚Äôd collab, especially once I watched his series on dhmis. I think he‚Äôs an awesome creator so thank you for giving him some of your spotlight matpat! You‚Äôre the best at keep this community growing an evolving so thank you and keep being a good youtube dad for everyone haha!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love how Leslie isn‚Äôt a villain 
She‚Äôs just a woman in grief ANF trying to build her family back"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"So awesome to see new faces on the channels. As someone who grow up with GT, seeing new theorists show up and getting their time in the channel that inspired them is always amazing."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"So many more details I'd never heard mentioned before! New places where the symbols appear, clay hill, the lamp story with the council and the pound.... And the fact that these theories managed to reveal the (discrete) critique of tv executives that was missing from this season, it wraps everything up so nicely it's very satisfying <3"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I am always reminded of an interview with the creators, years ago during the web series run, when they were asked about theories about the show and they said they loved them and that every single one of them was right. With that in mind I think videos like these are both completely right and completely missing the point of the show.  Is there a deeper meaning? yes. Is it a nightmare? yes. Is is just children's satire? yes. Are there answers? Yes. Are there No answers. Yes.
They made a show, very brilliantly, that lets people come up with insane or mundane theories that are all true. Even the ones that seem to counteract each other, are both simultaneously right.
They literally made two series with the premise ""Whats your favorite idea? Mine is being creative""  and then let it loose on the world so everyone can be creative."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,it‚Äôs very nice to watch matpat bring in a smaller creator instead of repeating their theory. big respect matpat
1,vwbQxMY7yds,i love how matpat doesn‚Äôt colonize ideas and allows those who came up with these theories vocalize it for themselves
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"You guys should hire Rem onto the team. He's well spoken, shares a similar cadence to Matt with information delivery and puts a lot of effort into his work."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"MASSIVE respect for not only watching Rem's videos, but opting to INVITE HIM TO COLLABORATE rather than just rehashing his own theories."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,The fact that small creators such as film theory are doing theories with massive channels is very pleasing
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"MatPat and Team Theorist, and Remy, I love the collab!  <3  But the book ... the symbols ... I very clearly see sawtooth, triangle, and sine-waves.  I very clearly see musical notations such as clef notes, neutral clef, whole, half, and quarter note notations.  The book *SCREAMS* music, but not just music, *chiptune* symbology.  And that Yellow Guy is the song, while Red Guy and Duck merely accompany him.  But ... WHY?!?!?!?!  It is such a weird out-of-left-field thing to do.  Yet not only is the story there, but Yellow Guy's battery drain and book shredding fit a plan to escape this kid's musical.  But ... WHY?!?!?!  And why *chiptunes* ?  ROFL  So Team Super-Duper DHMIS Theory, can anyone please please please help solve this mystery?

Also ... why is no one else noticing the chiptune symbology?  I can't find anyone talking about it.  But it's so blatant I can't imagine a world where no one noticed it but me.  Surely not!  I don't even make chiptunes, or music, but I can't unsee this slap in the face to such a specifically narrow topic smack dab dead center on this book of all books."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Lesley is a script editor, not a writer.
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a room above hers. The room above hers is the writer‚Äôs room!

Side-Note:
Notice how Red Guy thinks he should be the one who is dead.
And he is the one associated with the shovel."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I was watching Rem while I waited for this theory to come out months ago, glad to hear he has gathered some attention for this theory! It was a very well put together theory, and helped guide my studies as well."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"This was such an eye opening theory, Mat! Loved it! But.. do you think there‚Äôd ever be a theory on how/if the YouTube series and TV series are connected? Not sure if they are so that‚Äôs an ‚Äúif‚Äù there‚Äôs even any evidence, but I think it would be interesting!ü§î"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I think they have to be nice to get a pound, because the briefcase was treated nice but the others, the coffin was being annoyed and murdered, the family got murdered, the EAGLE got bullied and murdered, the car‚Ä¶ also murdered, and the electric box got her batteries took out, so i think it‚Äôs not what they do, it‚Äôs how they behave to the teachers (also I know the names, but I don‚Äôt feel like typing them in so yea)"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I'm so happy to see Rem get the credit he deserves. Well done!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,It''s very nice to watch RemGames bring in a small creator instead of repeating their theory. Big respect RemGames.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"A few more things about the book cover: we see the time guy down at the bottom. Is he supposed to be sacrificed? And those two circles at the top are most likely not just an artistic choice, but red guy‚Äôs eyes. So does he lose his eyes, or a clay model of him loses them or something?"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I already watched REMGames I actually liked his theories, I‚Äôm honestly astonished that you actually did a collab with him!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"9:27 I can Awnser this.

Duck wanted both of the chuddle dollops in the bag

Red guy was the supposed ""Best Friend"" of Duck at the funeral

And Yellows is pretty self-explanatory"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"""Because of course there are dead children, we have our standards after all.""

Best Line 2022
*This comment has more likes than I do subscribers XD*"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I'm glad they bought Remy in, I had been watching his progress as he made the videos!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Editors deserve a lot of credit for these videos featuring guests. Using their unique style to adapt between Mat's cadence and Remy's cadence to deliver an excellent visual story is just so masterful.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,So if I may throw in a theory of my own: since the batteries were what was needed for Yellow guy to break free of his surroundings and duck appeared so obsessed with the food could each of the items be what is needed to be used by each of the characters to break free of the cycle?
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Personally, I think the windows were about their deepest desires. In the green window, there were the cheese doodles, and duck seemed like he wanted the puffs more than anything, especially at the end. In the red window was the shovel, and in that episode and both with his seemingly growing depression, he wanted nothing more than to be dead. Finally, the yellow window had the batteries, that the old battery yellow guy didn't know he wanted, but the yellow guy inside of him wanted more than ever,."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I love seeing smaller creators like Film Theory getting the recognition they deserve
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I think the sequence of events things need to happen in is related to the actual sequence of how Lesley and David did things. In the short film thing of the place they try to move into in episode 5, Duck's seen as a house pet, but in episode 2, Duck calls Yellow Guy the house pet. Maybe another part of the criteria was Duck being the dumb one instead of Yellow Guy. It would make sense, because Yellow Guy suddenly got smart in episode 6. Maybe that was the role he needed to take to progress the story. Anyway, the criteria was probably related to what actually happened in the real world. Maybe she was trying to get over the trauma by reliving the actual events that happened. That could be what the loop is. Her trying to get over her grief, failing, then trying again, each time trying a different coping mechanism.

Also, in an unrelated thing, I think the Council living beneath the earth might've actually been literal. The car said his special drink was forged far beneath the earth from the remnants of something. Maybe the Council sent all those weird teachers, and maybe the Council were the ones making the special drink. The car also said he wasn't supposed to be out that far. Maybe the Council told him he couldn't be.

Also, another unrelated thing, I think Yellow Guy was alluding to the Big Boys' Rooms in the first part of episode 6 with the crossword. He said something about remembering that above you there are bigger versions of you, then above them are even bigger ones, but then he said there are smaller versions on top of all of that. Maybe there's a smaller thing above Lesley. Maybe that scene was about a memory coming back of a past iteration of the show. Maybe that's from the iteration where Yellow Guy went up the stairs and met the Big Boys."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Omg this episode was a hit! You gotta keep on doing more theory‚Äôs with remy!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I think the chips, shovel, and batteries represent the character's episode. 
In family Duck is very much already for their family unit, and doesn't want to go to the twin's home and is very intent on being the head of the family. He also then goes on about his family, and how he doesn't need them, but it's clear it's his episode emotionally.

The shovel is about red guy's story. It's heavily implied that red is grieving in an unhealthy way. He goes as far as to make the clay monster turn into duck. Red guy can't move on, he wants, or rather needs duck. It's red guy's emotional story.

And the batteries is obviously yellow guy's. His batteries get changed, he goes throughout the house.

The windows are a representation of each of their stories, their most important moments possibly? Maybe hinting at their past."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Well, first off, the thing is that I love how Lesley's not an antagonist. Especially in the DHMIS universe. Like imagine the action that would go down for the entire Don‚Äôt Hug Me I‚Äôm Scared conspiracy and Yellow Guy himself, and second off, I can see both MatPat and Rem solving mysteries over a couple of books and some strange, gory lore behind it in the hands. Plus, I find it fun that whenever a new video comes out you just have this new, special guest featured in it."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I really appreciate when you guys give proper credit. It feels more like a community of theorists.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Actually I think the items represent what the characters crave the most. Duck obviously wants family, thus he gets the item from that episode. From episode 2, we know Red guy really wants to die, hence the shovel and Yellow guy needs batteries to reach his true form, cuz his own batteries are old and don't show his full potential!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Many seem to forget that the Chuddle Dollops were Duck's property, he bought them.
I don't think Red guy opening them means that he's linked to them.
Think of it this way;
Yellow guy owns a pair of batteries in his chest,
Duck bought a pack of Chuddle Dollops.
This highly suggests that Red guy owns the shovel.
Remember that just because a character uses the item doesn't mean they're tied to it.
If we take the logic of Use means connection then they're connected thus;
Yellow guy uses the shovel to dig up Duck(who dies again later on by Stain Edwards the Forever boy)
Duck handles the batteries in order to set everything ""right""
Red guy opens the Chuddle Dollops"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Oddly enough, the YT community talked recently about the whole plagiarist thing going online for awhile now 

I'm glad they are showing this, because I'm tired of being tricked into watching repeat garbage or stolen content that never really reaches the original creator.

imo a YouTube Collab is the whole reason I loved watching this way of content in the first place and then was told about another channel I might also like"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I have to comment just to say I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING THIS FORMAT! Having a guest theorist come on and making the lore analysis into more of a conversation is just wonderful
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love how self aware Matt is, like the password at the very beginning being ‚ÄúYellowGuyIsNess‚Äù in leet speak, amazing"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I'm so happy to be able to now know about RemGames.
Immediately fell in love with their smarts and humor."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,9:58 I agree with red guy. Who else vibes with him not only on this point but as a character as a whole?
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I know I got so impatient waiting for him to answer the question of what was going on in the series I already watched that I'm glad to see that it was valuable for me to watch cuz clearly it's going to be important to this theory
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"The dynamic between having two hosts back-and-forth exposition where you flow off of each others points, is surprisingly REALLY entertaining, you should definitely experiment more with in the future"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I'm surprised no one looked at the symbols and thought of alchemy. Most of the smaller parts of the symbols (like the triangle with a line through it) are from alchemy, and mean something different depending on which way its facing. I also think the larger symbols resemble the sigils associated with demons of the Ars Goetia."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love how matpat could very well just say the theory from a small creator and move on but he doesn‚Äôt, he brings his audience to the smaller creator and gives credits to their theory but also branching off of it a little or putting in his ideas."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Loving this never ending realm of theories about fictional animated characters
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"1:23  I think it was the father who killed David.  That is why you hear her tell her son to look before crossing (which she wouldn't say if she was driving).  It would explain why the father is always silent and seen as a hidden threat, as he was the one who (maybe unintentionally) killed the family (like he does with the donor family... heh heh.. _donner_ family).

I think Red Guy and Duck are Super Ego (awareness of the bigger picture) and Id (baser instinct) respectively, which is why Yellow Guy David sees only them in the higher rooms: they are parts of his mind.

Maybe it could explain the themes of the episodes too.  In the first series, the first episode is about creativity.  Maybe it was David's imagination that brought him from the void of death.  Then you have time and love, a subconscious awareness of mortality and knowing something is missing (his parents' love and the ritual of his funeral).  The computer episode could be him trying to seek out more information to his well being, with health and dreams again referring to subconsciously knowing he is rotting in a grave and having a neverending nightmare due to being dead but not knowing it.

Even the 2nd season deals with issues relating to purpose (jobs), an attempt to understand his fate, escape (to see the boundaries of his spiritual prison) and enlightenment.  Leslie may be a mix of what David remembers of his mother and how he might view his own body (being stitched back together after getting hit face first by a car).  It is not his mother on the (second to) top floor.. it is still part of David's Limbo prison.  Even the bit at the end with him becoming ""stupid"" may be David refusing to accept that he is dead, and he would rather be blithely ignorant than come to terms with his mortality.

The entire story may be akin to *The Others (2001)* from Alejandro Amenabar. 

5:00  boy... it's like someone took ""the Symbol formerly known as Prince"" to a whole different level.

14:14  that will never be not funny.

16:00  _S L I G H T L Y ? !_"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Dang, Remgames is actually super underappreciated! Let's give this man the support he deserves!"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"what i find interesting is how no one's talking about red guy and duck being ""intelligent"" on the second floor...did they gain conscience of days repeating themselves fully and they're trying to solve the code? due to the book being put in the shredder...?"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,i love how matpat doesn‚Äôt colonize ideas and allows those who came up with these theories vocalize it for themselves
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"This is what I think. 
The symbols on the book for Yellow, Duck, and Red look like the characters. Yellow has two dots in the middle of the rectangle and a arrow pointing down. (2Dots = Batteries) and (Down Arrow =  Shovel). Yellow uses the shovel to dig up duck. Who's symbol is side ways, like if you were buried underground. Red symbol shows small curricular hands which represent his mental grasp of of the daily cycle and him opening up about it."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Re: the windows, maybe it could be their desires instead of how things progressed in previous timelines. Red Guy wanted to die. Duck wanted the Chuddle Dollops. Maybe yellow guy wants the fresh batteries, without realizing he does? If he is a kid or has stunted development, he might not understand his own needs in the same way neglected children (many times) self isolate and fall back to unhealthy, known paths rather than grow by meeting the social needs in Mazlow‚Äôs hierarchy. Or how if an absent parent suddenly shows up, there is both resentment and confusion on how to interact with this new concept. 
It could be that duck and red guy both explicitly display their more simple wants, and ‚Äúsimple‚Äù yellow guy has a subconscious and more complex desire to rise above his station. Yet with his crusty old batteries, he doesn‚Äôt realize this want. Or more terrifying a concept, he knows but can‚Äôt vocalize it since the old batteries seem to be a major factor in a learning/memory disability."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Great theory Matt! DHMIS is one of those things that has so many unanswered questions. Next theory I would LOVE! to see a Backrooms theory, the new videos, speaking of them one came out recently 'Reunion'  Lets just say we meet a familiar face again who has turned insane."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I notice that the windows in Leslie‚Äôs room opposite the ones we see Yellow walk past, seem to have the square and circle shapes reversed. If that could fit into it"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I thought this would be more content that I had already seen, (as i had watched rem's videos already) but was really nicely surprised by the conclusion of the theory. The loose piece of evidence that made me questions the name theory before might make more sense in this version of the theory. I'm talking about that the boardgame in family had a layout basically the same as the Red Guy symbol, making me think it might be family instead (that meaning it fits some of with the other instances of the symbol too) but now, with the script theory solidified and connected with the themes of the previous show, I think it might make sense. Because they didn't do things right in the family episode, because they didn't earn a pound. That board game might be something that is supposed to have red guy do something with it, but it didn't happen. Yeah. Anyway. Cool theory."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Considering that your theory came to the conclusion that the DHMIS has to do events in the correct order it would be cool if the next version of DHMIS was a choose your own adventure story like Netflix‚Äôs Bandersnatch
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Game theory and MatPat has entered the decade where they start to promote even more creators and small theories that get a chance to shine. I'm all for it!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I was confused when watching this. I thought it was about the first season. Then I realized I never saw this season. I guess i will see it as a trailer üòÖ. Very entertaining video! Now i will go see the second season!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,It was really cool to see a Collab like this! I hope to see more in the future!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I LOVED this episode, it felt refreshing hearing another mini matpat! ‚ô•"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,You gotta do more with this guy! He‚Äôs great!!!
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"The dynamic between having two hosts back-and-forth exposition where you flow off of each others points, is surprisingly REALLY entertaining, you should definitely experiment more with in the future"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,THE BEST FILM THEORY DUO EVER!! Add him to the film theory club. So he can help you out in further videos
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Mat I just thought of something that you might have overlooked. If you go back to episode 1 of DHMIS getting creative the note pad sounds like the higher up telling the craters to follow what they tell them or they‚Äôll cut the funding.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I would love for Remy to be a reacuring person, maybe even get his own show like The Science! For film theory"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,it feels a bit as if someone's spreading the holiday spirit by getting smaller channels a ton of visibility. Great job.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt bring up when car guy referenced The Counsel when talking about his ‚Äúspecial drink‚Äù that‚Äôs ‚Äúforged far beneath the earth with the last remnants of the ancient ones‚Äù maybe The Counsel are these ancient ones but they‚Äôre no longer in play for whatever reason but they‚Äôre still stuck in a loop caused by them
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"When I looked at the symbols it was kinda clear that one is duck, one red guy and one yellow guy... Here's my reasoning:

- Rotate the symbol of duck by 90 degrees. Now you have something that a child would draw and probs call a duck. At least I reclla drawing such shapes and calling them birds.
- Red guys symbol fits his design. He's a tall man with (for a lack of a better word) spaggethi in his face. And the symbol kinda represents that.
- Yellow guy, as we know from that one episode has batteries inside himself, so he's a robot, which fits the symbol that looks like a robot.

What I find interesting to note is, that the symbols are very simple... They have a child-like look to it... So maybe that's another clue to something?
Either way, given that on the book two of the 3 symbols can/should be rotated clockwise to have a representation of the character, maybe the same should be done with the others?"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Rem's series on dhmis was randomly recommended to me one day while I was getting ready for work, and now here it is being broadcast to millions on the official Film Theory channel? That's wild, and so cool"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,In ep 2 the lamp is the only one who's still alive from the old YouTube series. He also explains what is really going on. When they get it right they get a pound. If the book is telling them how to solve everything to move on. I think with ep 1 they got a step closer to moving on. But the only one who acknowledged something was wrong was duck. Could it possibly be that they need to acknowledge that what is going on around them isn't real but not running away from it? Maybe running towards the problem that It's all in someone's head. Could it possibly be that the old duck survived the looped episodes and never got to be replaced but that would give him time to become self aware. In job's already been through it but not happening the same way it did the first time. Maybe duck started to question the stuff going on around him questioning if it's all real. Becoming Leslie's least favorite because he knows they aren't supposed to be there which is why she killed the old duck in ep 2 using stain the replacement who doesn't know anything about what is happening. I find duck to be stubborn which is what leads me to think that duck is the most self aware when he doesn't get his way. Like family and jobs. He didn't get to do what he wanted to. But that's just what I think ü§î
1,vwbQxMY7yds,seeing matpat bring in smaller creators and giving them credit makes my heart happy
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"First of all, great video! Second, i have been wondering about Lesleys husband aka yellow guys father aka Roy.
In the food episode Roy is seen sitting on top of the TV set like he is an outsider and not actually part of the set.
The help video for the fundraiser is set in a realistic basement. Yellow guy comments that this must be his dads house. It seems again, that Roy is not part of the stylized TV set, but instead comes from a different reality. 
In the dream episode Roy is seen in the ""realistic"" pub and then again in the void with red guy. You have been saying that Roy was inviting red guy to work on the show again, but what if he was inviting red guy to come with him to a different enviroment?
In the family episode Roy is mentioned at the beginning by yellow guy and the other puppets quickly hush him. At the end Roy eats those puppets. He could simply be hungry, but it could also mean, that he wanted to save yellow guy. Tommy and Lily knew him and feared him.  I propose the theory, that Roy is not actually controlled by Lesley, because he is working against her. He is not part of the Story that Lesley is creating. Roy is trying to break the cycle and bring the puppets back to the real world."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I just realised, your theory about Linsey being Yellow Guys mom makes more sense about why Roy doesn't like him that much, because he is not his real son, but more of a copycat."
1,vwbQxMY7yds,I think that Yellow Guy somewhat survives the loops. He has memories of going to see Leslie and one of the characters from Clayhill (the shy younger brother) literally lives in his brain.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"Rem did a great job, ive been keeping up till the last two, need to see them"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Mattpat once again proving that he is worthy of our respect.
1,vwbQxMY7yds,"I love this theory, and that it still has some kind of conection to the old series"
1,vwbQxMY7yds,Hey Mat Pat did you ever notice that in the intro to every episode during the song when the screen pans out from the fridge to the next room in between if you look at it frame by frame you can see a crack in the wall where an eye is looking through connected to a yellow face and an orange nose? It looks a lot like Roy looking in and watching what they are doing without their knowledge.
1,Ftk5IS_Ke90,"Can I just say THANK YOU FOR THE WORD at the beginning of this video. It really hit home. We are all going THROUGH things, so for anyone who is having a tough time, dealing with things, looking for solutions, trying to find a way or have things to SAY.

1,Ftk5IS_Ke90,"I love, and I mean LOVE, my Payback Pony!!! It's so simple to install, I take it off nightly because it's so easy to put it back on the next day! It really has been a game changer for me, because I never used to wear ponytails with my natural hair. But the texture match is so good that I don't have to do anything but wash, condition and pull it back with the smallest amount of gel on the front and nape of my neck to keep it neat. Best purchase I made for my hair in 20222! Thank you for this, Kee!

I'm so sorry about someone stealing your idea! I'm not saying any names because I could be wrong, but I saw a celeb promoting something (subpar to me) similar after receiving mine and I shook my head. I literally thought ""That {insert your own cuss word here, but I used the one beginning with B} probably took Kee's idea!"" ü§£ü§£ü§£ But what God has for you, is for you, so don't worry about it.

1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Hi, check out our artists FAVORITE VIDEOS http://bit.ly/3P8ss10"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This needs apart two! Let's appreciate the time and effort they put into these animations for us.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is one of the best stories MSA has EVER come up with, it brought tears to my eyes- Maggie is so kind-hearted, and Mark just needed someone to lean on. This is so sweet üò≠"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is probably the most beautiful story msa came up with. It had so much emotion in it. And with this art style, it definitely makes the story more beautiful."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Damn. The art in this MSA episode is really good, the animation is amazing, and the story is actually emotional. I like it a whole lot, it‚Äôs pretty realistic and I adore how Mark got some smiles at the end as well as Maggie."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,8:08 let‚Äôs honor her as the first MSA character to actually change her clothes.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,We freaking NEED A PART 2üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ITS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This story genuinely made me cry, it didn‚Äôt have the casual ‚Äúhappy‚Äù ending. This ending was burning with ambitions and reality. And I love it! we need part 2!!!!!!!!!!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"i really enjoyed this, and as much as i would like to see more of their relationship i'm honestly content with the ending as it is now. they didn't end up together (bummer) but i like how their romance wasn't the main focus of their story. instead it showed how both of them helped one another and how mark's character developed throughout the vid. their relationship was cute too, and i like the references towards the end of the video. 

this story is probably one of my new favorites out of all msa videos"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This really needs a part two, the art was so good and the story was so bittersweet I just LOVED it!! üòç‚ú®"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This actually taught me something.....never ever be bugged by the past or future.....always enjoy the present....every second of it...good or bad as you never know when this moment ll come back!‚ô°
Thank you msa‚ô°"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is probably the most beautiful story msa came up with. It had so much emotion in it. And with this art style, it definitely makes the story more beautiful."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Let us appreciate MSA for their great art and how they left us with this love story incomplete just when we were starting to fall for it. We need a part two plss
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"When she said that Mark never left the book alone I instantly said ""maybe it was the death note"""
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Actually loved this artstyle, no introduction, no typical ending, no third person, it was really different from the other stories. Keep it up MSA"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"i didn't watch these in a while, the artist who made this one has always been one of my favourite. Their art and animation improved a lot since the last time i watched a video, keep up !"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,the fact that we found MSA by accident and now we're obsessed
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,i love how its Japanese based with the cherry blossom trees the school uniforms and the houses i love how this channel tells impactful story and scary ones but yet so diverse  love you guys ‚ù§‚ù§üòÅüòÅ
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"this particular video kind of reminded me of an anime series. of how wholesome it turned out, those small details didn't disappoint me.  also, there should be a part 2 !!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,i‚Äôve been crying for half a hour now.. THIS LITERALLY NEEDS A PART 2
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Bro, this video almost made me cry, because it was sad, sweet, understandable, relatable, and so much more. The ending made me want to cry because sitting there was his guitar.‚ù§"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Although this story is perfect this way,  I feel this immense urge to ask for a part two. The way she had his hard heart melting with the warmth of her love  and moulded it into the most  beautiful masterpiece ever. I want to see their  reunion only to know their love only increased as time went by .  Give them a love story please."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Bro at 11:10 to 11:20 tears were dripping down from my cheeküò≠ It hurt to see them get separated but the time and effort that was put into this is amazing!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"HOLY CHEESE I'VE NEVER WANTED A PART TWO SO BAD!!  üò´üò´üò´
That was so cute and sweet! It was like how anime used to be written! Ahhhh please, I want a part two!  üò≠"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is the best animation on this channel. If they had a movie in this animation style, I would definitely watch it."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Can just take the moment to appreciate how much effort and time msa puts into their content for us üòã
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,That was a WHOLE season of a romance/slice of life anime fit into 12 minutes and 12 seconds. This one was wonderfully animated was worth the tears. Best one in this style yet.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is like a romantic anime , the style is so animeish (if that's a word)
Edit : 11:33 I appreciate MSA for their animation especially in this scence"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"We all can agree that we need part two, this one was so beautiful and amazing it even made me cry at the endü•πüíó"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"We realllllyyy need a PART 2!!!
This is literally the most beautiful Japanese inspired Drama I have seenüòçüòçüò≠üò≠üò≠"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,The fact that this story ends where it is the beginning makes it more beautiful.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This is the best story I've ever seen this is giving me anime vibes plus no witches no cheating only love and friendship
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This one is just beautiful. Completely different from the rest but yet became one of the best . We definitely need a PART TWO!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Wow, I swooned. I've been watching MSA only recently... They're in a league of their own. I can't stop watching it. This was so beautiful."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This is a master piece i wish it could have part 2
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,I loved that this ending wasn‚Äôt ‚Äú the typical happy ending‚Äù. They didn‚Äôt end up together and she really moved. But they were both happy at the ending and that‚Äôs what counts.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This is one of the best stories MSA has EVER come up with, it brought tears to my eyes- Maggie is so kind-hearted, and Mark just needed someone to lean on. This is so swe"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Let's be honest, we all found MSA accidentally and now we are obsessed"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This *NEEDS* a part two. MSA videos are getting better and interesting. I literally cried at the end in *EVERY SINGLE VIDEO IN DECEMBER* and once again, I love MSA it makes my day.. And this needs a part two!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"7 in the morning and still watching msa ... haven't sleep all night and just saw the best one yet 
Even tho i don't relate to any of the characters neither did ""He"" but still it touched<3
And the animation was so good hope more videos will be created in this style

And peeleees part 2 :'3
üáßüá©"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Ok, we need a part 2. This was actually amazing, and I really wanna know how it fully ends, and I think I speak for most people. I actually cried at the end. I almost never do that, considering that I'm emotionless, but this really warmed my heart, and I think that maybe I have a chance in life after looking at this. Thank you so much MSA."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This story is so fresh and I love how the animator and the VA tell the story it just super fresh than the usual video! Also I agree that this needs part 2 I'm genuinely invested in this story
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,WE NEED PART 2!!! They HAVE to meet again!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"OMGG- I love this story, i love how its actully real, like alot of ppl go through this and just want someone to be there for them. And the ending just shows a happy ending in some way, he made new friends and stepped out his shell, while she was starting a new life enjoying her time, I do hope u make a part 2!!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"MSA stories keeps getting better 
This one got me really hard üò™
It literally shows our everyday life of bullies. 
BTW this one doesn't need a part 2, it is perfect already ‚ò∫Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,i‚Äôve been crying for half a hour now.. THIS LITERALLY NEEDS A PART 2
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"I think this is the 1st time MSA did an open ended story and a really realistic one. I mean yes it'll be much better if they both reunited at the end but this one is kind of refreshing too, but yeah we want more though ü•πü´∂"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This story kind of feel like im watching an anime movie , with the clothes to the background it really felt like an anime and i love it!! ( ‚ëâ¬Ø Íá¥ ¬Ø‚ëâ )"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Congrats on 15M you great queen!!üíñ
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Tears are rolling down my eyes as I finished the vid. Beautiful.
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"BRUH I LOVE THIS, THIS DEFINITELY NEEDS A PART TWO!!!!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,I'LL PUT THIS ON DISLIKE UNTIL THERE'S A PART TWO THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,this needs a part 2!! badly! the story is so amazing! i almost cried listening to it- but I LOVE THE VID AND JUST EVERYTHING!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,THIS NEEDS PART TWO! THIS IS SO GOOD!‚ù§Ô∏è
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"I‚Äôm surprised Maggie didn‚Äôt introduce herself to us like most narrators do. Also Maggie‚Äôs mom did have a point. Although Maggie had good intentions, she shouldn‚Äôt have looked at mark‚Äôs notebook without permission. It‚Äôs rare when our narrator and the male character don‚Äôt end up together, but it‚Äôs a nice change of pace. I feel like this needs a part 2"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,The story the animation everything was so good and a little different from usual loved it and keep it up
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"MSA need to make this an Anime. 

This episode is beatiful.

I dont feel like there is supposed to be a Part 2 when you pay attention on how the episode ends."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,We NEED PART 2 this is the most beautiful thing I've wtached üò≠üò≠üò≠ i cried while watching this near the end üò≠üò≠üò≠ MSA u have done it again üíúüíú love ur work‚ú®‚ú®üíúüíú
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"It's the most beautiful story I have ever heard ‚ù§
And I wish they will meet again soon"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,This melted my heart! Sometimes bullies bully people to reflect how they feel. It shouldn't be that way. Sometimes only a few of us can see through their mask...(We NEED a part two!!)
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"This story was different, there was no drama or gossip only sadness and love and they didn't end up together but instead she left him. I think it's better that we don't have a part two"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,WE NEED A PART TWO üò≠
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,OK I‚ÄôM ACTAULLY CRYING RIGHT NOW THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT SO SAD PLEASE WE NEED A PART 2 üò≠ ‚ù§

1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,WE NEED A PART 2!!!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"By far, this is one of my favorite stories. As everyone always says, this art style never disappoints. But today was different. This story actually had a moral that was really special. It was a nice reminder to cherish what I have. Also the mc was very cute! Anyways thanks msa for filling  people‚Äôs day with this beautiful masterpiece today  üíó"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,Who would guess we will see Diluc in MSA style but anyway we need a freaking part 2 of this masterpiece
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,I balled my eyes out while watching this. This cannot be the end üòø
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,NEEDS A PART 2üéâ

I love your work, it motivates me. Hope you have an awesome journey to reach high....and u will..maybe u have already..
Still, Thank you for your hard work. It must feels awesome when your hardwork motivates someone. I hope to get that to.

1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"I loved it but I wished that they would be together in the end,like seeing each other as a coincidence after many years and looking at each other in the eye and smiling then it would be the perfect ending."
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"One of the most important lessons of life was demonstrated in this video it‚Äôs to ‚Äúnever judge a book by its cover‚Äù Mark was a sweet guy who was insecure because of his family but Maggie unlocked his sweet and kind hearted side ‚ù§Ô∏è
Edit: thanks so much for 500 likes :)"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,WE NEED PART TWO!!üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"Usually every story from this channel have a happy ending, but this one ends differently, it was a sad story I have to admit that it was good tho"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,I need a part 2 of this!!!üò≠‚ù§
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,WE NEED A PT 2 ASAP !!
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,We need a part 2!!!

1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"When you watch 1 video, you just want to keep watching. Keep up the good work MSA!!"
1,y2RXkBZpgBQ,"I'm not a wizard or anything, but I'm pretty sure some is going to say: ""Lets appreciate the time and effort they put into these animations for us."""
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Tomorrow at midnight boys.... get'r done! https://cleetusmcfarland.com/store
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Jackstand needs his own segment where he tests cars and gives his feedback. That's his talent.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Cleet: Don't miss a shift.
Jackstand: I can't.

ü§£ü§£ü§£"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Ole Jackstand is underrated. He needs more time on camera. I hope cleeter appreciates him like he should!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I'm not usually a Ford guy, but the F-1 Smokeems has really stole my heart! From the stance to the way she sounds! I love it!!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,ü§ûüèª crossing my fingers man! That little pickup is something else boy! Good luck everyone who‚Äôs entered
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Can we just take a second and appreciate how good Bradenton Motorsports Park is looking... Well done guys.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,That Sneak-O Boost is incredible! George out there looking fly too üëåüèº
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,So let's look at this logically. They race crown vics that are tough as nails. The most reliable car in the fleet that gets absolutely beat on is neighbor now an f150 with a stock engine and a blower puts the beat down on the c7 and cleetus drives a raptor for his daily  .not bad for an ls channel lmfao. Ford power baby.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Georgie sure loves the drag strip. Gets all dresses up to go
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,im 100% a chevy guy for life but i think its time to break the internet with a coyote swapped C7
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,It's kinda insane not only how fast that truck is but how consistent it is
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I can‚Äôt wait to see who wins the truck!!! That is going to be a day to remember for someone!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Coyote F150 is the GOAT of daily drivers. I‚Äôve had 2 now over 5 years and they have been my favorite trucks. I had a Tahoe and Sierra before the Fords, and still own a Trans Am and a Silverado dually so no bias here. They‚Äôre just great trucks‚Ä¶ mine needs a whipple"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,That F150 pulling! 5.0 Coyote is a legendüî•üî•
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Honestly didn't care who won just cool to see cleetus is so impressed with the F150.  (Appears to be genuine too)
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,A perfect 139 mph on every pass. That's the most remarkable part of this whole thing.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"As a brit, that's only ever drove manual. I don't get how the straight back motion from 1st to 2nd can be missed. Definite practice needed there üòÖ"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I really hope y‚Äôall can find an AWD one to keep!! That would be an awesome build.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"""I'm a believer in the coyote""

I loved that. Don't get me wrong I like LS but I'm a coyote guy and it's just an amazing engine! ‚ú®Ô∏è ü•∞üí™"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"AMAZING!!!  I had the Corvette by a car length or so every time, even figuring the freaky fast shifting F150.  Figured more power, WAY better aero, WAY less weight for the Vette.  I've never been much of a Ford guy but man they've come A LONG way since the 90's/00's when Chevy was shitting all over them in the V8 wars."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Whipple owes Cleetus a royalty check for all the supercharger sales this truck has inspired üòÇ
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,them 10sp trans really pair well w the gen 3 yotes honestly one of the best combos to ever been produced
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"it was coming on hard at the end, hence the 10mph difference. Cleetus is spinning a lot"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,These were damn good races boys!! That f-150 is an absolute beast!! I love the c7 as well. Whoever wins the f150 is going to have a great time and will be very happy with it!!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,George looks AWESOME! No explanation on why? He just felt like being a CEO today?
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Can we talk about how aggressive and sick that 10R80 is shifting?! Badass truck!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Man this F150 is the perfect drag and drive 'truck' I think. Impressive in all areas.
Too bad I live in Australia and cant win it but fuck I'll be happy as a pig in shit for the person that wins it.
Cant wait to move to Florida and get to catch a live Cleetus show"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I think you should reevaluate the gear ratios in the trans on the c7 , because of how much power that's making it should pull better through the midrange  , and the shifts from the 10 speed sound pretty quick"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,That cab POV of that last race was SICK!!!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"That 10 speed is something else , it's like Fast n Furious with amount of gear changes you hear .... Good luck who ever wins it üëç"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Had a ton of fun thanks again for having me out with my Hellcat RAM 1500! üí™
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I‚Äôd appreciate y‚Äôall not ragging out my new truck too much before I take delivery. üòÇ If only!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Ford did a fantastic job with the coyote platform! I have a driveway full of GMs but I will always show respect to solid performers. Well done ford!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I'm a die-hard, long-time Ford guy, but I never paid too much attention to the Coyote. I knew they were great engines, but DAMN. ü§Ø"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I've owned a 67 ' Mustang with a 289 500cfm carb and 4 speed toploader transmission...a 71 GTO Judge  with a 400 and 650 Holley carb on a hi-rise intake and 3 speed manual Transmission  and 72' Chevelle SS 396 and I loved all of them . All three have great stories to tell so as long as it's American made it's alright with me . No MOPARS but they made several badass cars too !  I miss those cars so bad .  PK
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"James: ""you miss a gear""
Cleet: ""nah""
James: immediately pulls helmet off to talk smack. 
Priceless üòÇüòÇ"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I could see cleeters right foot punching a hole in the floorboard trying to catch the f150 on the last pass üòÇ dude was almost Flintstoning it
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Damn! you guys have been putting out some great content the last weeks, LOVE IT !!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"let‚Äôs be real here lol 
yes, the truck is fast. really fast and i‚Äôm impressed myself because i hear the stock bottom end coyotes are tough but i didn‚Äôt know how tough. this is a mechanical art in my opinion lol 
the corvette is fast but look at the mods done to it compared. the lt1 would explode under that kind of power with a stock bottom end.
truck wins regardless"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,This freakin' truck is insane! I can't wait for it to be in my driveway. LOL.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Man the shifts of that 10speed look savage.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Seeing that f150 race the Silverado let‚Äôs you know how good that 10spd is, every shift was bumping him forward"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Dang Cleet, you're being hard on my new truck.  You just leave that tune up right where it is thank you!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Could you guys imagine Ruby with a semi-built 10 speed? Would be utterly unstoppable. Pretty sure there's a few companies that make bellhousing adapters to make it fit on the LS platform.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Chevy guys gotta swallow your pride and give props to the coyote remarkably great engine
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Cleet is on fire lately! We are blessed with all the content!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,What a hot rod!!!! Keep on keepin on well love supporting you guys. Entertainment at its finest.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Cleet, you are truly living the dream and seem to be a really awesome dude.  Happy for all your success, you deserve it, and wishing you much more."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Great content!  It would have been nice to see JUST one race from a dig.


But, I think we all know how that would have turned out.ü§£
I just don‚Äôt buy the talk about hurting the transmission when you beat on the Marauder often and claimed it was to ensure the vehicle was tested and ready for any abuse the winner could throw at it.  The transmission in the truck was replaced with one that should live behind that power plant for a while.  Just seems like Cleet didn‚Äôt wanna see the Corvette get taken to Gapplebee‚Äôs.  LOL!

Anyway, that‚Äôs one incredible truck!  Jackstand really nails the timeslip analysis too!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Crazy that the c7 has 127 cubes and all that work on the engine and transmission and can still only squeeze by by a fender
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I think Jackstands most underrated quality is his steady hands behind the camera!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"It's easy to see why he is switching Neighbor to the Coyote engine this time around.  Just a much more common and a proven platform.  I'm actually interested to see how well it handles the abuse compared to the old 5.4 GT500 design engine.  The coolest thing is how well they perform with the amount of upgrades compared to other engines out there.
Great showing by the truck!   Power to weight I knew the Corvette could walk it down in a long race.  But, the 5.0 sure did prove its legendary name again in this race."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Keep in mind‚Ä¶that‚Äôs only 302 CI doing all that work üòâ Makes it that much more impressive!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Would of loved to see you go against a second gen ford lightning. I've got one but no longer live in FL. Would of been cool to show old vs. new mines mostly stock just a few upgrades. Made 380hp and 462ft. lbs. at the tires at Steve Morris's shop. But now I'm seriously jealous seeing that truck and hope I win but if I don't I'm going to buy one with four wheel drive.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I hope whomever wins the truck has some driving skills because I guarantee they will try to be like Cleetus when they jump in the truck.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I've said it before, the Coyote Gen3 is no joke.  450+ HP/Tq stock out the box, warrantied in the Mustang GT, NA, 4 cam sensors, big wheel crank sensor, all the knowhow of Ford put into that engine.  Adding a whipple just means adding another <edited out, happy? :p> more HP to the thing as is normal.  Stupid crazy awesome motors.  Neighbor wants one and you need to get it for him."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"This f150 is insane. It's crazy every single pass how consistent it was, someone is going to be lucky to own this! (hoping it's meüòÇ)"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Cleetus is gonna blow up the F-150 market as long as the clowns know what they are looking forüòÇüòÇ
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Glad to see Boosted on the channel finally! Hope yall get together more
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"You know Cleetus is gonna build the exact same truck after the give away
i know i would, ""SHEESH""!!üòèüòè"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I""d love to see what that thing will do in mile run"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Mr. Mitchell, picture this! You, James, George, and one other person's, take four nice crown vics and each of you pick a power adder with tires. IE each one picks between  a procharger, super charger, screw blower with a hat,  and a turbo all similar CFM intake and test, compare for a few videos and selvage the power adder after the fact. Would be a good series! If the money to videos work, I'd like to see the scientists solve the best controlled power adder!! May ripper and your family be blessed"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,This is sick!  Now lets talk about that 3rd Gen 4Runner hanging out back there!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,It's going to be sad to see the f150 leave I think you need to get another one and see how far you can push it
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Love that these guys are slowly turning into Ford guys üòÇ. But honestly glad to see you‚Äôre enjoying the Coyote power plant, they‚Äôre no joke"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Ford/GM did a thing with those 10-speeds it‚Äôs INSANE the way it goes through gears
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Been considering selling my 2018 supercharged 2SS after getting my doors blown off by a 2021 twin turbo f150 single cab like a month ago üòÇ those trucks are so sexy, consistent, and they can handle the power guy has been abusing his twin turbo f150 for a year now on stock Motor/trans and has never had a problem and he was smoking cars left and right"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Imagine if you get rid off all the useless weight on that f150.. i think there is easy 8s truck and still it could be daily drived. Amazing truck and mostly the engine and gearbox.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,If Cleetus does get a better version of the giveaway truck for himself my life will never be complete. That thing still amazes me!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,These guys are a content MACHINE!! How is a new dad still producing all this content?!?
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I'm not a fan of prochargers they feel wicked but they just done seem to pull as hard as others
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Put that Procharger on the 'Yote, now - w/ all them gears, it'll stay in high revs & boost and stomp that 'Vette out!!  :)"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Cleetus & the boys are 100% getting their use out of this truck while they have it lmao.
Never seen a give away vehicle drove & raced so much lol.

Shes a ripper!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Ford can be justifiably proud of that little coyote, it's a hell of an engine in a darn nice truck."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,the f-150 sounds like its from fast and furious with its unlimited gear changes
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Got to be honest... I love that truck. Hopefully after the giveaway you can build a replica one for the channel. It is so sick
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,As a Chevy guy sadly my current favorite single cab is the newer body f150s at this point I‚Äôd be happy to see cleet do a single cab build
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,The Cleet crew most definitely needs one of those F150s for their fleet!!! üò≥
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,If Cleetus doesn‚Äôt go and buy an F150 to keep in the fleet I‚Äôm going to be super disappointed! This thing is insane we all love it üòç
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I freaking love seeing these die hard chevy guys showing the coyote the appreciation they deserve! Both cleet and Jackstand will have a coyote powered vehicle before too long!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Would've loved to see the C7 start on 2nd and see what difference it made
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Would love to see a coyote or voodoo in neighbor. And then the Godzilla mustang build with a 10 speed or another f150 as a modern day lighting with a turbo
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Cleetus hear me out.
Now just imagine that engine in a mustang vs your vette üòÅ"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Is it the engine or the transmission? Would love to see the 10 speed behind some other power plants.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Cleetus in the c7 shouting at the f150 pulling away reminded me of ja rule in 2 fast 2 furious.. ""NOOO.. MONICA!"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Has to be some of the best content yet bud üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Coyote is king üëë but keep it on the low cleet we don‚Äôt need the price doubling from hype üòÇ remember the 2jz gte back in 2016 was under 3k then after the hype it‚Äôs 10k +
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"bone-stock (bolt-on supercharger) never change, cleetus. never change! üòÑ"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"The F150 is incredible, any commercial vehicle which can hold it's own against a 1000hp car is mighty impressive üëç"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"10,000 üëç‚Äôs in an hour. Man our boy Cleet is killin it!!"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I gotta say when it came to the pickup truck races you totally had a good half a truck length for both the dodge and the Chevy at the start.
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"We gotta remember guys;

This is essentially a built car shaped like an Arrow VS a basically stock truck shaped like a Brick"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,The c7 in car camera sounds insane. Just sounds like a strong power plant engine!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Want more Porsche content.
Looking forward to seeing a hybrid turbo setup with E85.Then challenge Kyles nonsense Honda again.üòé"
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,I'd be curious as to the shift points on the 10 speed.  Did it seem like the  8 and 9 shifts were a tad bit early?
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"I have a 2018 RCSB 5.0 F150 too and watching the videos you guys have done on this makes me so giddy, I wanted to boost it at some point badly before seeing this unit but now I want to eeeevvvvveeeennnn more haha."
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Make George a race suit that looks like the suit he's wearing!
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,Glad to see that some chevy enthusiasts appreciating a Ford powered monster and not trashing on it
1,bKAYnpb8f_A,"Those ford v8's are truly impressive, 800+ horsepower to the wheels through a TC auto box on a stock engine that's rated at 400bhp from factory. wow."

1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,Sitting here in Central PA  by the fireplace getting some happy added to my day! Do you use a filter or are you blessed with that complexion? ‚ù§ Update on addition please üòè
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"An early comment here....Kim, isn't the toy area in Kohls so random? ALSO, stuff you think they should absolutely have they don't. Like good receiving blankets, just so much more. I shopped for my new grandbaby there a few weeks ago and they had nothing for him, NOTHING! NB clothing, socks etc...nada! 
Ok, back to the vid...lol"
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"Hi everyone!

1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,Good morning!  Always happy to see your videos!  You are doing a great job. You are a good Momma. God bless!ü§ó
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"I use to struggle with stocking stuffers too, always trying to create the perfect pinterest worthy stocking. I finally decided to stop torturing myself, and started doing what my parents and their parents did.  An orange and an apple, a little Christmas candy. Chapstick, lip gloss, lotion, or body spray. And every year I get each kid a new Christmas mug with cocoa packs, candy canes, and a little baggie of marshmallows. Simple, traditional, and far more wallet friendly!"
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,U are cute mama n watching your video is very enjoyable. Cleaning the house is never ending bcos I myself is homemaker. Thanks for sharing.
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,Thanks as always.  Price of sending cards is quite expensive.   I send them to my older relatives.
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,You and Jessica Braun are my favs‚ù§Ô∏è
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,All those samples will be fun for your two oldest.

1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"Xmas cards are a dying art. 40 years ago I sent out at least 50 cards and now I send 10. It gets less every year. Of course stuff happens. People move, people pass away."

1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,You are unstoppable!!!!
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,I have kept probably a hundred Christmas cards people sent me.  I used to use them as decor at work.
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"You should use the $10 off $30 to buy two shampoos to go with the conditioners

Also, it would look really good if you sanded down and stained the kitchen table the same as your coffee table and end tables. It would also look more cohesive. Just an idea ‚ù§"
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"So true about getting a bit crazy sometimes , It‚Äôs the same for me with music and I can‚Äôt sing a note but who‚Äôs going to hear anyway.I‚Äôm 64 and yes I dance while doing the dishes."
1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,Good Morning love. Have a blessed day!

1,1L4PRp3Cwm4,"I don‚Äôt like to shop at kohl‚Äôs at all. Every store has different rules.  I paid cash at both stores- One store gave me kohl‚Äôs cash and the listed sale prices. The other refused to give me the sale price or kohl‚Äôs cash because I wouldn‚Äôt use their credit card.  They can keep everything, I don‚Äôt care how much I needed the items."

1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Goggins is funny without trying because he is so real it‚Äôs comedic and refreshing
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I appreciate the fact that he takes life seriously. As I‚Äôm fighting cancer right now I know‚Äîevery moment counts. And you have nothing without your health. Absolutely nothing. And so many diseases and mental afflictions are preventable with dedication and living life with intention. 

That being said‚Äîthis particular message and mentality (no rest, no play, no vacation) is just as pathologically American and unhealthy. 

The ability to shift gears between motivation, forward center of mass, drive and reprieve, solitude, embracing the sensations of being present in the outdoors and enjoying the gifted consciousness that we have as human beings (when we could have been bacteria, a rodent, a cow, a tree) is ALSO a skill worth developing.

Balance is key. And when you‚Äôre in a position like mine‚Äîwhich you all will be at some point. You will remember those solitary moments‚Äîthe accomplishments, yes‚Äîbut also the quality of your relationships, and the quality of your moments. All of them."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Motivation is present just for a brief time, mostly when you start something and you are so happy that you started, because you are thinking of the results you will achieve in the end. But then, in the following days, when it becomes a routine, motivation is the first thing that abandons you, and you stand there all alone and disappointed, thinking ""do I even want this anymore?"". That's why discipline beats everything else, if you don't depend yourself on discipline, you'll never finish anything."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I love Goggins because of that. He's truthful and he follows through with his own advice. He's flawed, and he's open about it. His vulnerability coupled with his mental perseverance makes him an extraordinary human. He turned physical effort into a mental one, and that completely changes the situation.
Starting to think that way helped me tremendously, and many others."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Goggin‚Äôs tenacity is contagious.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"David Goggins, you have discovered the secret of the great yogis of India without knowing (or maybe you do).  That facing suffering without fear of suffering leads to the overcoming of suffering until it eventually bends to your will.  You are an amazing human being.  Thank you for your strength."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,So damn happy to see Goggins back on JRE. Love this guy. Stay hard.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"the irony is that Goggins is motivating for people, but motivation is temporary and it's a dangling carrot to get you moving. It's about getting passed that."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Leads by example , speaks honestly from experience , thank you sir ."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Just listening to Goggins gives you motivation.

God bless him. Will be ordering his 2nd book soon."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"David Goggins motivates me! He keeps me going for runs, even when it feels like my knee is going to shatter into a million pieces!"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"LOL.. let goggins be goggins... 99% of people that try his method, hurt themselves, burnout and quit within a month or two.  Better to take it slow and stay consistent."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I‚Äôve probably watched the ‚Äúprocrastination statement‚Äù a thousand timesüòÇ, i thought i only had such moments. But yeah in 13 days I complete a year of working out consistently. Life‚Äôs good"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Love Goggins. His autobiography is insane
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Just when I think I've had enough Goggins for a while, he pulls me back in!"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Recently I've been feeling burned out. Last time I took a break from the gym was July 24th of this year because I got COVID. Not sure if I'm just being a bitch but this podcast will most definitely help me break through this plateau if you will. Stay hard!
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I followed a grueling 2 a days workout routine for 8 months. Running 6 miles in the morning and lifting weights at night. Running a 20-35 mile run on Sunday. The reality of following a Goggins like routine is it pretty much consumes your entire life. Not to mention you're always sore and in pain.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Couldn‚Äôt live my life like Goggins. Respect it. But I couldn‚Äôt Live my life like that
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,God I love Goggins. God bless that man
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Let's be realistic here people. Hard work, dedication, and discipline will take you far in life, but I believe it's important to take time to stop and smell the roses. Otherwise you become an overbearing, obsessed workaholic who takes shit way too seriously. There must be a balance between work and play."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Well, motivation lives a short life. Habit will get you through rough days."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This man is an icon
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I love this man I'm about to hit the gym as we speak, stay hard!!!!"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Motivation is the teetering faith in the prospect of finding purpose. I don't like to admit my mind is black, but it seems to be that way. In the prolonged absence of purpose, at some point you have to accept the daily struggle and reward as the purpose itself. After awhile, it begins to make sense why the ultimate purpose must be the journey. I can't live for nothing forever. I've been trying to grasp that concept more to reprogram my thought patterns away from the nihilistic void."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,You are a prisoner of your own success. Salute to you.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Such a shame YouTube doesn't allow the Full Episodes any more from Joe Rogan.  Those were epic days back then.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"At the :57 mark, Joe‚Äôs question and David‚Äôs answer are the REALEST question/answer ever! Perfect question that we ALL wanted to know, and an answer that I never would‚Äôve guessed he‚Äôd respond with. üî•üî•üî•"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"What he means is his willpower. He has the willpower to do the hard things and not need a break/vacation because he doesn't use up his mental capacity throughout the day thinking about things he can't control or change. Those ""mental aid stations"" are times where he can clear his mind reserving his willpower so that when it's time to do hard things, he doesn't let anything in his mind deter him. Life, worries, fears, doubts, ect."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,He's a good dude and a great source of motivation but he goes overboard on being hardcore 24/7.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This man tell us he‚Äôs like us but he has a gift he‚Äôs a special guy we can get our full potential  but he‚Äôs mind is on something else because he has something in him and it‚Äôs coming from  heart
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This man is a legend. My fam had to move to Buffalo from NYC due to finance and he‚Äôs literally from Buffalo so it‚Äôs giving me good fuel üî• . Thank you Mr. Goggins!
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,When Goggins needs to decompress he dials it back to 1 Ultramarathon a day
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This guy is f****** awesome could listen to any videos he does should definitely have his own TV show as well as podcast if he doesn't more people should listen to this
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,David Goggins is the greatest human being on planet earth. I‚Äôm completely serious too. STAY HARD.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Something tells me Goggins never fell for the timeshare trap.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Goggins, the only REAL life coach/motivational speaker in the world."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Discipline always overcomes motivation
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"""Do you go on vacations?""

""Sure, I call them showers.""

That's savage"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"""Perform without purpose"" when we feel unmotivated üî•ü§ûüèª"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Every time i say im not going to work out, i pretend goggins is yelling at me to get after it lol"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"‚ÄúLiver king‚Äôs a fraud‚Äù - We Knew

‚ÄúGoggins is really a character‚Äù - we fighting üëäüèΩ

Edit: not all hero‚Äôs are fake"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This man is something else a different kind of beast
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Motivation doesn‚Äôt last everyday
Neither Does Showering or Eating
That‚Äôs why I recommend it Daily. 
Discipline is Just a fancy term for being Motivated Every day."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Love Goggins.....but.  
How can anyone stand to listen to a repeat over and over, for most of 3 hours about how great he is?"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,GOGGINS needs to do standup comedy
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,At some point you have to admit he ain‚Äôt got it all üòÇ
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Lol We love you Tommy. Stay strong.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,That mini vacation comment was üî•üî•
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"He seems happy with how he's living, he's certainly mentally adaptable. Not me man."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"See, this Goggins guy might have success in his mind and maybe he enjoys/gets something out of this level of obsession, but I can be 80-90% as successful, fit, etc...and still live a much more balanced life. He seems cultish to me. I know he's wildly popular, and I like a lot of what he says...but he's incredibly extreme."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,What if he put all this dedication into something that he actually enjoyed?
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Rogan is hilarious...in his head he thinks he's a ""comedian"", no he's a host, just a host, and been a host a long time, there's zero creativity he brings to the picture lol"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Making decisions for your life based on what other people need or want is dangerous AF. Just saying
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I just love Goggins üòÉ
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I like and respect goggins. But I think this obsessional approach doesn't suit everyone.  There's a lot to be said for a balanced life of chill and exercise.  Why not stay reasonably hard?
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,He is Legend!
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"He is so simple in his approach that he is almost profound. lol ""aid stations""  --awesome--"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Thank you David Goggins.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Hey goggins do u take vacations?
Goggins: Yeah, I take showers and drive my car"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Goggins sounded more depressed this podcast I think
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Honestly I get the motivation I get the crazy accomplishments but dude is too hardcore. Fuck all that we are here for a limited time on earth I‚Äôm going to enjoy my life and experience this world and all it holds. I want to be healthy and live a long life but you can‚Äôt tell me this dudes body is going to feel amazing at 70. But hey that‚Äôs his life to each there own.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This guy is good and all but he still doesn‚Äôt get it. Being a warrior or mr alpha and all whatever is pointless cuz it doesn‚Äôt matter anyways. We all die one day
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,David Goggins is the Final Boss for Saitama (One Punch Man)
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Id love to armwrestle David Goggins
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Running for no reason is the most pointless thing to do
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"The life goal, the end: is to be striving; walk the ""straight path"" and strive ""for the cause of God""."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I llove Goggins , looking forward to him moving forward past physical work workout"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Ppl go try different things for fun, like running for fun, gym for fun etc..if you doing something for fun, you'll never get better at it. That's why it's called workout, not fun-out...its work...work isn't fun. You wanna have fun, go to a fairground or mall."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,It‚Äôs a strange time that we live in that the extreme and the insane are looked upon for guidance of how to live your life.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Performance without purpose. Thanks for this one !
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, David. U keep on trucking, bcs that‚Äôs why I keep on smashing through my obstacles. üí™"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Some people take vacations to reset, I take them because I enjoy vacations, period."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,This is the perfect description of exercise bulimia and anorexia
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I'm way tougher than goggins - I never take a shower
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"What does this guy do other than go running and workout? I can‚Äôt figure it out, I‚Äôm seeing his name everywhere"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Peterson: clean your room

Goggins: Organize your f*cking garage"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"This dudes headstone will read. ‚Äú work work work, no fun, dead ‚Äú"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I find great solace in my suffering. Lifting is like medicine for my soul.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I feel like God may use DG over JP. Just feels more genuine, less involved in politics and therefore less prone to be a false prophet."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I don‚Äôt understand, isn‚Äôt this guy‚Äôs entire life a vacation? He gets paid to run and go to the gym. That‚Äôs literally a vacation for everyone else in the world."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Want to go on vacation?
Does it suck? 
No
No"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,The hardest man alive.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,So many fakes out there ripping people off. And they all click up to create a tsunami of bullshit. That‚Äôs why I love this dude
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"I kind of don‚Äôt want to hit the gym right now at 12:41AM, but I‚Äôm going because I‚Äôll feel better once I start lifting and no one else will be there in my way."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Goggins is painful. Needs to get over himself.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Amen my man, that‚Äôs the right question to ask when you wake up, ‚Äúdo I wanna be a btch today?"
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,What a god send to show humanity to be better.
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Groggins is so Tense his nostrils won't relax lol..Love the motivation!!

1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Lol goggins Is so full of it
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Performing w/o purpose is actually very cleansing for th brain.  All the meanings & purposes to things just creates clutter in th brain.  (How Goggins describes it is similar to how monks work their days.)
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Imagine looking back on your life knowing you never took time to have fun and enjoy life? ......
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"My alarm clock: ""Do you want to be a bitch today?""

Me: Hits snooze button."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Goggins voice sounds stressed, like he is dying from exhaustion."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,Never going on vacations would blow tbh
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,I'm ready to pay David Goggins 1M to Drill me!
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"This seems so silly and over the top to me. Just exercise regularly to keep in decent shape and enjoy life whenever you can, be it vacation, family time or something more exciting."
1,cjvCP6XVOPk,"Worst thing is to go on a bad vacation‚Ä¶.. when you run your own business, even if someone is handling it for you. Everything still gets backed up and fucked up. Js"

1,InPZjowTnyo,"So happy you're back Kevin!  IMO, that ending sums it up nicely!  It's an admirable thing to hold out some kind of hope that this brood of vipers will change...‚ÄúI tell you,‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúif they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.‚Äù  But after over a hundred years of their insidious, arrogant and self-justified behavior, I don't see it happening."
1,InPZjowTnyo,"A new one. A superb Christmas gift! You have great talent, insight. Great production values."
1,InPZjowTnyo,Wonderful job!  On point on every topic.  If you don‚Äôt mind sharing.  How many hours or days did I it take to create this video?
1,InPZjowTnyo,"I've thought about you a lot lately. I've really missed your videos. I'm so happy you're back!!!
You're an important part of our community."

1,InPZjowTnyo,"Thank you Mr Mcfree! My first year out since I was 15!  You do make a difference!! Splaine it to me!  I so like the scene that reflects ‚Äòthe the shining‚Äô. I refused to go out on Christmas Day ministry, even when I was in.  ‚ÄòI wanna wish you all an apostate xmas!!‚Äô For all out there, there is life after this! Seasons greetings x"

1,InPZjowTnyo,"I don't know why this popped up in my recommendations, but I'm glad it did. Great work. 
The JW's destroyed my brother in law's life, he was troubled vulnerable kid, they sucked him in and poisoned his mind, turned him against family, he'll never get over the mental damage. He lives on the street now. I'm angry when I think about it."
1,InPZjowTnyo,OMG OMG OMG ... Sooo much to take in. Amazing. Thank you sooo much for this. Re-watch time after time.
1,InPZjowTnyo,"When i heard the elder said to his son 'while you live under my roof, you must submit to my rules..', i had a flashback of my own experience with my mother, those were the exact same words my mother said to me when I chose not to be a JW anymore...that must be a line JW were taught to say to coerced their children to submission..."

1,InPZjowTnyo,I was kicked out of the house at age 16 because I stopped going to meetings. She has shunned me for over 40 years now. I don't even know where she lives.
1,InPZjowTnyo,"Great video, but I was expecting more exposure of the whole ‚Äònot celebrating Christmas‚Äô thing. Some JWs are so intent on not celebrating Xmas that they make it an anti celebration. And the refusal to join in school activities related to Xmas is such torture to children who  have to watch other children enjoying glitter and glue."
1,InPZjowTnyo,In life I was a governing body member. Oh my goodness. That is just so funny that is just so so funny.
1,InPZjowTnyo,Lovely to see you're back.
1,InPZjowTnyo,I'm at a 11 seconds the teachings at the hall are frightening. I laughed so hard I almost stepped on my little dog . Just bursted out laughing . I had to pause it to hear the rest. I'm about to resume. I wasn't expecting it. Lmfao ü§£

1,YxqdJtXNQkw,its a great video just because im in it
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"nie no widaƒá progres z ka≈ºdym kolejnym filmem, lecisz dalej!"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,its just insane how you were able to get  such a project going and then even finishing it. really really good vid im happy that i can be a part of your comunity keep up the great work <3
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Impressive. The jokes were super fitting and the sheer amount of work done. Also the underground themes of terraria was super fitting.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"my guild was originally gonna do something like this but it didn‚Äôt end up happening. I was so sad when I heard the concept wasn‚Äôt being done so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing it now
Get to see what I never got a chance to"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Bro I was waiting to see this since the first day the crystal hollows came out and this blew my expectations nice job
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"This was really fun to be in, sadly we didn‚Äôt finish the entire lobby, the spooky really carried tho lowkey"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Alternate title: TimeDeo joined my crystal hollows lobby (gone wrong)
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Frediii is for sure gonna be a big hypixel youtuber in a few months
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,When they don‚Äôt give you the ruby spot.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Literally everyone expected this to be clickbait and he actually did it mad respect and also bro really freed bal from his spawning place LMAO
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"I‚Äôve been wondering ever since I saw the crystal hollows if you could mine it out, I can‚Äôt wait to watch this"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"Its the power of teamwork. Thats why if life gives you lemonades, blow up crystal hollows"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,damm now i regret leaving the server right before you guys were starting. i couldve been a part of it
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Lmao I have tried to solo this and managed to get almost 25% of the jungle solo (using jungle pick for profit ofc)
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Oh my god ive been wanting to see this happen ever since i got into the crystal hollows thank you
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,awesome video! amazing idea and great editing as well.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"Amazing work, I'm afraid that this lobby is now closed, I really want to see it myself! - Jestem Polakiem jakby co ;)"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Ever since I heard you could perms destroy blocks in crystal hollows I wondered if you could do this
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"How it feels when you trying to find needed structure, but cant:"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,great editing! keep up the good work
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,POV: You are trying to find fairy grotto.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,i had the same idea but i could only mine the whole y124 of the precursor area with my pickaxe lol
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Pov: you don't want to pay for armadillo mining coords
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Bro finally recorded all of his mining off camera we now know what it looks like
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,When someone from Ohio says ‚ÄúI did some off camera mining‚Äù:
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,quality content from a quality youtuber
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"Good vid. I wanted to make this idea at some point, but, alas, I‚Äôm not a SBYT so it kinda swam away. Glad to see someone else actually do it."
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,It looks to be more greiffed than 2b2t spawn.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,this is the content the people need
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"Bro I stop playing Skyblock for 5 days and this happens, man I love the community"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,I have thought of this before never had people willing to do it nice vid tho
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,I don't feel complete without the old outro sequence
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,I remember trapping bal like 3 months ago but this is a whole new level
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,i should have joined in on the bombing part we would have definitely completed it but i was lacking that day
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,FINALY SOMEONE DID THE IDEA I HAVE HAD SINCE THE CH RELEASED LES GOOOOOOOO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,I knew someone was going to do this eventually lol
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"I always wanted to do that, sad that I couldn't be a part of this"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"wow my man, you really needed that powder didn't you?"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"That intro is amazing, which program did u use?"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Nucleus runs gunna take 30 seconds
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Doing crystal runs should be so easy there xd
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Fun fact: a good way to get ice in skyblock is frost walker boots in the hot springs.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Super fun to be apart of :)
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,So crystal hollows are now terraria caves ??
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,now build a castle inside the crystal hollows
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,man it would be a shame if this guy exposed himself for cheating
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Epic event loved it
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,‚Äúi invited the best -minors- miners‚Äù
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Easiest structures ever
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"I had thoughts about doing this, I just didn‚Äôt have the time or enough people to do it"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Maybe spending 5 hours to 'set up' a lobby was worth it....
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Damn thats impressive
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,awesome video man keep it up
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,This was absolutely worthy
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Best YouTuber right now! ‚ù§
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"""Biggest place""
Crimson isle:"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,hey guys in todays video we will be ENTIRELY REMOVING THE CRYSTAL HOLLOWS FROM HYPIXEL SKYBLOCK
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,It literally looks like a chunk error
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Epic video man‚Äôs üëå
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,lmfao just the other day i was thinking someone should do this
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,I waited for someone to do this for 2 months THX
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,How did the lobby not die?üò≠
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Skyblock is just a literal prison server ;-;.
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"random non joins for the first time: yo wtf, people said this was cool not a void"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Crystal Holliws in Ohio üíÄ
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,well i was wondering wtf happened to bob omb prices but now i got the answer
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"I invited the best ‚Äúminors‚Äù 

Wtf lol"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,amazing video! wonder whats next lol
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,"0:06 ""Its over 60m blocks""
0:40 ""Lobbies close after 5 hours""
1:17 - ""its been about 25 minutes and we already made a lot of progress"",""we destroyed about 1 million blocks"", ""going at this pace it will be done in no time""

*maths* 
25mins = 1m blocks
1 min = 1mil/25 = 40k blocks per minute
60m/40k = 1500 minutes at this rate
1500min / 60 = 25 hours

Conclusion: It is not a lot of progress, the pace would need to be 5 times faster to even have a chance to do it, based solely on the info provided.

Also ""Entire crystal hollows"" is a bit exaggerated I'd say üòÖ 


However it is still impressive job!"
1,YxqdJtXNQkw,Now do it with all 4

1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,Showing emotions and expressing feelings to a narcissist is like bleeding right next to a Shark.They'll use your weakness to hurt you one day.
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,The courage in this woman is above the sea level............
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,There's nothing like forgiveness once your partner catches you cheating
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,"She wanted to cheat all along. The so called revenge is just a scapegoat. She cheated, he cheated. Leave revenge out of this."
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,This is why you should never forgive a cheating partner because you will never forget. The best way to solve disloyalty is parting ways forever. Waachane tu.
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,"When a woman decides to revenge,even the devil sits back to take notes"
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,The cocktail of emotions here is something else
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,"Men,if you don't want to be cheated on stay loyal, cheating hurts atleast he has felt it..good job babygalüëèüëènobody forgives cheating üòÖ cheating is never an accident."

1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,Fear a woman silent after getting scorned. She just figured out your demise.
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,"Making yourself happy again is the biggest comeback, no need for revenge"

1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,Revenge is not a solution..Just heal and move on
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇI love her confidence
1,6Ri1Rzv--f4,"That's why I always say when your partner cheats, just break up. Don't even dare listen to words such as ""sorry"", ""I can explain"",, ""it was just a mistake"". All those words can solve nothing.. separation is the only way out"

1,jsnCQ51aVtc,You should try making some of the NYT cookie week cookies from this year!! Particularly the gochujang ones  üòÉ
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"ROLL CAKES! From the classic B√ªche de No√´l, to a pumpkin roll, to a jelly roll, to a cinnamon roll to a Swiss roll, there‚Äôs so many insanely delicious roll cakes & they scream holiday. Before my mom came out of the closet and left my step dad, I had a parent who went to culinary school in France. He would make B√ªche de No√´l during the Christmas season for us and they are to me the quintessential Christmas cake. I even learned to make them. Then I discovered pumpkin rolls (I suggest trading out the cream cheese frosting for mascarpone bc mascarpone is insane and you don‚Äôt like cream cheese), then roll cakes with fruit. (I want one made with strawberries or raspberries with mascarpone.) Roll cakes are also just such an beautiful aesthetic, especially if you pull out the stops for decorations. I just use holy on my B√ªche de No√´l cakes but there‚Äôs the classic egg white mushrooms too."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Hi David! I messaged you on instagram a good while back about this recipe recommendation. It‚Äôs called a chocolate nemesis and it is a flourless chocolate cake/mousse combo, one of my favourite desserts and so yummy! Definitely take a look if you‚Äôre looking for more pudding recipes. ‚ù§Ô∏è your videos always make me hungry lol I get a craving for baking and/or cooking after watching!üòä"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Dear David, thank you for your entertaining videos.  I like how you give props to others and I like how you acknowledge fails.  I see how your skills are improving unlike some who I think purposely make mistakes.  I just see food waste with those videos. Keep up the good work.  Your acting bits are quite funny as well. Have a lovely Christmas.‚ù§üéÖüèº"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"You should do a biscotti competition! I love Chef John‚Äôs recipes, he has an almond one and a gingerbread flavored one. I make biscotti every year and I this year I‚Äôm using Chef John‚Äôs gingerbread biscotti recipe as a starting point for ‚ÄúBiscoff-ti‚Äù üòÇ"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,That last one is a recipe we‚Äôve been making since I was little - or at least a very close variant XD They‚Äôre SO good! Seeing that pop up in one of your videos really made me happy to see especially since it‚Äôs usually one of our families Christmas deserts hehe
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I love Sally's recipes, I've been baking according to them for a long time, the steps are always described clearly, she includes both cup and metric measurements and gives tips for swaps/techniques. even though I have to put a tiny bit less sugar in the frostings than the recipe says, since European baking is less sweet traditionally but overall her recipes rock ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Sally has some of the BEST recipes!! I‚Äôve been using her carrot cake recipes for years and her tres leches cake is top tier too!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"My subscription box company Two Witches Whimsy is including this amazing Juniper Hazelnut Chocolate Cookie recipe this month! It's SUPER unique! I'll share it here:
-2 tsp whole juniper berries            
-8oz unsalted butter, softened          
-1 cup packed brown sugar 
-¬Ω tsp salt                                          
-2 tsp vanilla extract                            
-1¬æ cups flour
-¬æ cup Dutch cocoa powder            
-6oz toasted hazelnuts                        
-¬æ cup milk chocolate     
-1 cup raw sugar (optional)
Place the juniper berries in a dry pan over medium heat and dry roast for a few minutes. When you start to smell the berries, take them off the heat and let cool. Place the cooled juniper berries in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind them. The result will be slightly wet and sticky. 
Add butter, brown sugar, salt, vanilla and juniper berry paste to a large bowl or mixer bowl. With a hand mixer or stand mixer (with a paddle attachment), mix until the butter and sugar are well mixed and creamy - DO NOT beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the sifted flour and sifted cocoa powder, folding to incorporate. Then add the hazelnuts and milk chocolate chunks and mix. Divide the dough in half. Form a 2-2 ¬Ω inch diameter cookie dough log with each of the dough portions. Wrap each log in plastic wrap (knotting the ends tightly).
Refrigerate until the cookie dough is firm (1-2 hours or overnight).
To bake, line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Sprinkle the raw sugar on a flat plate, then unwrap one of the cookie dough logs and roll the log in the raw sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut off the tapered end of the cookie dough log.
Then cut ‚Öì inch thick slices. Please note that because of the nuts and chocolate chips, you 
may not get clean slices, so reshape the cookies into rounds when they don‚Äôt cut cleanly. Roll the edges in the raw sugar again if you need to.
Place the cookies on the lined baking sheet. Each log should make about 10 -12 cookies. Cover the lined baking sheet with plastic wrap/parchment paper/or another baking tray and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minute before baking. This chilling is important to allow the cookies to keep their shape while baking.
While the cookies are chilling, preheat the oven to 325¬∞F. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes. The cookie edges will be slightly firm and the middle will be soft but they will firm up as they cool. When the cookies have cooled down, remove them from the baking tray and place them on a wire rack.
The cookies will be crunchy on the outside and fudgy in the middle, and go great with hot cocoa!

*Note: You can also roll out the dough and use festive cookie cutters. If you choose to do this, roll out the dough to the desired thickness before refrigerating."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,David always mentioning those tasty fudgy brownies lol KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!! ‚ù§
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"i still make the mexican hot chocolate brownies from one of your other videos religiously. so excited to try these ones, especially bc i LOVE mint"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Claire has put out a BUNCH of new recipes from her new book! Will you do one please?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"""Chocolate and mint are such an underrated combination.""
I don't think anyone does that."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I used this exact same mint chocolate brownie recipe for my partner's birthday a couple months ago and I'm planning on baking them again for a Christmas potluck! 
I'm still in high school and don't have much experience with baking but these are pretty straightforward and fun to bake. Would highly recommend eating with milk, though; these things are delicious but very rich"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"My mom used to make mint brownies like that years ago for Christmas. So seeing you make it brings back memories of helping her. 
Also I keep waiting for people to start up the trend of the Italian cookies Pizzelle. They are so good, thin and crispy and the best part is they can be slightly customizable. I‚Äôve eaten lemon ones, chocolate ones, maple ones, and the original. All so good. And I‚Äôd love to see you make them one day."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,My favourite brownie recipe is Adam's regusia condensed milk brownies. It's so easy but absolutely delicious
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Love this! There's no such thing as too many brownie recipes (or too many David Seymour videos.) I've visited Sally's Baking Edition on and off for years; nice blog, good recipes.  ‚ù§Ô∏èMint chocolate chip brownies! This is an excellent retro classic from the 80s. They're really good."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Hi David! I would recommend trying out Grand Patisserie's recipe of their Christmas Icebox Cookies! I got their video recommended to me, and they look absolutely cute and delicious. You can find the recipe on their YouTube channel :)"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Hi David, if you‚Äôre looking for a Canadian holiday recipe that‚Äôs similar to a brownie (but better), check out Nanaimo Bars. 
Quite sweet, so you‚Äôd want them to be cut into tiny pieces. But damn, so good."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Please do more Sally recipes! I love her desserts!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I love how David went from hating the Special Dark Cocoa Powder because it ruined his brownies, to using it in most of the recipes where it calls for cocoa powder."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Sally‚Äôs mint chocolate chip brownies are one of my go-to recipes. So excited to see them featured here!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"My go to brownie recipe is Claire Saffitz‚Äôs Malted Forever Brownies. I add 1/2 cup chopped nuts, swap for all dark chocolate, add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, half the salt, and add 1tsp of baking powder. Bake for 35 minutes. I omit the malt powder because the can is $6 lol"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"5:48
maybe as a holiday sweet covered in chocolate? 
cut them into small squares and cover in chocolate and you have fudgy brownie bites , it would cut the richness a bit because you skip the ganache but you still have the super fudgy brownie :D"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I made those mint chocolate brownies last year around this time of year. I think I would've liked them better if I used spearmint extract instead of peppermint. I also thought they were very sweet, i spread the ganache over the top though."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"In my family we call mint chocolate chip brownies ""crack brownies"". Haha. I use the same recipe you did and they are truly incredible and decadent."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Those mint chocolate chip brownies look sexy af. Reminds me of those Andes chocolate mints you get at Olive Garden
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I would love if you did anything with ginger spice cookies or any spiced holiday cookie. They're personally my favorite during the holidays
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I've seen and tried those mint chocolate brownie before. They have been around for quite a few years. But very morish lol
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"thank you for the amazing content, david<3 been here since 2016!!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,So with the white chocolate brownie I would say as long as it tastes good that's all that matters. With the second brownie I might reverse the ratio and have a dark chocolate brownie with a milk chocolate ganache? And with the last brownie well you can't go wrong with that combination. Great job!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I think you should have a go at the ultimate chocolate cake by Erin over at food 52, tried it last Christmas and it came out amazing!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,The mint chocolate brownie looked delicious ü§§
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"My favorite brownie recipe is a cocoa powder brownie, I think I'll try to add the mint frosting to it, sounds delicious"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"I think you should try out ""Ghorayeba"" it's an Egyptian shortbread cookie, it's gonna be something new try and I hope you'll like it!!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"As someone who hates chocolate, i have to thank you for introducing me to white chocolate brownies omg"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Try the 20 ingredient vs 10 ingredient vs 2 ingredient brownies, or compare the 150-Hour Chocolate Cake to Tasty's Ultimate Chocolate Cake."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Yuck for white chocolate. But the chocolate mint brownie looks fantastic!! üòÄüòã‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§I like your style, David, and I love your videos about anything chocolate (unless it is white)!!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Have you made the Adam raggusea brownies I think you'll love them, they use condensed milk. And sorry for my spelling"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,you should make stella park's brownies!!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,The mint ones look so good.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,question--- what do you do with all your leftover food? when i cook and theres anything left over it all just seems to go to waste
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"the problem people have with white chocolate, is mostly because white chocolate is not actual chocolate since it doesnt have any cocoa particles
is just cocoa butter mixed with sugar and water
its also a bit finicky to work with because it have a lower melting point"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Hey would you ever try a brownie cookie, like Nebokgeom's giant brownie cookies with the cute chocolate eyes?"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,You should try pecan pie cookies!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,the mint brownies ü§©ü§§
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"also if you are up to it. maybe ask your subscribers for christmas cookie recipes . it would be fun to watch a ""cookie around the world"" series :)"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,As a fan of mint choc ice cream these mint brownies had me drooling
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"DAVID!! pretty please do bon appetite‚Äôs chocolate chip cookie (Chris‚Äôs recipe) vs. Alvin‚Äôs 2 hour chocolate chip cookie!
I‚Äôve made both of them, but I find that chris‚Äô taste better, but Alvin‚Äôs looks better, but I‚Äôm so curious what you think!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"What about trying different types of ‚Äògingerbread‚Äô? Like a crunchy gingerbread, gingersnaps, and a chewy spice cookie. Every year I make chewy spice cookies that are positively sinful, with enough allspice that the cookie bites you back. They taste like gingerbread but I don‚Äôt like calling them that because they‚Äôre not crunchy and if you tried making gingerbread men out of them you‚Äôd just end up with really dirty snowmen blobs."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,My favorite cake to make is an Earl Grey cake with a Chocolate Lavender buttercream frosting
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,That last brownie sounds like the perfect way to torture Golden Gully.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I am living for this christmas background!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Can you try recreating the recipes from Claire Saffitz's books? I feel like these brownie and odd tiktok concotions are getting a bit redundant.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I personally love white chocolate over milk. So I would like the white chocolate brownies
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,South african melk tart. Basically a custard tart with cinnamon. Super tasty.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I‚Äôm gonna make those mint chocolate brownies for sure
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,You should check out some Rosanna Ponsino cookie recipes. I don't think I have seen you do any of her recipes on the channel and she's currently doing 25 days of cookie recipes so that might be a goldmine for a unique cookie recipe
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Can we talk about how expensive heavy cream became?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I wonder whether you would taste some viral street food from different countries.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Still really want to see you do ARs brownies and see how they compare
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Not cookies, but I do have the best recipe for cinnamon rolls.. possibly ever?  I developed it over quite a few years. Once a month I bake cinnamon rolls and sell them to friends and family. I‚Äôve been told they are the best, but I honestly can‚Äôt eat them because I can‚Äôt have gluten. Let me know if you‚Äôd like *possibly* the worlds best cinnamon roll recipe."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,David give Butter Mochi a try. It‚Äôs like a cross between mochi and a brownie as it‚Äôs baked in the oven. I know your allergic to nuts and it can be made without coconut milk.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,The second one looks like it needs some rising agent in there.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I love mint. And miss things like that a lot
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Noooooo the fulll coverage topping to those mint brownies are the best parttttt
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Should try Sumbitches from HIMYM, those things are awesome"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Love the content David! You should do some version of a homemade Levain cookie for your next dessert video! I‚Äôm doing a peanut butter/Reese‚Äôs variation for my family holiday party!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Love from Australia, please do coconut ice."
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Chocominto wins again. Ultimate flavor combo
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Soooo considering it‚Äôs a Christmas video not doing a peppermint version was and absolutely epic fail‚Ä¶. Maybe next year.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,You should try making Crumbl Cookies?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Great work David
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Oooh brownies!  Taking notes now‚Ä¶
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Toffee nut brown butter cookies are my go to
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,what about a round of boozy egg nog recipes?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"You haven't done biscotti yet...
Also eggless desserts"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Dear David, if you REALLY want to hate the Unholy song.  Dan Povenmire sings it in Doofenshmirtz's voice.  Yeah... I lost brain cells.  The brownies look GREAT!!"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,The white chocolate brownie looks just like butter cake!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Try the New York Times olive shortbread
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"My dude, what about a cheesecake recipe video?"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Yum the mint!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"You gotta put some pecans in there, my friend"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,The white chocolate brownie looked somewhere very knishy
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,6:42 Rip that egg shell
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Mint chocolate is best ü•∞
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Please make b√ªche de No√´l!
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"Forget Patreon, I'm waiting for the OF"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Unholy was the right song for that second brownie because they look as God awful as that song.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Don't have a recipe but chocolate orange brownies?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Saw this on Instagram xD
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Red velvet cheesecakes or milk & cookies cake
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,"God Bless David Seymour üôèüèªüç™
God Bless President Trumpüôèüèªüá∫üá∏"
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,White chocolate isn‚Äôt chocolate at all. There‚Äôs 0% cacao. It‚Äôs just sugar.
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm semi-early ü•≥ü•≥
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Wow no tastys brownies in the vid?
1,jsnCQ51aVtc,Thanks!

1,LhoqKmZ4GQQ,"Hello Lilly, what a beautiful video you have produced. To see your entire beautiful family, made me shed a few tears. You traveling to different places in Thailand is making me confused. When you make up your mind to settle in one place, then I will make up my mind to travel. When I travel this time it could be my last. I just had a friend today at my place, what would cost him 2 thousand for air tickets to go overseas. It is going to cost him now close to 6 grand. The price of airfares have risen so much that I feel it is ridiculous to travel now. The reason I shed a few tears. Is because I got a nasty comment from one of the viewers. I only hope that person sees this video and realise, that you are a beautiful human being, and God has blessed you with a beautiful family. Love you all, take care, stay safe, keep smiling, and God Bless you all."

1,m64OdZn-uAM,"Marie, it's good to see you again.  Last time I told you that you had inspired me to go outdoors and collect some forage for my Thanksgiving decor.

1,m64OdZn-uAM,You r doing great one good tip for mental well being and good health is to stay clear of alcohol and drinking around the holidays and other people that drink alot as it can cause set backs in anyone's mental health now a small drink or toast is okay but being around social alcoholic people can also bring mental upset so surrounding yourself with clean living as well as tranquility is your key marrie glad u r finding success much love from California  üá∫üá∏

1,3LeaucKc3PM,Having struggled with depression for many years I can understand what you are talking about.  There is definitely light at the end of the tunnel.  I have had therapy for years and am still on medications daily to help me.  I have wonderful family and friends who have been there for me and stood by me no matter what.  You can do this.
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, we are here to support you. You are so talented and caring. Wishing you the best. You deserve it."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"I always say, look at the step and not the stairs. Life may surprise you. Like a jigsaw puzzle everything will fit into place. Just believe in yourself Marie. You are incredible, talented and a beautiful soul üòò"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,Good for you for not ‚Äúsettling‚Äù for the first job that comes along Marie.  I am certain you will find a good fit soon and you will face the New Year with a smile and a happy heart‚ù£Ô∏è
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Those moments aren't failures, Marie, it is just knowledge gained from life moments! These are just lessons you have achieved in your path in life. As you get older you will look back and be so grateful for all this knowledge you have, beautiful memories of the places you have been, and friends you have made along the way! Enjoy the journey ü•∞"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hang in there, sweetheart.  Your niche in the world will arrive in due time.  Have faith. This is all going to work out."

Warmest thoughts all the way from New Jersey in the US‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Praying for you,  Marie.   Depression is a lifelong disease and requires appropriate therapy and medication.  Don't give up.   I have been living with it for 63 years. It ebbs and flows.
Just look back at the episodes you have made it through and it will give you courage to make it through whatever hits you.  Journal about gratitude üôè"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Remember that there are lots of people out here who value you enough to watch your journey because we like who you are and can relate.

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Ohhh, dear Marie.....this momma bear sends you the biggest hug sweet soul.  Life can feel so cruel at times and trust me, at one time or another, we all have felt lost trying to find our place in it and our way through the muck.  You are never alone in your struggles, though I know it may feel that you are, please know that so many of us have felt the same way or have children who have.  Change is hard and scary at best, you will find your way and when this is all behind you, you will smile a genuinely happy smile.  Love from a momma bear in Michigan, USA"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hello, Marie! Best wishes to you as you explore various florista possibilities! Anyone who has the privilege of hiring you would be very lucky to have such a talented artist on staff!!

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie please do not be so hard on yourself. Remember that the whole world had 2 years of uncertainty. In all that uncertainty that we've gone through, it was very hard for a lot of businesses to hold on or even to succeed, so please don't feel that you failed‚ô•Ô∏è"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Love you, Marie! Think of you often and am glad you are searching for that perfect fit for your amazing self. Hang in there. You‚Äôve created it before and you will again. Each journey grows us a little more and teaches us something. You are beautiful and so so talented. Hugs!!"

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hi Marie, it's good to see you getting on and trying to figure what works best for you, the flower shop was so cute and the views out the windows was beautiful, the town was very picturesque, but it wasn't in your heart so that's ok don't be sad and down on yourself, being able to walk away from what's not the right fit, into what will be is real courage. The wreaths were absolutely beautiful, looking forward to your next video, with much love from N.Y."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hi Marie, remember, there are no failures when you are working to better your health and thus your life. I trust you and hope you know that there are those of us who value you and your journey. Try to remember how much you have taught and inspired folks about the beauty of flowers and foliage.

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hang in there love. My almost 27 year old daughter is going through this too. This world is so hard for everyone right now, but especially for the young. Is hard finding a place where you belong and where you can be happy. I‚Äôm struggling with that too. Some people can jump right in and just go about their business but it‚Äôs those of us creative spirits that feel we never fit in or that nothing ever seems to be the right fit. All we can do is make the most of this world and sweetheart, no to get religious on you, but when I got closer to GOD, I became much happier. This is our temporary world, the real one lies ahead‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,What helps me most is prayer and making lists of all the things that I am grateful for.  Hugs to you!

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, you are such a lovely person. We missed your blog's so much. I'm glad you share your life again with us"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Cheering you on from a wintery spot in Saskatchewan! You have my support! I've been through something similar, and my heart feels for you! There is a plan for you in all this, but sometimes we look back and can see the path behind us was leading us to good places, and we don't always see right away when we've arrived, till suddenly we know! And it's been tough but beautiful."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Tell yourself everyday ""I am enough, I am beautiful and I have something to offer!""  You truly are all these things. I'm so happy to see this video!"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie you will find your place in life and when you do you will know instantly that it is meant to be. All of us have life ups and downs, some put on a brave face and try to hide it , for others it shows in everything they are and do, just be yourself. Things will work out x"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,It is extremely brave of you to share your struggles and very personal feelings.  You are not alone.  Big hugs...from a fellow flower person.
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, trust your journey, the ups and downs will lead you to where you need to be.  Hugs!!!"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Once you have worked for yourself it is difficult to work for someone else. The mentality of the other workers is very different from yours. I would suggest you read Imagination by Neville Goddard. You are such a special and creative person and you can create the perfect life for yourself. Also other books by Neville are about ‚ÄúFeeling is the thing‚Äù.Please check them out. I went through exactly the same situation and went to a therapist. I quickly realized I was an emotionally healthy person (as I suspect you are too) living in a world with a lot of crazy people!!!! You are a beautiful soul and the business world does not support that. I had to deal with that my whole life I am 76 without loosing my soul. I learned as a young person at that time it was to escape the harsh reality of life, to visualize the exact world I wanted to live in right before I fell asleep. The key is to get excited and feel the joy of manifesting it! Learn to FEEL the joy, the wonder, the excitement of living the life you want. Put in as much detail as you can, the location, the home, the relationship(Not the person but their characteristics). Your own business and how successful, the shop, the beautify of it, your clients and how wonderful they are, that you are always making more money than you could ever possibly spend, and anything else you want in your life. When you fall asleep your subconscious works on the fastest and easiest way to create it. Sometimes it may seem it gets worse before better but that is part of the process. I have manifested travel around the world, a fur coat, the cars of my dreams. I have lived in 28 places because every time I thought I would like to live there within months I was there. I have had beautiful furnishings and great friends. The home I live in and the car I drive I visualized them exactly as they are before I fell asleep. Both were given to me!!!!! So please you don‚Äôt have mental issues you are a very creative person living in a crazy world that is harsh on the creative types. Please read Neville and Please visualize the wonderful life you can and will create before you go to sleep. I also take naps so I can visualize more!!!!! We all love you and recognize how special you are! Keep moving forward and take very good care of yourself!!!!!!"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Sorry to hear you're struggling.  I think many of us have gone through it at least once in life.  I have to ask (and we don't know the inner details) as to why you left LaLande.  You had a ""family"" and tremendous support amongst people who love you.  You had your own space for flower arranging.  As youtube viewers it appeared you had it all living at LaLande."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Oh Marie, so sorry to hear you're going through this. One day at at time, if that's too much one minute at a time. I've been battling with depression for years and know how difficult it is, especially when you're a creative person and feel you can't create. I found I just needed to give myself time, to get back to being ""me"" again. You will get through it. It's good if you can just find someone you can just talk to when you need to vent."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, I really like who you are. I enjoy watching your journey, the ups and downs. Perseverance is highly under-rated, but it is how we survive past traumas when our mind realizes what we saw and experienced, with garbled clarity. Have you considered the USA...you'd fit right in. I envision you in the Pacific Northwest along with the desert Southwest, discovering the beauty of desert floral. You have an innovative talent towards creating beauty out of nature. Innovators are a rare commodity of intrinsic value. Girl, you are no cookie cutter. Thanks for letting me chill with you in your vlog."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hi Marie, don't be sad and down hearted. You have achieved so many wonderful things over the last couple of years including keeping us all going during lockdown with uploading the most wonderful vlogs. You are a very talented florist and I just know you will find the right job for you soon!"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, i am nearly 70 years old and i had to start new so offen in my live - so believe me: the right Job/ the right way will come, try not to give up, stay open and let it come! 
Be blessed ü•∞"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Dear Marie - all will be well. You are very talented with a kind, compassionate and very empathetic soul. Sometimes it is the job we do now that will take us to the job we will end up doing, so just breathe. All jobs are difficult in different ways and none are perfect but you will find the right place. 2023 WILL be your year. With love from England xx"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,Hugs. Wishing all the best in your search.
1,3LeaucKc3PM,Marie sending lots of hugs & good vibes. Wishing you a new year of beginnings & happiness. I‚Äôm sure Stephanie at LaLande has a place for you. Set up your own florist room & film videos. You looked happiest when you were there.
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"What picturesque scenery and accommodation you stayed in Marie!! Your videos are always filled with such beauty, honesty and genuine kindness which is what the world needs more of and why I missed your videos so much! You have the most beautiful soul. Thank you for sharing your journey as we can relate to you & you touch our hearts in so many ways. Wishing you find the right fit soon, as I‚Äôm sure you will! I say to my children, be kind to others as to how you want to be treated in life, so I‚Äôm sure only good things are on your horizon with a good soul like yours! ü•∞"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hi Marie, When l worked in London, my friend said: Family may not be ideal but it's good to have them. Looking back, it was good advice from an English girl and in fact l returned to my family . l live in a village now and there's more community spirit here than my own town.
There was one lovely video of you and your mum. Have a lovely Christmas."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie you are a beautiful young woman stay strong. Einstein said life is like a bicicycle ride, to keep your balance you must keep going forward. May God bless you."

1,3LeaucKc3PM,Hang in there Marie. Huge hug from a normally silent follower
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Dear Marie, it's so good to see you back, making beautiful floral creations in beautiful places. Depression can be so difficult. Often it's a natural reaction to life situations. Sometimes it encompasses us like a dark fog, playing with our thoughts and emotions, stealthily absorbing our desire and ability to live. So we do our best, as we are able. Know that you have a great number of friends and support from around the world. We all want to see you thrive. You are so very talented. Sending a hug and much love from across the pond,
Karin

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, I hope you find the perfect job for you. Maybe it is not in the industry that you have your heart set or is in a different way to what you are thinking.
My daughter had depression for a long time. She did many university courses but in the end chose something completely different to what she was trained for, or, maybe it chose her.
As time went on she has been very happy and has kept busy with work and family. Keeping busy is the way to go even if it is just in a voluntary capacity to begin with.
Stay positive and healthy and do what is right for you."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Jacqueline writing- always appreciate checking in on you- sooooo proud of you and your INCREDIBLE COURAGE to be able to share with us how you are feeling even at this challenging time- when you showed yourself crying i just let my tears flow- i was so moved and inspired by being able to ""sit"" with you in that moment. I was not sad that you were crying - my heart opened that you were crying and sharing that with us. Social media is for sure a very mixed bag of helpful  and so much sharing of "" look how great my life is"" is definitely sometimes in the very unhelpful. I am remembering where you told us you listened to your heart  and left a day early- this year i will again be placing live green decorations on our family celebration tables- inspired from watching you at LaLande couple of years ago-  never underestimate how your sharing ripples out in beauty and appreciation of nature for others years on xxxxxx"

Keep your head up girly, you are a gem and so amazingly talented. I love that you‚Äôre uploading content again. I have really missed seeing your videos. I am a fellow florist in the states. Your videos give me a glimpse of the beauty and process of life in Europe. 

You are so talented, keep your chin up."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie, thank you for sharing your journey, you are a wonderful person, immensely talented, super strong, and with a great sense of what is right or not for you, it is great to follow your heart, keep doing that.

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Seasons greetings beautiful Marie. Your world 
is so real to me. Having had chronic anxiety & chronic depression for years. Having been through 54 counselors, 9 psychologists & 10 psychiatrists. That was my world for over 20 years.
I was a survivor of rape throughout my life.
Deep down in my soul, I knew that I'd heal myself naturally. I did, without any antidepressants. The last predator was locked up, & eventually jailed. He was my sisters partners son. He also raped my niece who was 10 at that time. His half sister. At that stage I was oblivious to everything, being traumatized after the event, & past episodes.
I attribute my healing to having wonderful supportive daughters, loving caring parents & my grandchildren, & unconditional faith, however hard it got. My mates, my cousins, extended nieces & nephews, were brilliant. 
I recieved more support from them far more than my own siblings. Because I took the case through to court & the justice system, until he was convicted, people started off loading their sexual abuse stories to me. In order to start my healing I had to go through all of their stories & help heal them first. I was also suicidal 7 times. A lot of people wouldn't admit that, but I've always kept things blatantly real. This helps you in so many ways. A lot of people really don't know how to take your honesty. Now my whole life is so different Marie. I'm stronger, wiser, have a beautiful totally blessed life, with so many people who love me, it's magical. 
I know you can do it too.
Like you, I'm also a florist. I love being outside in my garden & nature. I also do yoga, meditate, do Tai chi, kick box, & don't give stuff what people think about me.üòÅThat's important too. You do you, it's your life not someone elses.
You are the one who makes the ultimate decisions for you. You can do it Marie. Surround yourself with supportive loving people, like the Lalanders, your family & close friends. Do things you love to do, & slowly your life will change.
Much love & light beautiful Marie...one other thing I do.üòÅ
...pray 24/7 for everyone.

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Thank you for being so honest and vulnerable. I too know a struggle with depression, anxiety, meeting your own expectations and feeling a sense of requirement to meet the expectations of those around you. I‚Äôve learned I‚Äôm too hard on myself but continue to move forward balancing expectations and reality, while exploring the opportunities each season of life has to offer. Keep creating and let your soul shine because it is a beautiful one we all see and hope you can recognize in yourself more days than not."

1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Sweet Marie!  So glad that you're sharing your journey with us; I had no idea you were having problems, but want to wish you the best and hope that you're feeling good about yourself again; you are such a talented person and sweet and I love your smile!  I had no idea you were from Norway, it's so beautiful there; glad that you're home and around people that you love.  It takes courage to go through this and I know you'll make it!  (from Sandi)"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"I can totally relate. This year, I decided to pursue my dream career and there have been so many heart breaking moments where I felt like a failure and should just throw the towel in. But I‚Äôm still persisting and waiting for the universe to answer my call. I hope you can find comfort in knowing there are others going through the same thing. And like many like us in the past, we shall overcome and achieve!"
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie,  Many of us understand what you're going through.  Been there, done that sort of thing.  We think of you and send our prayers.   You also have such a greater support from all those that love you.  Sometimes it's one step forward two steps back.  Soon it will be the opposite.  Then you'll be making each and every step forward.  Keep moving and trust in yourself."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Marie,  I am so sorry to hear you say that you struggled with mental health issues during last year.  You don‚Äôt deserve to go through that depression or anxiety or whatever it is.  I am a mental health professional and I wish you would consider seeing someone to give you the support you need. You have many devoted followers who love your content, but that is not apparently providing you with the needed support.   I am glad you are going home to be with your friends and family."
1,3LeaucKc3PM,"Hello Marie! I am feeling a lot of similar feelings to you right now too. Sometimes for me it can feel like riding an angry sea on a small boat . You are putting one foot in front of the other and doing things that are right for you. Keep on your journey forward to you, and know the clouds will part again. No matter what you do you are enough. üåª

Recently I've been listening to a lot of Enya's greatest hits to wake up my inner child because it's familiar of times that were endless summers. Wishing you the best!"

You‚Äôll find your next happy place soon I know it!!! xx
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I don‚Äôt know why but Tachibana just stopping by to warn them and akamatsu coming home bruised anyway got me badüòÇ also, Etra made a cameo? Yes please!üòç"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Karin's right, Akamatsu is terrible with woman after Yuzuriha found out that he's been cheating on her. And Tachibana too, he came to Karin to tell her the truth about Akamatsu. No girls will ever go out with him after they found out that he's cheating on all women after Yuzuriha exposed him to the girls but going after someone's girlfriend is a last straw"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"""Excuse me!? I didn't do shit!""
It's so weird to see Karin swear. But at the same time I like it."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Etra's getting more screen time. It's so good to see.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Etra should appear in her own videos more often. That I would like to see
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"This is basically a repeat of the last Akamatsu/Karin sibling story where Akamatsu was a cheater. Though I prefer this one because Karin at least seemed to have tried to steer Akamatsu straight, while in the last one, she didn't even bother."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"*Karin:* He was having an affair with 5 different women! I don‚Äôt know who could do that‚Ä¶
*Akane:* Hold my beer!"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I applaud Karin and her family for treating this idiot still so nicely. I would have admonished, repremanded and punished him several times during his school days for his DISGUSTING behavior.
And as soon as that happened to Yuzuriha, I would have forced him to pay all his savings to Yuzuriha as compensation (they werent engaged jet, but on the way there) and then kicked him out!
He should first pull himself together for a few years before he's even allowed to talk to the family again."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I heard somewhere that nymphomania is a real mental disorder. This Akamatsu seems to fit the bill for that; he really seemed serious about Yuzuriha.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I see Etra-chan is starting to be more than just a background character
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akamatsu Ducked around and Found Out... and on Yuzuriha of all people. 

Either way, always fun to see Yuzu use her oni powers üòÅ"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akumatsu probably *was* serious about Yuzuriha. The problem is, like a lot of cheaters, he really can't take responsibility for his own cheating actions. He can't have it both ways, but he wants both ways anyway."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"It‚Äôs nice that young Tachibana tried to give them a good warning, but Akamatsu brought it on himself‚Ä¶ OH SHIT!üò® now it‚Äôs YUZURIHA‚ÄôS turn!? This isn‚Äôt gonna end well‚Ä¶. not at all‚Ä¶"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I'm so happy. It's another Yuri and Katsura pairing.

So happy that Karin got a happy ending. Wow Etra chan so cute.

Akamatsu needs to learn his lesson not to mess with girls. Akamatsu doesn't need Yuzuriha our any other girls. He need to be single for the rest of his life. So he will not hurt any girls again."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Etra chan has polished her acting skills .... Now she started becoming multi talented lady day by day love to see her daily after seeing her from now onwards in acting career üòäüòäüôÇüôÇ
Now seen all the female actresses in on go üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akamatsu : ""What?! I'm the only one at fault?!""
Me : Is that even a question?"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Serves him right like akamatsu clearly hasn‚Äôt changed a bit
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I almost thought they were going to adapt that episode from the start of the second anniversary episode (the One Yuzuriha caught Akamatsu cheating on her with Akane). Etra-chan dating Akamatsu was unexpected
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Akamatsu... dating Etra!? What the!!? But he is again a cheater...
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Well Akamatsu got what he deserves for being a womanizerüò° even at a young ageüíî and now he‚Äôs paying the ultimate priceüòà while his sister Karin is happily engagedüíõüíç.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"First of all Akamatsu is really the enemy of women, I guess he'll never learn but who cares about him I'm more exited when Etra chan made another rare appearance. Great story but when will we ever see John again?"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I can‚Äôt believe he dated Etta Chan. That is something too crazy.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Yeah, no. If my siblings ever tried that crap on me, only to follow up with ""It's all your fault!"" Not only would I beat the hell out of them, but they would never be a part of my life."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Oh my god is this one the truth! My brother is much older than means as the younger sister I saw every girl he would rotate through every few days. He‚Äôd have at least one new girlfriend a week if not 3 or 4 that he‚Äôd be ‚Äúso in love with‚Äù and was ‚Äúgonna marry‚Äù etc etc.. Most of these people he met online but some were from bars and parties. Every single time he‚Äôd seem so normal with them but then suddenly snap and become extremely verbally (never physically) aggressive, threatening to kill himself and crap when he didn‚Äôt get his way about something. Then storm out of the house and disappear for hours after screaming at the poor girl. I was 14 and comforting these 18-20 year old girls while my 22 year old brother was throwing temper tantrums. If they asked me if that‚Äôs what he was really like I‚Äôd never lie to them, I‚Äôd always tell them the truth about him and tell them to run. And then when he‚Äôd come home and they‚Äôd dump him it was my fault and he‚Äôd start screaming at me, calling names like worthless and a POS sister and just make the whole situation my fault. Nothing was ever his fault. It‚Äôs still the same even now too. He‚Äôs 36, bed hopping all over the country and nothing is ever his fault. But at least I‚Äôm on minimal contact with him so nothing is ever my fault anymore. The fault is everyone else‚Äôs.

But I will say a few of this girls have been at mutual fault or 100% at fault in these situations because with a revolving door of women some of them have been fucking psycho. Like once a woman physically assaulted him and left him torn up accusing him of being a lying cheating POS (he is) and then attacked me (I was 16) and tried to choke me and pull out my hair because she thought he and I were somehow fucking each other behind her back. She didn‚Äôt believe we were actually siblings because we look nothing alike. Like seriously bitch we are HALF siblings! Same mom different dads. Ever heard such a phenomenon? He takes after his dad in pretty much every way. I was able to fight her off until help arrived luckily. Some people are just pure psycho"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"You know, I was actually kinda hoping this was going in a different direction. I mean, at first, we never actually saw what Akamatsu was doing with any of those girls, that could have been used to set up some kind of twist into something more wholesome. Oh well, maybe next time."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Having a playboy for a brother is big shame. What a big loser Akamatsu is, not only he got caught again cheating infront of his but now that he lost Akane and his friends he still hasn't see his mistake and blame others, seriously what a loser, he's the only bad apple in the family. I have to agree with Karin, he deserves to be single forever if he can't fix himself"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Ah yes, the Demon Yuzuriha strikes again-"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Yosh. The other brother Akamatsu who can't keep his pants in and keeps going around with other girls. His family were actually more merciful this time to let him stay in the house even after the trouble he caused, maybe they could still throw him out or get him to work harder at least.

Akamatsu dated this universe's Etra."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Tricking Yuzu? He got off lucky. She could have went much further after wasting the last 5 years of her life.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Sounds like one of my ex-bestfreinds.... ü§£ü§£ü§£I went out of town to see the new baby in the family and she got in so much trouble between two guys...AND blamed me cause I wasn't there to stop or cover for her
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Karin: God damnit Akamatsu!
Akamatsu: Hey I‚Äôm just going with the script 
Karin: Whatever. Check if you have any STDs.

*later*

Akamatsu: AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Hiragii: yeah maybe he should‚Äôve used a condom for that scene
Karin: Eyup."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Akamatsu got Yuzuriha (Good Version) and still decided to cheat? Serves him right! XD
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"When you're Akamatsu, cheating is a sure way to losing. Proven by Etra."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"*Akamatsu:* Don‚Äôt come into my room.
*Me:* Relatable but also I don‚Äôt even wanna know what‚Äôs happening inside that room."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akamatsu isn't just terrible with women, he's also terrible of keeping promises for them. AND when that Promise is broken, he gets scolded by others after cheating with another woman, then things turn to a bad ending for him when things go downhill
for the red-headed idiot."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Lol the first girl Akamatsu brought home was Etra Chan herself? üòÇ

‚Ä¶oh boy, cheating on Yuzuriha with Akane. That‚Äôs not good‚Ä¶the last time I saw a video where that happened (though with Hiiragi instead of Akamatsu) Yuzu tried to hire hitmen to kill Akane üòÖ"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Akamatsu dating Yuzu. I can't wait to see how this turns out. I have a bad feeling about this. Years later Akamatsu didn't think he did anything wrong. SMH
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akamatsu: ""What, I'm the only one at fault?
Everyone: YES!
Me: ü§£"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,‚ÄúHow could you become so happy when you‚Äôre the reason everything went to s***?‚Äù Um news flash akamatsu: YOU were the one who cheated on Yuzuriha and YOU were the one who lied to her by telling akane was your sister.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Etra Chan. I'm pretty sure if you would d a te anyone, it's John.
Anyways, I'm pretty sure Akane and Yuzuriha also deserve someone better.
But I'm sure whoever Akamatsu dates behind the scenes must really care for him, regardless if it's Hiiragi or Akane"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Yuzuriha can be a catastrophic woman than the others. She is number one danger because she hates liar and cheater.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I really dont get people like Akamatsu....
He's blaming everyone else for his Problem and doesnt see what is wrong with cheating?!"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Continued all through highschool eh? I'm familiar with the cast of this show by now, so how many dates before Akamatsu looped back around to dating Etra Chan again? Was it awkward dating a girl that looked, sounded and had the same name as his sister? I need details!"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Wooow I really feel bad for Karin, who had to go through troubles because of playboy brother Akamatsu, who constantly keeps on cheating and playing around with women, that eventually he keeps getting slapped and punched! üò°ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòî. Anyhow I am glad that Karin, Katsura and Yuri are seriously fed up with him and chewed him out! And wooow when Karin got engaged, Akamatsu just blamed her for ruining his happiness, when it was actually his fault that he brought this upon himself! üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Honestly, it would‚Äôve been better if Karin, Katsura and Yuri just kicked him out until he finally realized his actions and repent it if he can ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,4:48 You know what I think guys? I think Yuzuriha is talking about Akane changing her real name to Karin.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I can't believe Etra chan involved herself to Akamatsu
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I hate that type of person. The kind of person who does something bad like cheating or playing a prank that goes too far, but acts like they're the victim. Notice how I said ""person"" because guys and girls do this, it's not limited"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,People with Akamatsu's character are the exact kind of people I have a burning desire to murk mercilessly!
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Of all the women he could cheat on the one you never do it to in this series would be Yuzuriha. I mean you don't cheat period but her wrath is almost always the worst.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"If Tokusa is their dad, he probably kick Akamatsu ass offü§£"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I'm just going to say it Karin's clothes for this were clean üëå
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Akamatsu dated Etra?! Damn! He's got game!
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"If I was in akamatsu's position (not that I would EVER want to be) I'd try and own up to my mistakes right. Well I'm sure I'd be angry enough at myself and everyone around me that I would cut ties with all family and friends as is a common occurrence for people. But after that I'd take a few years to improve my attitude, work ethic, and general overall health. After that I would return to my family with proof that I have changed for the better, apologize and try to move on with my life."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,What happened to akamatsu is exactly happened to my scumbag neighbor/ex best friend
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Just when I thought Akamatsu's Stupidity couldn't get Worse
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,*Akamatsu... dating Etra!? What the!!? But he is again a cheater...*
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,*Akamatsu... dating Etra!? What the!!? But he is again a cheater...*
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Even though he was planning to be serious with Yuzuriha, Akamatsu is still Akamatsu"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Manga: *shows an interesting story*
Me: hey look Etra has a cameo hehe :-3"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I wonder who is Karins fianc√© is? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs Tokusa.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"YarrowClaw: ""I will come back and get my revenge DarkPelt! and I swear upon the dark forest that I will kill you!""
*She was killed by the deputy DarkPelt after YarrowClaw attempted to poison him and then tried to kill the Leader directly*"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"7:30 
Dude you are at fault!
You we‚Äôre gonna get married and use you your sister to throw in front as like a dummy to take all that crap!
Karma always comes for her debts!!!!

But say garbage!
‚Äú why are you so happy when it‚Äôs all your fault!?!?!‚Äù"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,I mean what the hell did he expect you know the old saying play stupid games you'll win stupid prizes he certainly messed around and he found out the hard way. üòÇ
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Poor Etra for being the first akamatsu girl :3
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Man, Akamatsu dating Etra is something I never expect to see. 
Also, who is the girl at 2:17?"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Not only that he lied but he used his sister as an excuse to say that his cheating girlfriend is a relative and blamed his sister for it. He is pathetic and selfishness as crap.

L for that loser"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,5:47 I am wrong. Akamatsu LIED to Yuzuriha and used her sister's name to cover her lies.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Geez, Akamatsu's an idiot for cheating on the sweet as nectar Yuzuriha for that annoying valley girl Akane. What's he thinking anyway? In his place, I'd be content with Yuzuriha and wouldn't cheat on her.

To make matters worse, he blamed Karin for his mess? It was his own stupid fault in the first place so blaming his own sister for his problems is rotten....."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I‚Äôve said it before, and I will say it again. Gosh damn Akamastsu!"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Etra is so beautiful doing that cameo üòç
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,We gonna ignore how the first one was 1 year difference then the second was 2 years for the flash backs?
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Interesting story ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"If Karin was a lesbianüë≠ in this one, and had Yuzuriha as her wifeüíç. I would love to see Akamastu cry about over thatüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"best etra chan cameo,karin was supercute today."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,The only thing better than Tokusa being Tachibana‚Äôs brother is when Tachibana is his own brother
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Oh I'm on the same status as Akamatsu at the ending. Gonna be forever single cuz I know my flaws. Just don't want anyone to get hurt from my actions. It's just me and video games and anime.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Of course he hasn‚Äôt changed üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"1:06
Hey Etra ._.
6:23
Karin: Deja vu..."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,The dude got off lightly. Yuzu could have done so much worse.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Akamatsu got what he deserved. He didn‚Äôt even apologize to Karin and pathetically beg Yuzuriha to take him back.
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,So even Etra has a thing for Akamatsu! Huh?
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"*Yuzariha:* Hello, my name is Yuzariba!
*Later*
*Akamatsu:* Ugh‚Ä¶ Yuzurin!
*Earlier*
*Karin:* Nice to meet you Yuzariha!

*Me:* YUZARIHA IS YUZARIHA!"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,1:07 wait a sec‚Ä¶ ETRA?!
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,He cheated on yuzu he is doomed don‚Äôt mess with yuzu Karin is right he shouldn‚Äôt have cheated on yuzu it‚Äôs all his fault
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,Every time yuzuriha is the girlfriend shes very scary-
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"And just like that, we have Akamatsu dating women for their bodies. Again."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"I'm curious ü§î. 

Will Etra ever show more of that one guy character with the purple hair?"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Yuzuriha is the right to be made about being cheated on but going after another girlfriend is going to far
8:06 yes akamatsu u dunce"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,What was akamatsu doing dating miss etra?
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"If he was nice he wouldn't cheated lmao and if his serious he wouldn't cheated on his gf, akamatsu being jealous of his sister  is so immature"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"To be honest, these woman who date Akamatua in the beginning, had boyfriend. So they are also the problem."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"This is what comes of womanizing, fellas. It doesn't make you a player or a catch or whatever. In the end, it only makes you a fool."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,That‚Äôs what you get for cheating with Akane!
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Akamatsu broke guy code again. Suffering will be his teacher.

That's why i don't do dating"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Not sure if it was on purpose, but Yuzuriha's name is misspelled at least 4 different times in this video."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"TACHIBANA TRY TO WARN THEM, BUT IT TOO LATE. NOW IT YUZURIHA TURN. THE SWEAR IS SO FUNNY. üíôüíôüíñüíñüíòüíòüòäüòäü§óü§óüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£‚ú®‚ú®üéâüéâ"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,It's weird for Etra to not play where's waldo in this video
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Tch why wanting Akane when you "" have "" Yuzuriha..."
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"And the next day, akamatsu about to suicide ü§£"
1,f3Nx4djSLLU,"Hello lovely early squad!

As per usual, I would like to wish you all a wonderful weekend and day today"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia Goth sure is the new horror queen.
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"This looks scary and disturbing but because Mia Goth is in it, I am here for the movie! She is definitely one of the contenders for the title of Scream Queen!"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"MIA Goth is the definition of scream Queen
Her performance in Pearl is legendary"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia Goth should star in every horror movie
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,What this year and next year is proving: Mia Goth knows how to play unhinged in MANY WAYS and play it well
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"The intensity of actors like Skarsgard and Goth along with a madman director like Brandon Cronenberg, this movie will surely be a thrill ride. I loved Possessor !"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia goth is absolutely terrifyingly good in every film she touches & Alexander is always a pleasure to look at I'll definitely watch this movie for both of them.
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia Goth is a phenomenal actress and absolutely gorgeous
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Brandon Cronenberg is a really good director, eventhough he hasn't reach the heights of his father's skills, I think he has a unique bloody vision that would've made his father proud. This is the type of horror movie that Mia Goth is perfect at. At this point, she should just star in every horror movie that's coming"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Brandon has a great touch for horror genre, it's like his father...but different!"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Looking forward to this one! Hoping they would release an uncut version of this as well.

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Looks absolutely bonkers! Brandon Cronenberg is making a name for himself! This looks promising.
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia Goth is quickly becoming one of the most promising and talented new stars of this era. She's like what Florence Pugh was when Lady Macbeth and Midsommar came out.
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Besides the massive crush I have on Mia Goth, this looks amazing."
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Very happy to see that Alexander Skarsg√•rd is starring and an executive producer in this film!
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"After watching X and Pearl, Mia Goth became one of my favourite actresses"

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"So, Mia Goth's gonna just keep on killin it, huh? Can't wait!"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Brandon Croneberg has been on the roll lately, love it"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"I really wish they wouldn‚Äôt have released this version of the trailer. The one in theaters was way more suspenseful and left you wondering. Now we know the major twist. Regardless, Mia Goth holding the gun like a crazy person sold me to see this movie."
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,i would watch any movie Alex Skarsgard is in ..one talented man  and so handsome
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Daora heim? Vai ser um film√£o
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"*""Opportunities don't happen, you create them.""* __Chris Grosser"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,This had an NC-17 at first. I NEED the uncut version.
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Mia Goth and Florence Pugh have to be the two breakout actresses of 2022, both of them have had fucking amazing years."
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Brandon making his dad proud. Can't wait for this.

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Mia goth is really underrated
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,If it‚Äôs as good as possessor I‚Äôm in. Hopefully
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,mia goth has now solidified my pre-existing belief that she‚Äôd make a great harley quinn in matt reeves batman films alongside barry keoghan. that part where she‚Äôs holding the gun at the end of the trailer whilst laughing maniacally? cmon
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"I'm Ready To See It 
Also I Want To See Maxxxine

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,1:08 is the exact same location of the lab in Rob Zombie's The Munsters. Caught me off guard haha
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Do you think this is connected to the character he played in Atlanta in season 3
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"I like how I thought I knew what was going on and Brandon Cronenberg just threw me out of a car to say ""think again"". The man is definitely the son of his great father (whose Crimes of the Future was a great return to form)"
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,I am here for Mia Goth

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,I fucking love Brandon Cronenberg
1,PVnIMvVEkrA,"Little touches of the Possessor trailer music in this one, too"

1,PVnIMvVEkrA,Will wait for the NC-17 cut.
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Grew up during the 90s Pokemon craze. Briefly was living with a cousin and their mother was anti-Pokemon cause Jesus and it made me further appreciate my mom for looking at all the screaming of ""SATAN!"" and going ""Nah, she's having fun"".

I still have my cards and some are valuable but I'd never sell them despite really needing it because she bought them for me. Still remember her liking to watch me excitedly open packs and explain which cards were which. We had our issues but my hobbies and what I enjoyed were not one of them, I miss that basic level of acceptance and wish all kids could have it."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"As a person whose first special interest was Pokemon and also as a person who was raised in the evangelical Christian trenches, what can I say other than that I am Ready for this video"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Big shout out to my mom. My cousins were, but not anymore, part of an evangelical church that made them wear skirts and I remember my aunt being like, ‚Äúyou let him watch Pok√©mon? but it‚Äôs so violent. they kill each other!‚Äù and my mom said, ‚Äúwell, there‚Äôs a nurse and she heals them and I don‚Äôt think they actually die‚Äù. Lol so I love that my mom actually somehow picked up the bare minimum from what she must‚Äôve heard while I played the VHS tapes."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"This video was super amusing and a good romp through childhood. My own mom almost fell for the Pok√©-Satanic Panic for a brief bit, but my sister and I basically had a sit-down with her like ‚ÄúMom they sing about friendship and the fighting is basically boxing. It‚Äôs fine, Trust Us.‚Äù and she was over it pretty quickly, thankfully.

Didn‚Äôt quite get away with DragonBall Z characters losing limbs, but ah well. You win some, you lose some. :‚Äô)"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"The weird thing is that since latin America went through somewhat of an anime Renaissance during the day, my dad would watch the shows with me when anime began to become popularized in the US. My best memories are watching pokemon on Saturdays and dragonball-dragonballz after school with my dad. It was nearly every day that we had our time together and it's so special to me.

My mom almost got freaked out about pokemon but then my dad and I looked at her and were like, ""it's fiction."""
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"As someone who was a small child obsessed with pokemon, and then had to put her beloved pokedex book and pikachu tshirt in the bin because it was 'evil' thank you for this video. Not even bible belt American here, we had this in Britain!? I am literally addressing this in therapy right now... hugs to everyone in the same boat <3"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I've always wondered what it would have been like if Shin Megami Tensei was the successful game of that timeframe. I'm sure it would have been way more wild
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I‚Äôm glad Hazel is looking at another niche franchise
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"If I had a nickel for every time my home state showed up in a Hazel video in an evangelical Christian, puritanical sense, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. (In a purely slash j way, I promise Colorado isn't an Evangelical hellhole. This video's been a joy, the Pokemon Panic is a time in history that's deeply interesting to me. Great work as always!)"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"As you lightly touched on at the end of the section about Phil Arms' book: there's a lot that goes in behind the scenes in christian fundamentalist families, especially in the South, that's just very troubling and sad. With the resurgence of Christian Nationalism, I'm concerned this will only get worse. Even the Satanic Panic is coming back again in full force. To any one reading this who had to suffer through a rough upbringing, religious or otherwise, my heart goes out to you. I wish you all the courage and strength to find help, heal, and break the cycle."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I used to live under my grandmother's house and while my parents were fine with me playing video games of all kind, my grandmother would frequently lecture me on how my games and other hobbies were the work of the devil and that my brother and I were being brought to the side of evil. All I had on my Gameboy Advanced though was Pok√©mon, Rayman and Castlevania and Castlevania is literally about using bibles and crosses and holy water to fight demons, so I really don't get where she was coming from on that one."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"BOY DOES THIS TAKE ME BACK.

I had all my Pok√©mon stuff taken away in middle school (just before Gold and Silver came out stateside) because my grades were constantly so terrible. Joke's on my parents though: I actually had ADHD and I immediately found something else to fixate on."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"One thing I love about pokemon, and something I feel like drives these evalgelical types away is that it fosters a lot of empathy towards creatures that are considered frightening or othered. No matter what a pokemon looks like, whether it be cute and fluffy like a mareep or more insect-like and bizzare like an araquanid, they're all seen as being capable of being appreciated and loved by people, and the player is ENCOURAGED to do so by the games mechanics straight up making high friendship with your team incredibly overpowered. You can see how an insular group who's pathologically afraid of anything ""impure"" or ""unholy"" would have no time for a franchise that's built on the principal of beauty and worth being utterly subjective and not prescribed by an authority. Like, my adoration of creatures like snakes, spiders and bats was first encouraged by pokemon forcing me to look at those sorts of creatues and seeing a potential friend and not something to be reviled and shunned.

TLDR; Pokemon is thematically centered around empathy for ""the other"" and evangalism fundamentally cannot have true empathy for anything not ""pure""."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"This week's been tough for me, but a hazel upload on a friday night made it all better <3"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I feel bad for the people who went through this as kids seriously hope you guys are doing alright.
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Man, I'm almost at 30, and it's nutty to think I've been into Pokemon since before I learned to write my name.

I'll probably still be doing nuzlockes and speedruns years into the future. Something about it just keeps pulling me back."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I‚Äôve talked to multiple people about this and, Pok√©mon taught a lot of us how to read, or at least helped us learn a LOT faster. (Reading is required to play the game, everyone is playing the game, better learn quick! Etc‚Ä¶)"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I love how he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúPOKEMANS IS MAKING KIDS VIOLENT‚Äù and then is like ‚Äúa pastor chopped up a pikachu with a sword in front of a crowd of children‚Äù
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Aaaah, the Pokemania. I was a kid in middle school and made a buck by selling floppy discs containing the gameboy emulator alongside one of the Pokemon games available at the time (blue, red and later yellow).
Used the money to buy a pack containing 2 dragon ball VHS and a backpack."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,God what a fucking experience. I love this shit. Great job mining thru what i can only imagine as the darkest evangelical hell for all these absurd takes. I really appreciate it. and if i had money i‚Äôd love to become a patron. You‚Äôre  consistently super dope.
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I think my first interaction with american evangelical Christianity from over the pond was when when my mam asked whether he friend was right in hearing that Pok√©mon was satanic, and everyone else in our church was like ""...no?""

Despite having grown up in a Christian household, American Evangelicalism still feels more alien than any other denomination or even religion."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,This is EXACTLY what I needed to keep my funky little brain stimulated. Praise be hazel for another banger üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"It is so weird to me, as a a Christian who grew up in a conservative house hold, to watch this video and have first hand experience on this subject‚Ä¶ most of my early childhood was my parents desperately making sure I didn‚Äôt interact with ‚ÄúPokymans‚Äù This was an amazing video please keep up the good work"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"My moms old boss when I was a kid was a no magic, no Pok√©mon, no American Dragon Jake Long type and it always struck me as exceedingly odd. Like his daughters couldn‚Äôt watch any of that but Narnia was chill bc THAT magical fantasy is coincidentally a Christ allegory"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Hazel is one of the best YouTubers ever, and you can't make me think otherwise, probably my favorite"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I was in middle school when Pokemon came out and it exploded overnight. Everyone and their dog had Pokemon cards and the little handheld grow your own Pikachu toys. I played Pokemon Red and Blue on the PC via emulator almost every day after school and it got to the point where I memorized every single Pokemon and their transformation. Eventually the school banned bringing the cards + toys in because people were stealing stuff left-and-right.

When I logged on the internet (AOL back then) I used to roleplay in chat rooms as my own Pokemon. Also, I know its alt + 138 for the √® ... still have that memorized after over 20 years. I saw the Pokemon movie in the theater. By the time I was in high school though the fad was dead for me.

I still have my original generation 1 Pokemon cards in my closet."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Man it's wild being reminded of this time. I will say that my experience during the pokemania in a Catholic private school was very different from the Vatican's take on the series. Shit even used to get into arguments with my 3rd grade teacher, sister Cabrini, about that.

She hated the pope and thought the Vatican was getting soft though. Growing up Mussolini will do that to someone I guess... still didn't have to tear up my mono black deck when you were going on your Magic the Gathering crusade tho!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"This reminded me of my catholic friend from middle school whose parents wouldn't let her read a book if the description called the villain ""diabolical"" or own the ""evil"" characters of a fantasy toy line. I used to smuggle my twilight books to her. We drifted apart but I hope she's doing well."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"10/10 music choices all around. Also ""Pokemon Industrial Complex"" is an amazing phrase. I'm definitely gonna be using that one."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I was raised catholic and thankfully my parents never really cared about moral panics like this. I'm glad you made this more than just ""haha crazy religious evil man"" and addressed what causes people to stoop to reactionary guff such as this."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I remember even as a kid finding it really funny that Pokemon was the target of a whole demonic scare while multiple climaxes of Digimon Adventure involved a digimon that was a literal devil at different power levels (his strongest form being unleashed when the time represented the number of the beast)
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,one day growing up my parents sat me and my siblings down to watch a televangalist tell us that pokemon was the work of the devil and that the demons portrayed on the cards would attempt to take control of our spirits; scared the shit out of me
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Even being raised Christian, I'm thankful my parents were never like this and promoted independent thinking and questioning dogma. My heart breaks for Phil's son. Poor kid just wanted his father's approval!

Also, Catholicism is pretty solid overall when it comes to Pok√©mon. In 2013, Pope Francis reaffirmed this by giving the series his blessing."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"When i was growing up i was ""banned"" from pokemon because at the time my parents were really into a local Christian community and all the kids were ""banned"" from xyz popular things they didnt like. But i was secretly obsessed with pokemon, i used to hide in a storm drain with the neighbours kid and he would let me play red on his gameboy. My favourite pokemon was ponyta and since i wasn't allowed to watch it myself he taped the anime episode with the ponyta races for me. So what im getting at here is the power of kids who like pokemon can be stronger than the will of parents who dont."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I am a Christian and theology is a big interest of mine, and televangelist fundamentalist types have ruined my own religion for myself sometimes, so we, as a whole, should always bully them"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Bro Pokemon is the reason why I became such a nerd and wanted to read books. Even as a kid I was super sweaty (or rather really attached to my Pokemon and wanting to know them better) so when Ruby and Sapphire  had natures I had to look up the big words like ""impetuous"" and ""impish"". Then in 4th grade I was the youngest kid to read a fastest reader award in my city."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,Maybe the cards that Phil blowtorched would have been worth enough now for the therapy those kids were going to need as adults; great video as always
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I grew up and am still a Christian. My mom, who fell into the skepticism, decided to buy a game boy and a copy of Pok√©mon blue (I had red) and play it herself. She actually ended up falling in love with the game and we traded Pok√©mon and stuff. It is like one my fondest memories of my mom."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Look, there's no tasteful way to say this: every time the notion of seduction was brought up, I kept thinking of Pokemon Rule 34. hazel bringing up her memories of a clergyman ashamedly bringing up Internet pornography only made it worse.

On a more wholesome note, that Catholic reviewer reading the first Pokemon movie as a parable about peace winning out over belligerence was a nice palette cleanser after 40 minutes of bullshit, though I'll also shout out the Ultimate Pokemom for keeping that taste out of my mouth for a few moments."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Yeah, my entire childhood revolved around butting heads with these types in some form or another. Pokemon as a craze was my first real forray into dealing with the lunatic strain of  evangelicals, though, and middle school aged me, fresh off the release of Red and Blue, just was not prepared to deal with that. It completely and totally ruined my relationship with half of my family for over a decade, which became FAR worse in my highschool years when I discovered Dungeons and Dragons around the time when 3.5 was really getting big. 

That being said, I am not at all ashamed to admit that to this day, I have a DEEP distrust for these people, and I'll never let my guard down around them. When I was in highschool, my friend group formed an after school get together group where we took advantage of an empty classroom to play our D&D after school once a week. One of the parents found out about it, and not only did they take it to the school district to break it up on the grounds of being 'satan worship', they literally beat their own son so badly that he came to school the next week with half of his face swollen black and blue, badly screwed up ribs, and was totally banned from associating with any of us. Of course, the school was told that he had simply 'been in an accident' and it was left at that, but we all knew the truth, and it was confirmed to us a couple years later when we were all old enough to tell our parents to fuck off legally if we wanted.

From my experience where I grew up, this wasn't really even that rare among those people. I've several other examples of seeing this kind of behavior first hand, and have heard many stories of it second hand, and I don't even live in the bible belt, I live in fucking Michigan. 

The silver lining for me personally is that my mom simply didn't care, and my father was both never home and a catholic, so I didn't have to deal with that madness directly. Now, as an adult, I keep these people at a distance from my persona life, and they're a big part of the reason I live in an armed household."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Last video I left a sincere but kinda nitpicky comment about the use of ""in the west"" and ""English speaking word"" interchangeably in few instances and I have to say I really appreciate the way you were very precise in your wording for this video. Maybe very few people will care or notice but it makes a huge difference. Also great research work as usual! I had no idea about the Italian bishops position about Pok√©mon and I'm Italian myself."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"please continue making youtube videos, these are genuinely enriching. i have learned more from you than i earned in my middle school english class."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"OH MY GOD

This unlocked a memory, because I recognize that 2nd book as one my grandma had. I remember distinctly the ""Dodrio pokegod"" thing!!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I remember I was waiting for the bus one time when some drunk dude asked me what was on the back of my jacket (it was a pokeball) and after I told him his eyes lit up and he said that he knew it was a demonic symbol and that he also knew about Pokemon being a ploy by some shady organization to get childrens blood since witches apprantly love chowin down on childrens blood. He then insisted that it wasn't a bad thing that I liked pokemon as long as I knew what the background was and sat awkwardly across from me on the bus.
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I didn't expect to hear the phrase ""Blasting Rope"" in this video, or possibly my life. Not unhappy about it though.

Glad to see the video as always!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,Every Hazel deep dive is a rabbit hole I'm never prepared to go down
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,15:56 You are doing hard hitting work.  it's not easy to make a video about a masterpiece anime as thought provoking as the videos you make about 'bad' anime are.
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,My dad fucked up a lot but I'm glad he loved video games. So much so that he would even borrow my GBA for business trips and brag about all the progress he made in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. ü•∞
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I have a relevant story as someone who grew up in a deeply Christian environment during this time!

I was in first grade when Pokemon came out. Naturally, me and all of my friends started playing. My parents were a bit skeptical of it, due to how invested me and my friends had gotten with it. The fact that I could tell what Pokemon came out by its sound, or that I could tell my friends how to fight a Pokemon just by hearing them talk over the phone about it, these things were a bit weird to my parents, but they didn't stop me from playing it (surprisingly I think).

The big change happened in second grade. I went to a Christian school at the time, so anything that affected one person religiously affected us all in some way. Someone at the school got a chain letter email. Email was still new and chain letters were constantly circulating and the religious crowd was especially susceptible. All it took was one pastor taking the bait and forwarding it to his church email list and, since it came from The Pastor, it wouldn't be questioned much, and never openly. When it reached my school, it was already pastor-approved and had the same effect as it would on a church.

The letter told a story. A group of missionaries had gone to Africa to witness to an unnamed ""tribe"" and brought a bunch of toys with them for the kids. The toys were just generally basic shit that kids were playing with in America, and apparently Pokemon cards as well. I'm 99% sure it was definitely the cards, not toys or plushies, but the cards. You know, those things that your supposedly non-English speaking children wouldn't be able to fucking read? But hey, missionaries are dumb so... Anyway, when the kids got the cards, the people in the village started freaking out. They were identifying the pokemon as the demons from their pre-Christian religion. The letter urged parents to keep Pokemon away from their kids because Pokemon were demons, and a surprising number of parents at the school did.

My mom let me decide on my own. She figured it was only a game and even though she had some misgivings, I don't think she fully bought the story in the letter and figured there's nothing wrong as long as it stays fantasy and I'm not acting weird with it. My best friend, however, ended up fully rejecting Pokemon. Because of him, I also rejected Pokemon. My mom was proud of me for rejecting Pokemon as ""evil"" just on the principle that I was rejecting ""evil."" Tbh, I could absolutely believe the story about the kid smashing his game with a hammer (though it was definitely embellished). That shit happens in hyper-religious environments.

I didn't play Pokemon again until Soul Silver had already been out for a while. Missed out on a lot of fun times, but I've made up for it and gone back to all of the Pokemon I missed out on."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"OH BOY, I knew exactly what this video was going to be about the moment I saw its title and thumbnail. I have first-hand experience with this whole phenomenon, having attended a Pentecostal church when I was a child, back during the 90's Pok√©mon craze. The funny thing is, it didn't even come up UNTIL I (and I think my step-brother, too?) brought some cards to Sunday school one day. THE VERY NEXT WEEK, there was suddenly a flier pinned up on the church bulletin board, talking about how evil and satanic Pok√©mon was.

When we got home my brother and I had to get rid of all our Pok√©mon stuff, and I didn't get back into the series until FireRed and LeafGreen came out --  long after our family stopped attending church (and I became an atheist).

Though I'm not 100% certain, part of me is convinced that flier was only put up to stop us from bringing our Pok√©mon cards to church again."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"The sentence ""literally named squirtle"" has opened my eyes to how much LGBT propaganda we are subjected to unknowingly. Thank you Hazel for spreading the lords word! 

More seriously: Fun video, thank you for endangering your sanity by reading these unhinged religious texts and sharing it."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I had to throw out all of my Pok√©mon merch when I was in first grade because of this nonsense üôÑ I never met anyone else whose parents thought Pok√©mon stood for ‚Äúpocket demons‚Äù and was satanic. For most of my life I thought it was just my mom and grandma being weird because this wasn‚Äôt out of character. Fortunately, they forgot about it and three years later I was able to grow up with the games, even saw the movie in theaters. I‚Äôm grateful for that. 

Thanks for picking this topic. I‚Äôm curious to learn more about the satanic Pok√©mon scare."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Me watching the majority of this video: ""Wow, I grew up in a Christian household *in the bible belt* during the height of Pokemania and I don't personally remember any of the misguided fear or overbearing prudishness. In fact my parents were wholly supportive of my early admiration for both Pokemon and Harry Potter, even buying me the original 1st edition base set unprompted. Maybe things were different for me because we were Catholic?""

Me @40:43 : ""AYYYYYY TOTALLY VINDICATED""

Another banger video Hazel. I know I can always count on you for high quality fascinating content which more often than not appeals to my personal tastes. Honestly your style is impeccable; keep up the good work (no pressure tho). You are sincerely appreciated."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"If Phil doesn't like stories where characters are pictured (or told about) being blown to pieces, poisoned, maimed, butchered, or killed with bloody fury he probably wouldn't like kids reading the bible"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I grew up with secular Jewish parents so I never had anyone tell me I couldn't like Pokemon even in Hebrew preschool, but later on I did have a weird Evangelical babysitter that wouldn't let me play Pokemen or literally anything with magic in it, but I just hid it from her, lmao. It was still kinda traumatizing being told that Satan was out to get me (for... playing Pokemon) at such a young age, though and trying to convert a child you're looking after is really damn scummy."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"As someone who has had their special interest as Pok√©mon since it first hit the west... but also have lived my whole life in the UK, when I found out about the whole ""Pok√©mon is of the devil!"" stuff, it was perplexing. Also really cool to see you talking about Pok√©mon stuff!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I remember when I was a child in 2001 a guy actually coming to my school and doing a presentation saying among other things that Pok√©mon was evil or whatever. It was quite remarkable, as it was the moment I realized supposedly respectable adults could be f***ing morons."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"31:21 ‚ÄúYeah, because the Bible‚Äôs boring as shit, and Pok√©mon is cool and fun.‚Äù This is my favorite line lmao. I hated when our Youth group leaders gave us shit for not being super passionate about the Bible lol"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,My mom and I used to go to a Pentecostal church when I was a kid and during a Sunday school the teacher told me that I could not watch or play Pok√©mon anymore because it was Satan‚Äôs way to get to children and they were evil spirits inside the poke balls or something. I told my mom later i never wanted to go back and she‚Äôs a huge Christian but even she thought that was dumb hahah. I never went back afterwards ever again. That‚Äôs a quick way to push people away from your religion. And it‚Äôs funny to think that they freaked out this badly about the censored and edited version we got in America
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I bought one of Phil Arms' DVDs as a gag gift for a friend a couple years ago. Two weeks went by without so much as a peep from him regarding whether he shipped my order, or even whether my order was received. Long story short, I never got the DVD, and it is, to this day, the only purchase I've ever had to escalate to a dispute with PayPal. Not very Christlike, Phil."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I'm glad my Christian parents were smart enough to not fall for this bullshit and let me just be a kid. I didn't grow up during Pokemania, but I remember hearing about Christian parents making their kids burn their Harry Potter books and just being horrified. They were not so chill when I wanted to stop going to church because I hated it and had no friends and it was just making me miserable honestly. Still I'll take my Ws where I can get them."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,Pokemon literally taught me how to read. I got obsessed with the games and also a book on the first 151 pokemon. So I guess the demonic powers were very useful for me!
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,I wasn‚Äôt allowed to play Pok√©mon or with Yugi-oh cards as a kid. My siblings and I basically started an underground card/game trading system in our home and with kids from other Pentecostal households. They basically made us ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù and liars for nothing
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I remember my folks not allowing me to play Pok√©mon for so long because of my christian upbringing. It wasn't until I went into a gamestop myself and bought a PMD game with my own money that they just had to relent, probably helps I was a teen at the time too. I am still sad I never got to grow up with the series, or yu-gi-oh, or other collection-based games. It made trying to bond with other kids a lot harder. But at least I can enjoy it now!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"My Evangelist mom forbade me from reading Harry Potter cuz she feared it was ""Satanic"" and led me to the occult, but was ok with Pokemon in the house.

Let me say that backfired on her cuz  Pokemon led me to wanna learn about the occult, lol."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"My mother bought into a ton of the fearmongering over pokemon and whatever fad was going on through the 90's and early 2,000's, but she still let my brother and I have our fun with everything pokemon (which does surprise me seeing as she burned all of our Harry Potter books). Pretty grateful for that, because we still connect over it to this day."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Crazy to think these same arguments have been functional for over two decades now; I personally do not remember a society were ""geek interests"" didn't face some form of backlash. It's definitely receded a bit now that some aspects of Nerd Culture‚Ñ¢ have entered the mainstream. No matter how present they are right now (which varies depending on your geographical location), some of its effects still linger in the collective consciousness of conservative-adjacent adults.
It took me quite a while to unlearn all these toxic ideals. As damaging as they were to my development, it's always refreshing to look back on them and see them for the bullshit they are.

Great job hazel, I adore your content and your delicate but thorough approach to every topic you cover. Keep it up!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I know this topic looks and is very funny in hindsight, but I actually have a pretty painful history with it. When I was six years old I went to a Christian ""private school"" in Florida while all of this was going on. I say ""private school"" in quotes because it was just a glorified daycare center the church my dad worked at ran that taught preschool through the first grade... It was not a good start to my educational career. Anyway, I was a kid who loved Pokemon in an environment surrounded by adults who all thought Pokemon was demonic. Let's just say the result of that was the single worst, and possibly most traumatizing year of my life, the effects of which followed me well into adulthood and more or less set me up to struggle with school for the rest of my time in it. Like, the adults were laughing when they heard their kids tried to poison me and that I was regularly crying during school. To my parents credit, they never made me stop playing Pokemon despite all the hate they got for it and they did eventually pull me out of the school and send me back to public schools despite being dead set against public schools at the time. I guess adults encouraging their kids to treat their son like a monster was less appealing than me being taught about evolution; who'd of thunk? It's nice to be able to look back now and laugh at how crazy this whole thing was when at the time it did me a lot of very real damage that I'm honestly not sure I'm ever gonna be able to completely work through. So seriously, thanks for this. It's genuinely a helpful look back for me. üòä"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Damn. This reminded me of my childhood. I love Pok√©mon and had saved my money to buy a shit ton of Pok√©mon cards with my allowance money to play with the old kids in school. My ex step dad convinced my mother that it‚Äôs Satanic and that she would be a bad mother if she let it continue. She threw out my Pok√©mon cards one day, telling me the same thing. He also went on a rant about witchcraft and voodoo, saying that we are good Christians and we don‚Äôt like those devil worshipers. (There was also an anti Haitian speech and how they deserved it)

That made my mother rethink the marriage because she has a Haitian child.

She doesn‚Äôt like talking about her militant Christian phase cuz she was embarrassed about. Still is wary about Pok√©mon tho for whatever reason.


She‚Äôs a fan of Harry Potter and Stranger things tho. More than I am. It‚Äôs funny as fuck"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"""What my relationship to God and also Pikachu should be"" is an absolute whiplash of a statement"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I never got to have a Game Boy, so the extent of my relationship with Pokemon around that time was watching the anime when it aired and deciding that Ash was lame and that Team Rocket totally should win and get his yellow spark mouse. I stopped watching when I realized that that would never happen because protagonist power. My relatives were on the... devoted side, but to them, at least, this was just a cartoon with colorful monsters, just like Harry Potter was a book about wizards (that being said, HP books were so very much forbidden when spotted in school)."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Absolutely, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING sound design and soundtrack directing. The music choices over each segment is perfect."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Oh man, this video takes me back. One set of my grandparents fell into the ""Pokemon is satanic"" line of thought. Weirdly enough, they were catholic

My parents didn't care though. They got my siblings and I VHS tapes of the anime and some of the games."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"‚ÄúTHIS POK√âMON IS LITERALLY NAMED SQUIRT-LE‚Äù SHUT THE FRONT DOOR OH MY GOD XD

I think my mom was happy about me drawing Pok√©mon like Jigglypuff and Pikachu because she and I would show them off to my doctors and her coworkers ;w;   Very lucky our Judeo-Christian neighborhood and Irish Catholic family didn‚Äôt care a whit about the ‚Äòsatanic panic‚Äô angle on this stuff.
Great video as always!!"

1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"best video ive seen on ""pokemania"" in quite some time. I really appreciate all the footage you pulled to make this. it really brings me back. I wish younger pokemon fans could experience the mania."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"your comment on always checking cited sources reminded me of when I was in catholic high school and was assigned to write a one page response to a pro-abstinence booklet called ""pure womanhood"" (dont worry, they had ""pure manhood"" for the boys too <3... bleh) for religion class. instead i wrote a 10 page paper ripping into the book, in particular meticulously debunking all of its ""cited"" sources - which repeatedly lead back to 1) the same author/the author's spouse, 2) a priest who would put out non-peer reviewed papers that provided the cited statistics, 3) literally not a real source in at least one case! to my religion teacher's ""credit"" she did give me a good grade for the assignment because I actually bothered to engage w/ the text. 

on a related note... if anyone ever wants see the extremes of where the christain ""internet p-rn addiction"" panic has gone... watch the movie firerpoof :) i watched this for abstinence class in middle school!

ANYWAY!!!!! watching this video brought back a lot of memories i now try my best to laugh at. thanks for the interesting video, hazel!!!!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"i wasnt there for the initial poke panic but i watched countless youtube videos on it circa early 2010 (it felt like it was a really prevalent topic for a while)
 
back then i didnt think much of it, the usual haha dumb christians getting mad over kids games but as i got older and more aware of my status as asian i started to wonder if there were some... racially charged incentives to making pokemon (a japanese game) out to be dangerous, but brushed it off as being kinda paranoid of me. but when you talked about the bad faith reading of the pokemon anime opening's lyrics and the book being weird toward eastern religion i couldnt help but feel a bit validated for those feelings haha"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"That was the absolute best possible way you could've ended this video. Thank you for the video, I'm always excited for more."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"you're concerned about Phil's kid being unsupervised with a hammer, but when _I_ was nine years old and visiting my grandparents in upstate NY, I'd take my grandpa's hatchets and try to get them to stick into trees when I threw them, and I turned out fine. uh. I think. also oooh, The Chariot shoutout, very nice"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,Pokemon is so big that there's bound to be mindless legions foaming at the mouth when you mention the name. It's funny how nothing has really changed

1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Wow, this was an amazing video essay! So well articulated ü•∞"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"So about him saying that the PC crowd is anti Christian it's kinda true but honestly (and while I am a man of faith I am not as strict with my faith as my parents were to me or my grandparents were to my parents)
The fact is they kinda brought it on to themselves they came in with an iron fist and a tight grip with one hand and a bible and a belt with another. I know this is gonna sound cheesy but to quote princess Leia ""the tighter your grip gets the more systems will slip through your fingers"" and I feel the tighter boomer parents and gen xers were during the 2000s and 90s is what led to the mostly non religious/ anti evangelical dogma we see now.
Btw my mom used to buy me Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and other anime stuff a ton when was a kid much to the scorn of my grandmother who's very religious even more so than my mother (my grandma unironically reads Jack T chick tracks)
So I grew up hearing Pokemon and stuff was evil, then as I got older my parents pettled the anime was Satan rhetoric.
Lol I did not mean to go on a tangent guess just relieving a ton of trauma and arguments and headaches this satanic panic brought my childhood"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"This thing was obviously a scam ; two decades later and i'm still waiting for my sweet, promised, demonic powers to kick in... What a rip-off."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Oh my goodness, this hits home so hard. I went to a Christian school and I still vividly remember a guy printing out a website saying that Pok√©mon was satanic to get it banned from my school."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Great video, but the bit about Catholics is only partially true to my lived experience. 

I live in Poland, and anti-Pokemon sentiment was very much alive and well here; I vividly remember how our religion teacher (yes, we had and children still have 2h a week religion class that you're required to go to unless your parents ""write you off"" the attendance) telling us how ""a kid"" that for sure existed visited our parish priest and gave him all his pokemon tazo discs saying he should take it from him ""because those Pok√©mons destroy my life"". 

My mum was not religious, she isn't even baptized, so she was mostly cool about me being interested in Pok√©mons as I was already very interested in animals and nature, so it was kind of confusing having interacted with those stuff at home and knowing they're harmless and then having it demonized at school.

Only after the Pope's official stance was made public the bitching about Pok√©mon at churches stopped. But they were somewhat pass√© at that time already. 

All the wrath transferred to Harry Potter.

Tl;dr, Catholics hated Pok√©mons, too."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"As someone who grew up in the 90s, I'd love to see you do a general Pokemania episode! Good video."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I'm so glad I got into Pokemon after the Satanic Panic. At that time, I was into Bionicle, and even at the beginning the lore was too dummy thicc for parents to call out as corrupting.

That, and let's just say culturally, I'm from the side of America that's historically been seen as evil for existing, so, what more could a Asian cartoon do?"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,MORE HAZEL LETS GO THANK YOU
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"Evangelicals: PIKACHU IS THE DEVIL
Secular critics: Pokemon is encouraging consumerism
Concerned Parents: this is all encouraging gambling 
Catholics: Ash is Jesus actually and that is incredibly based
Japanese Critics: its kind of bad to call it ""evolution"""
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"At 11:24, the text on the page mentions that Digimon is a counterpart for an even younger audience and I absolutely need to speak up about this as a Digimon fan. For one thing, Digimon is really not a counterpart to Pokemon in anything but the most surface level- They're both multimedia franchises involving monsters that evolve, and that is the end of their similarities. But the bigger thing is claiming that it's for a younger audience is just... Demonstrably untrue. The Digimon games being released at the time, the Digimon World games, were getting T ratings by the ESRB. Its anime was pretty kid-friendly, but it went places Pokemon never dared to- There were major character deaths in Digimon that the English dub rarely censored. This book probably came out before the third season of Digimon did, but said season has a girl's Digimon partner die, causing her to go into such a deep depression that an eldritch abomination looking to understand humanity comes to the conclusion that all humans just want to have their existence deleted to eliminate their own suffering. I don't like comparing the two franchises to each other because as I said, they're not related in any meaningful way. But if we were to compare them, Digimon is the edgy one that pushes boundaries, not Pokemon."
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"You know, I feel like I mentioned this in another video on a similar topic (though, didn't dive NEARLY as deep as this one did.)
But, imagine if Giratina was made around this time.... Or, if these types of people caught wind of it during the Pokemon GO era.

It was banished by Arceus (AKA God, which in of itself would FREAK these people out alone, since you can CATCH GOD) from Heaven for being violent.... Has 6 legs, 6 spikes, and 6 points on its wings (or 6 wings in Origin Form.) And this is cemented even further In Legends Arceus. It wanted to take revenge on Arceus, along with a human who was a pretty boy with blond hair, and an angelic vibe.

""ER MAH GERD! IT'S THE DEBIL!!1!"""
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,My wife hates when I watch video game essays but when it's a Hazel vid she is immediately hooked. Thx from both of us <3
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"I wasn't allowed to say ""evolve"" when the Pokemon fear mongering was big. Pokemon changed in my parents' household. üò§
I wasn't allowed to bring it anywhere near my grandparents however"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,Incredibly based Hazel came out to play in this one. Good work!
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,"such a great vid, always a treat, incredible plosives!"
1,JdBLtEoZRRc,thank you for this video. the children of satanic panic thank you for this. the lack of pokemon and harry potter in my childhood made me feel so weird and now I know who to blame lol
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Watch episode 9 here! got.cr/cc-msgtwfm9
1,maWaJEYO-xM,The best part of this entire duel was that headshot. Never underestimate your opponent. This was a true rising underdog moment.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Obviously, the clip of her mother shedding a tear is a bit concerning considering Prospera's ulterior motives, but I also felt like they were partially genuine considering her daughter just activated the ability to beat the tech that killed her husband. This show is really good at playing with my emotions „Ö†„Ö†"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"I‚Äôve heard some people call this show slow and boring‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve honestly enjoyed getting to know more about the cast and see their ambitions. At this point I really don‚Äôt know how things are going to play out and *that* is definitely keeping me on the very edge of my seat each week.

For some reason I‚Äôve grown a soft spot for Guel. Really hoping he has the chance to shut his father up. üò§"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Doesn‚Äôt matter how many times they play this OST,I‚Äôll get hyped EVERY. SINGLE. TIME."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Honestly the inevitable ""Antidote Canceller"" was something I was thinking would happen since well... the Prologue shows the Aerial Gundam's predecessor face the Antidote system. Why wouldn't Lady Prospera build something into the next version that would counter the Antidote system's use?

That system led to friends and family to getting killed. Seeing something you make counter it would bring a tear to your eye... as now you have made something to counter it. Defeat it."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,As soon as those drums kicked off it was over. Suletta went ‚ÄúCall an ambulance but not for me!‚Äù
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"I love this battle.  It's just perfectly encapsulates the difference between Suletta and her opponents, and not just in mobile suits.  You can feel her determination shine through and reflected in her piloting.  Girl is a straight beast of a pilot."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Love how everytime she shoots or slices the antenna off, the bits come in behind her to shred the mobile suit"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Probably the best battle theme to date. When this song kicks in, the show is SLAPPING"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"The fact that she almost got beat but it took an entire team of these people astounds me. I really hope she doesn‚Äôt go undefeated till the end of the show. Other than that the characters and music in this show are great. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Shaddiq and Miorine, I hope they explore that more."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Suletta zooming around like a crazed ninja on crack decapitating mobile suits while joyfully talking to the voice(s) in her head is just the right mixture of badass and unsettling.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Suletta+Aerial sure is one absolute unit. But winning the duel with teamwork at the end is satisfying.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"whenever the ""witch from mercury"" OST soundtrack starts playing i know i'm in for a good time"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Possibly the best headshot in the history of Gundam, and Gundam has had a couple of really excellent ones..."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,This series has an uncanny ability to hook you on a cliff hanger on one episode and give you the pay off you're looking for right after and not an episode longer.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Her:having fun smiling acting like a game 
Them: panicking fighting for their lives"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I GET THE CHILLS EVERY TIME THEY PLAY THIS SONG
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"She also had a handicap to losing some parts before getting serious too, imagine if both arms were still placed she might not have need the support at the end."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"According to the short story they released, Suletta has been piloting Ariel for most of her life. You spend that much time with one machine and you learn it in a way no one else can. I don't think there is another pilot at that school that can touch her in piloting experience. She has flown actual life and death missions and she is fighting against students who only know duels."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Every other episode really adds to the idea thay Suletta is probably gonna get her mind broken at some point
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"This track goes so hard every single time they play it ‚Äì I'll never tire of it. They just added it to music streaming platforms yesterday, FINALLY! Until now I'd just been constantly rewatching all the other duel clips lol.

The score, animation and VA are all so good in this show, it really makes moments like this hit. Gundam was always that one franchise that eluded me, but I'm definitely gonna go back and try some of the other ones like IBO and 00 once TWFM is over. If they're even 1% as fun as this has been, I'm all in on Gundam."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,This is like some kind of New Type of combat...
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Totally unexpected ending! Bravo!
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I can't wait for the moment when something happens and Suletta goes full balistic
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Man, we as the viewers know that Aerial is a sentient machine but think about it from the perspective of the other characters. Miorine questioning why Suletta was speaking to her mech as if it was actually responding must have creeped her out. Same for the girl calling her a freak when Suletta was moving around ninja style while speaking to herself. It added a bit of eeriness to the otherwise grandiose feeling of the fight"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"It‚Äôs still just a fraction, my guess is full power will be absolute victory on the battlefield ü§©"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Suletta getting a fin funnel barrier this early seems super cheap lol
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Deseoso del siguiente capitul√≥! üéâ
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"I know this was supposed to be a powerful moment for Suletta, but the fact that she kept talking to Aerial makes it kind of unsettling thinking about what is possibly to come from this."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Its funny how the bits went for a overkill by destroying the limbs even though those mobile suits were already defeated once their heads were destroyed.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Looks like after this battle Aerial is either gonna get a serious upgrade or get repaired.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Whelp I'm officially more terrified of Suletta than Mikazuki.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"When those first six notes play... You know the can of whoopass has been opened.

Enemies of the Aerial beware."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I have to say witch is pretty good so far and some of these scenes I would say rival the final scenes of Iron blooded orphans
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Don‚Äôt know weather to be happy or sad for Suletta not getting the ACE.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I'm just contemplating the costs of this school... because those are highly experimental multimillion-dollar Hitech prototypes that children can drive to near-complete destruction at those duels...
1,maWaJEYO-xM,They seem to have it in for absolutely tearing suits apart this season. Like I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been one fight with the Aerial that didn‚Äôt end in complete dismemberment. I‚Äôm super here for it tho
1,maWaJEYO-xM,When that music plays you know the Ariel Gundam is about to go full beast mode on the other Mobile Suits.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Best moment of the show
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Ah how touching to see the ""sisters"" bond going even deeper.

I'm sure nothing bad can EVER happen to them.

Just ask Mikazuki with his ""bond"" to his Gundam."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,It‚Äôs been 20 years since the raid. I can‚Äôt help but laugh that they thought the jamming signal would still work
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I like how they played the fact that earth house had a team of engineers and that got them the win.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Bro srsly, give the guy who makes the title a raise!"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Please give whoever come up with the title a raise.  üòÇ
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Lo scontro pi√π bello fino adesso. Ma non avevo fatto caso che usano armi letali in quelli che sono dei duelli scolastici. Cio√® se uno sbaglia qualcosa si ritrova una ferita non da poco. O peggio. Scommetto che vedremo un occhio volare in un duello
1,maWaJEYO-xM,If this is Suletta calm fighting... I am scared of what she is like if she is filled with anger
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Guess who has a higher ground this time.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,The pacing of this show is deceptive because we will get like 2 episodes where there is zero combat and then we get fights like this and it completely earns all the build up.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Awesome Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury Video.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,This episode was so good. The animation and voice acting were a match made in heaven. I am absolutely astonished how Sunrise can maintain such quality from the OP to ED.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,This gives me Barbatos vibes
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Goodness gracious, that soundtrack always gives me goosebumps"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,As much as I love this scene... why post a clip that kinda ruins the episode?
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"HEADSHOT!

*An ounce of sniper is worth a pound of suppression fire.  :D"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,If aerial meets barbatos would she treat him like an old man?
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"0:54 
Yes. Yes setsuna is a gundam"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,theyre gonna need an anti anti antidote
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"The hell is this? I have no clue what this anime is about but might give it a watch, the animation thooo üî•"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,It‚Äôs like Aerial went Blue Unicorn mode in that scene! üòç
1,maWaJEYO-xM,It look like someone was talking through  her when she said no its fine
1,maWaJEYO-xM,THIS SHOW IS SO DAMN GOOD
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Mikasuki estar√≠a orgulloso de la peque√±a
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Awesome.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,*BEST STUFF EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!*
1,maWaJEYO-xM,FaZe Chuchu out here with the clutch snipe
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Everybody gangsta until ""The Witch from Mercury"" starts playing"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I wish all Anime as English dubbing.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,These titles XD. Next one gonna be : Suletta and Aerial on demon time once again!
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Every clip cuts out her Fortnight stunting on him
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"I have a theory. If one normal human = 4 layers.

Then 12 bits = 36 layers"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I know this is its own universe but does that girl have new type like abilities?
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Suletta and Eri, fighting side-by-side: of course their mother is happy. It's proof of her late daughter's intelligence trapped inside the machine."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"THAT TEAR WAS FOR YOU, NADIM"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Note:
Eri's Permet markings were  blue in the prologue. Aerial's Permet markings turned blue this episode.
Yeah no Eri is totally Aerial at this point."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Should have double tapped.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"EVERYTIME THE GUNDAM keeps losing one of her arms. (Her Left Arm). 
Whenever the enemy takes off the GUNDAM Arm off, it's a Clutch Moment, A RABBITS FOOT to Win a Battle, to Survive. 
(Anyone NOTICES this too????) 
[The Prologue & Every other Duel Battle]: THE GUNDAMS LEFT ARM COMES OFF!!! 
[WINNER!] GUNDAM!!
Loose an arm & a leg. What is this Series telling us? The Symbolism & Metaphor about our limbs. Every episode someone takes their arm off their body.
Will Suletta loose her arm or leg in the future??"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"InB4 some corporate stooge changes the title of this video from ""Battle of the Killstealers"" to something lame and boring."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"What exactly is Aerial‚Äôs connection to Suletta?  Aerial is unlike any Gundam I‚Äôve ever seen before‚ÄîIs she simply an AI or something else?  Prospera, Suletta‚Äôs mom, the original Witch, who was so central to the Gundam 0 ep., her presence looms so large now and is shrouded in mystery."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,love how gundams have been evolving with the same designs. just slight tweaks.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,So smooth
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Notice when the Aerial is in normal GUND-arm mode, it glows red. Just like gundam pilots with their PERMET scores. 

But here, the Aerial glows blue, like with Ericht Samaya's PERMET in the prologue. 
And Prospera sheds a tear when she sees this.
Hmm."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"If this was real, they all be gongon.üòÖ"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Se ve chido ,
Vale la pena ?"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,So as it get better the  original gundam that they said was lost 001 will make an appearance later  hmmm
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Well, this team battle was a mistake. Suletta would‚Äôve beaten Shaddiq if it was a 1-on-1 battle."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Teamwork makes the dream work.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Ouch , someone got a headache ü§ï"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,why did she cry?
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Cut the best part, where she emote dances on him"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"0:23 - 0:43 It was Eri talking, not Suletta."
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Bruh, funnel moment #5"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,This is how a team is carried on a 1v6 lol
1,maWaJEYO-xM,I still don't trust Prospera. She'd better not get between SuleMio or we're gonna have to throw hands
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Yep the MC ended up in the same Vein as the MC of IBO S2. Can't really feel any tension in any of these fights with how hilariously out matched every one is vs Aerial.
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Another one Pshyo-frame Gundam
1,maWaJEYO-xM,Play of the Game: Chuchu
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"Wow 2d animated mechas? Amazing

Then you have big and celebrated studios like mappa, who use cgi on any complicated movement. They even use cgi for mere humans now. Embarrassing"
1,maWaJEYO-xM,"It's a cool scene, but it almost feels like they SHOULD'VE lost, so that the company, and the by extension, the GUND-Arm technology, gets hot potatoed around the factions, such that every one of them can develop their own take on how it should be implemented. Furthermore, I think it's also high time Suletta and Miorine hit their first setback, rather than moving forward all the time. One of the biggest narrative advantages Witch From Mercury has over many other Mobile Suit Gundam shows, they're not explicitly in the war setting, failure DOES NOT EQUAL DEATH, failure is NOT the end, but that's not being utilized at the moment.  
In isolation, this reads suspiciously like Bandai pushing a variant of the Aerial, just in time for Christmas."

But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign

Another evening I'll sitting reading in between your lines

Because I miss you at all the time

So, get away

Another way to feel what you didn't 
want yourself to know

And let yourself go

You know you didn't lose your self-control

Let's start at the rainbow

Turn away

Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go

Is that a compromise

So what you wanna do, 
what's your point-of-view?

There's a party soon, do you wanna go?"

1,3GVOrGSpx5E,Nice new map!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Fun fact: The ""Joe left the show"" line is, in fact, a neat little reference to the fact that Joel has left this show!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Joel's acting is incredible in this. He really looked and sounded like an actual piano.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"These guys have been doing great work, keeping the channel alive after Joel's death!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Despite Joel's untimely death, this channel is still going insaneo style"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Lots of people thought it was impractical to keep this channel going after Joel‚Äôs untimely  run in with a Soviet era landmine, but they sure look like jokers now."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I miss the good old times when Joel was with the homies, so glad they are paying tribute to him & continue his legacy"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Trent has an impeccable singing voice. He should make an album.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Once he's healthy again I'm gonna get him with the classic brick-in-a-pillowcase prank
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"This is one of my favorite live action skits on the channel. The pacing and delivery is perfect. The surreal moments give me some Alan Resnick vibes. 

Speaking of which, if Joel were still alive and I had a make a wish foundation wish, I‚Äôd wish for Joel and Alan Resnick to collaborate. That‚Äôd better than cheese wiz on a Tuesday."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"The same thing happened to me, it was really exciting! I emailed them about it later because they didn't reach out to me, and they responded in character! They were saying things like ""That wasn't us"", and ""I recommend you contact the police"". What Impractical Jokers!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I love how the friends were always just on the cusp of horror realization, but just never quite got there."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I‚Äôm not convinced Joel wasn‚Äôt the one who stabbed him. I mean think about it. Do we ever see Joel and Stabby Joker in the same room together?
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,A couple months ago Joe Gatto did a stand up show at a comedy club across the street from the bar I work at and I'd heard he was a very pleasant man to talk to. I personally have never watched the show Impractical Jokers and only slightly recognized the name Joe Gatto when people were talking about him. On the second night he was in town I saw a person in the bar wearing an Impractical Jokers shirt and with my new found knowledge of Joe Gatto being on the show Impractical Jokers I asked that person if they were planning on seeing Joe Gatto at the comedy club. I asked Joe Gatto if he was going to see himself.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The real crime was Trent's beautiful singing being interrupted.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Man, I love the camera work on this. Really takes the skit to the next level."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"As funny as this is, I'd like to take a moment to appreciate how brilliant the camera work is in this, its super disorientating and kinda scary, it really helps the spiral into madness"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I have to applaud everyone in this scene! Hilarious, and just enough dark <3"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I love the shock humor when he lifts his shirt. Like you do not expect it to be that gruesome
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I'd say I miss Joel but the channel seems fine without him so keep it coming
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,You wanna know what would have been an amazing plot twist was if he was actually on impractical jokers and the prank was pretending he thought he was on impractical jokers but he got robbed to his friends.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"It's great to see Joel's friends take over so much of the roles on his channel while Joel gets his much deserved rest...



...in peace...



...in pieces."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,it makes me extremely happy to see Trent in these collabs with the cherdleys/spence/haver crew.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Wow man, what a beautiful Rollercoaster of emotion! Spence did great fading out of existence."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"‚ÄúAlright Murr, ima need you to stab him and yell at him to give him your wallet.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOoo, that one looked like it hurt! Alright, you did great bud‚Äù
üëç"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,That's so awesome he got to be on impractical jokers.  I can't wait to see the episode.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,You're such a talented guy joel good stuff  rooting for ya!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I nearly had a panic attack with these goddamn comments talking about Joel's death. Glad to hear it's just one of those inside jokes I hear so much about.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I miss Joel. At least he's found true joy playing the big RPG in the sky. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,My favourite part about impractical jokers is when they have to reshoot scenes when its already dark and they have to turn the lights on
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I kinda already k ew what to expect going into this one but it still made me laugh so hard that I died deader than Joel rest his soul.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Congrats Spence! Can't wait to see your episode
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Me and my dad went to the supermarket like 5 mins away from our house because we had a family friend that worked there that told us they were gonna film there. We saw Joe and Sal walking around between turns and Joe started following us but when I turned around he just started walking the complete opposite way like he knew that we knew him.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Me when the Jokers are impractical.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,R.I.P. Benny Harvey he probably is keeping Joel in good company  also R.I.P.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Joel can‚Äôt be dead, he was just in a movie.  He‚Äôs a feature film actor now, and that stuff takes lots of time."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Wow, an experience to die for!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Guy was so traumatized he created a whole narrative in which he wasn't dying, which prevented him from seeking medical help. This is the darkest Joel Haver I've ever seen."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"""Was it Saul?""

I think Saul stabbed him because he was upset his friends picked Sal over him for the show."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Damn, can't believe I was watching Kevin film Chris skating and now he's here with Joel."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I think you guys are way off on this one. 

This absolutely sounds like a Murr bit, maybe even him being put up to a punishment, especially with the prosthetics. 

Can't wait for the episode to air."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I love how Joel just has Charlie's Peepo from the streamer awards.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Wow that was really good makeup I am flabbergasted that the impractical joker guys have the budget for that kinda effects
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The camera person had a LOT of fun with this one!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I was kinda hoping for his phone to ring for them to tell him that he was on practical jokers.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Hiring a bunch of actors to scream and panic in the background was a nice touch.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Ever since Joel died his friends have been leading such fulfilling lives. Makes you think.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I was thinking ""wow, those are some very realistic practical effects"" and waited for someone to laugh and break character at the end and for the dude to get up. But no, he's actually dead. That's some REAL dedication to the bit, and I respect that"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,id like to think that all of will just drop like flies one by one started with joe lmao
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Wow that‚Äôs awesome, congrats!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,This is some WWG-level comedy! Youbube NEEDS more of this!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,This is really good ü§£
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I get it now! Joel must‚Äôve been on impractical jokers! They sure got him good with that land mine! I bet it took hours for the police to pick up the remains üòÇ. Jokes on them!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Dude, I just saw this Impractical Jokers episode on TV.  This guy was hilarious, and he played it so cool that you didn't even realize he was in on the joke."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,hopefully Joel will get released soon.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Who else thought that after the knife wound reveal that the three guys were gonna be replaced by Sal, Murr, and Q? Because I sure didn't. No way they have the budget for that."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I have been looking forward to this.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,You deserve an acting role fr
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The impractical jokers once rear ended my car and totaled it. I was so excited to be on the show! Once they drove away from the scene I knew it was the impractical jokers going around hitting people with their cars just for the fun of it! Can't wait for the episode to come out
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The idea of trying to show your friends a classical song you learned on piano and one of them just keeps trying to sing along with it is beautiful
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I‚Äôm disappointed this came up in my feed because I love Impractical Jokers. IMO I would call this straight up click bait and a waste of my time.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I was in the same episode! Those jokes are so intense I‚Äôm still in hospital recuperating. Can‚Äôt wait to see it air
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I'm dying üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,You just know Joel is smiling down on us right now as we enjoy his posthumous releases.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Guys, where is Joel? Surely you guys have been working on some Necromancy training?"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Can't wait to see this on Impractical Jokers. Sounds like it was hilarious!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,whoever directed this is a great director ... .... whoever
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,At least he was considerate enough to pass out on the red pillow. 
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I miss Joel
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Woah the impact of meeting the cast sure knocked him out, I hope he recovers and gets to see the episode with him in it!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"This channel never ceases to surprise and amaze. Truly unique stuff, which is rare on youtube these days"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"how come nobody is talking about ""don't sing. don't sing."""
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Their faces when they realized it wasn't staged.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"First Joel, now Spencer. Who are we losing next?"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Nice video ‚ÄúJoel‚Äù we all know this is an elaborate Practical Jokers but and Sal is watching me reaction thru the hidden cameras as we speak! Nice try!!!!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I like to think Joel was the mugger in this sketch.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I was expecting the big twist to be that he actually was on impractical jokers, but Joel comes through again with the no double twist plot twist."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The MOST impractical joke
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Can‚Äôt wait to see the behind the scenes on that episode of Impractical Jokers: All Practical Effects
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I was once on Impractical Jokers and I got stabbed by them, too."
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"I was hoping for Trent to say ""I wonder when the episode comes out..."" at the end there. üòÖ"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Just like at the end of Marvel's Endgames they actually killed off Joel like they did Chris Evans so he could take a more directorial role. Such dedication to the art.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,He looks like Murr with hair üòÇ
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,First Joel.. now Spencer... pls someone send help
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,this was a banger!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,The lighting change in the middle of this took me out of it.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,theres no lyrics is a slept on line
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Every vid with Trent is amazing
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,These guys are losing friends left and right out here!!
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I loved this episode of Impractical Jokers. They've really had to kick it up a notch with Joe Gatto leaving.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Having to go to the hospital is really what makes the show so impractical.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,If you run out of daylight...don't film the separate shots with artificial lighting 1/2 way through. The continuity is lost completely. Joel wouldn't have let that happen. Sloppy! This is not how you carry on a legacy!  RIP Joel.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,RIP JOEL
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"Every day those Impractical Jokers go out on that street, impractically joking. If they didn't, who would?"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,oh man that sounds its gonna be  a real doozie to watch üòÇ the jokers have really stepped up their pranks always so funny üòÇüòÇ
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,"The same thing happened to me, it was really exciting! I emailed them about it later because they didn't reach out to me, and they responded in character! They were saying things like ""That wasn't us"", and ""I recommend you contact the police"". What Impractical Jokers!"
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Kevin's merch is next level
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I would buy that sweatshirt. I would wear that sweatshirt.
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,I hardly even miss Joel
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,Kevin's hoodie is glorious
1,Wwfb7LHTse8,RIP Joel

1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"I love how when Mingyu embraces Jaeseong, he says ""gross"" as an attempt to keep his wall up. But as soon as Mingyu confesses and he realizes they feel the same way, the jealous boyfriend jumps out. haha"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,This needs a movie. We cannot throw their chemistry just like this.
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"I'm not gonna lie. This was entirely too short and I found myself ready to throw hands when those credits started rolling. But seriously, this was better than most 12 ep BLs out there so, I enjoyed it a lot"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"When he said ""While I'm in the army, if you flirt with any other guy, you're dead to me."" I died."
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,This is one of the most down-to-earth and familiar pieces of LGBTQ media I've ever witnessed. No melodrama or jealousy just a quiet look at big feelings expressed in this understated but affecting way. A masterpiece!
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,The way their story was much better depicted than half of the bl's released so far tells a whole lot about this channels dedication. Hopefully more people support you guys cause this was too short but I loved their chemistry and plot so much. üòçüòç
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"once strongberry start producing full-length movie, it's all over for the industry"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,Strongberry's contents are masterpieces. They deserve to be in the mainstream screen.
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"This needs to become one of those ""six seasons and a movie"" show. It's so great, you've done in 7 minutes what some dramas can't do in 12 episodes... Please let this be something that gets developed further üôèüèª‚ù§"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,omg didn't expect this to be THAT good we need an extended version of this a series or a full movie cuz the storyline acting and chemistry are OUT OF THIS WORLD we need more of them
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,it's so unhealthy how many times I've come back to watch this shortfilm. the storyline their acting and the cinematography everything is just so beautiful.
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Mingyu is adorable.

Jaeseong has that indefinable ""it"" star quality. The quiet strength. The expressive eyes. The smile.

If Strongberry grows to be in a position to produce longer BL series and films for a broader audience, it will drag South Korea - and the rest of Asia - into the 21st century in their wider acceptance of the LGBTQ community ... and wouldn't the world be better off for it?

Excited to see what's next, Strongberry ... waiting and rooting for your major success!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Como que 7 minutos? Esto merece una serie de por lo menos 12 cap√≠tulos de 50 minutos cada uno! La qu√≠mica que se cargan, y lo natural que son, nooooo denme m√°s de ellos üò≠üôè"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,The way this short is better than 12-15eps BLs. Imagine what these guys can do if they‚Äôd extend it to a full on series üòç
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"The story was great. Simple yet shows reality. When mingyu knew that jaesong will go to the military, he couldn't control his thoughts and utter things that he keeps inside him.   I like the idea about mingyu watching jaesong's back while walking. It was like,""yeah I'm with this, I can hold back and just watch you from behind"". Not until he finally realizes that he shouldn't hold back anymore. Jaesong's reaction was a defense mechanism. The act of mingyu confuses him that's why he said that it was gross. But then, when mingyu finally confesses, he found assurance that the feeling is mutual. 

In some drama, this plot could take up to many episodes but it was shown here plain and simple yet not boring. I wish I could see what's next for both of them."
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"6:06 His eyes showed genuine surprise, followed by realisation with relief and happiness. I love this scene üíú"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"This is so sweet, in so many levels. It kinda reminds me the amount of courage and energy it takes to fight for whom you love. The awkwardness, the silliness, the way they look at each other and don't know how to express their feelings. So sweet. I love this. I want more!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"A hist√≥ria √© linda, e o desfecho √© t√£o natural que tornou tudo mais bonito ainda. Boas actua√ß√µes e √≥tima hist√≥ria!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Esses quase 8 minutos passaram t√£o r√°pido e foi tudo muito fofo, eu amei muito, preciso de mais üíôüò≠
.
Obrigada Joe por ter legendado üíô"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,A CHARACTER NAMED MINGYU WHO KINDA LOOKS LIKE HIM IS OUT OF THIS WORLD SKJSKJKSJ this is my favorite thing right now huhuhu they act naturally and I super love their chemistry huhuuhuh pls make this into a full series. Kudos to the makers of this!!!
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"llegu√© a esta serie tras un resumen... y me doy con la sorpresa que tambi√©n producen ChocoMilkShake 
Que preciosa historias ... me emociono en el primer episodio :)"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"It was much better than I expected ü•∫ The actors are so good, it deserves continuation"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"This popped out of nowhere in my feed, and i was like, ""Strongberry is the only one who can produce high-quality short BL though."" And it turns out, it's them."
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,This is beautiful
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,The actors are so good. The chemistry is powerful. I need a longer episode for both of them. I'm loving this! International fan here ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüáµüá≠

1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"5:54
The most simple and effective confession ever!!!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Aaaah, this was so good! The butterflies I got, the bittersweet worry in my heart as I watched, it was all so well done. The actors have wonderful chemistry together!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,I want a whole series for this one. It's too good!!!
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"this is a really cute movie! i love how natural everything felt and played out. as a viewer, it makes me feel like i'm there with them watching their love story unfold :)"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"I really loved this story. I honestly can‚Äôt believe that you were able to tell such a powerfully sweet story in under 8 minutes. I will be checking out your other works, and I‚Äôll be looking forward to any future videos that your willing to share. Best of luck.üíú"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"MDSSS caraa, uma perfei√ß√£o dessa que dura 7 minutos e 32 segundos. Coreia conte comigo pra tudo."
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"A perfect gem of a short movie . It actually was my first Asian BL, and it got me hooked to the genre."
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Yo estuve cuando este corto ten√≠a unas miles de vistas y ahora ha sobrepasado el 1M, estoy feliz por los actores y el equipo que lo dirigi√≥. Sigamos apoy√°ndolos!"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"I loved this mini drama! 
The actors are really good and the plot is super cute!

Eu adorei tanto esse mini drama!!

Que del√≠cia o di√°logo entre eles junto com a not√≠cia que iria para o ex√©rcito, muito show!

1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Que bom, que tem legenda em portugu√™s (Brasil)"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Goddamn this is so great. I mean look at their acting, emotions, expressions and chemistry. It's so real. this shouldn't be a miniseries üòëüòëüòë
They should have their own series or a movie üôÑ 
Best wishes for these two and the whole team who put their efforts on this. they deserve better."

1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"Apaixonei nesse casal e na hist√≥ria. Quero a continua√ß√£o, tem??"
1,D3ES2V0XVzw,"No crisis. No unrequited love. No third person. 
Just a beautiful short love story told in such a way that captures the viewers heart. 
I applaud the writers and the production team and the director - well done.

S'il vous pla√Æt, ne me dites pas que je suis la seule √† avoir des larmes aux yeux et pleine de nostalgie en reregardant les Toy Story et autres films d'animations qui ont tant berc√© notre enfance..."
1,81dWdeDjfC4,J‚Äôai verser ma larme.. comment vous dire que maintenant que j‚Äôai 18 ans je sens les responsabilit√©s venir et une pression monte en moi ! L‚Äô√©poque o√π je regardais Toy Story tout on long de la journ√©e devant ma petite t√©l√© me manque tellement.. cette chanson aura toujours une place sp√©ciale dans mon coeur ‚ù§Ô∏è

A peine finis qu'on demander √† ce qu'on rembobine la cassette pour relancer le film.
1,81dWdeDjfC4,"Je lis les commentaires 
C'est dingue ce sentiment et cette nostalgie qu'on partage tous √† propos de toy story 
Cette innocence √† laquelle √ßa nous renvoit, ces souvenirs de cassette VHS, ce bonheur et cette envie commune de vouloir le transmettre √† nos enfants pour que eux aussi puissent connaitre cette insouciance et ce bonheur"

Pour moi la vie ce n'√©tait que du jeu, du rire, de l'amour, et rien de plus! Et un jour on se rends compte qu'on est adulte, qu'on as des responsabilit√©, et que le monde n'est pas aussi simple ni aussi joyeux qu'on le pensait. C'est triste, mais √ßa me donne envie de ch√©rir encore plus mes souvenir, et j'ai h√¢te de transmettre ce bonheur √† mes enfants!"

Quand tout s'embrouille, 
En vadrouille,
Loin, tr√®s loin de ton lit douillet;
Rappelle toi d'c'que ton vieux pote disait :
Oui je suis ton ami,
Oui je suis ton ami...
Y'a peut-√™tre plus malin, 
Que moi ailleurs,
Plus fort, plus puissant aussi...
Mais je suis sur
Que personne n't'aimeras
Comme je le fais,
Toi et moi et...
Plus les ann√©es passes,
Plus on est solidaires :
C'est peut √™tre √ßa notre destin√©e !
En tout cas crois moi,
Je suis toujours l√†
Car je suis ton ami."

Meme aujourd'hui de mes 34ans je les reregarde toujours avec grand plaisir et surtout la fin de toy story 4 quand buzz et woody se dise au revoir me fait toujours verser une petite larme. Je pense que meme en devenant adulte on garde toujours une part d enfant en nous qui nous rend nostalgique des moments pass√©s avec nos jouets, bien que comme Andy en grandissant on les laisse de cot√© et un jour on a envie de les donner a quelqu'un d'autre. C'est sur qu on ne peut pas garder tous les jouets de notre enfance, mais en garder quelques uns est tout a fait possible, surtout si ils continuent d'avoir une valeur sentimentale a nos yeux et nous rememore nos bons souvenirs d enfance"

1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Andy, this is so cool!!
Glad you found all the cards! (Still sad that you had to pay so much)"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"After seeing your garbage pail kids videos I started collecting some! There‚Äôs a store near me that sells a bunch of old trading cards, and they have this huge box of garbage pail kids cards! They‚Äôre all opened already, but that‚Äôs ok. I only have about 20 though because they‚Äôre really expensive for $1 per card!! Anyways, I was super excited for this video and you also inspired me to create my very first flipbooks! You are awesome man"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,My guy Andy is just having fun with life. Take notes world.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"I was a schoolteacher; I remember all the pearl-clutching over those Garbage Pail cards.  People were positively howling over how awful they were!  If kids got caught with the things at school, they were confiscated.  LOL  
I have to admit that (though I couldn't let on!) I found most of the cards absolutely hysterical and subversively witty.üòù"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Oh! so sad the artwork of the 2 cards are missing, but this video is so cool and creative!! Love the ‚Äúnew‚Äù cards"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Love this!! I have been looking for GPK cards but recently it is really hard to find . Love your videos it actually inspired me to start flipbook animating !! Thanks Andy!
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Me: I refuse to watch YouTube clickbait titles!

Also me: whoa, Andy! What a wacky title! What is this rapscallion up to now!? Can't wait to watch!"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,I thought that Flip Book was illegal cause it  had something like super Gorey content or lots of NSFW content that they are selling to children but it's a Counterfeit which still bad but overall i still think it's overpriced.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Thanks! Any idea when the flip book starter kits are going to be back in stock? It's one of the main things my kids want for Christmas, and I'm hoping they'll be back in stock soon! I would much rather support you than some random seller on Amazon."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Wow, one must really love flipbooks to pay $712- to get one. On the flipside (pun intended), it's something superrare that will be treasured for sure."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"I just simply LOVE Garbage Pail Kids!
At least you got all of the cards!"
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Quero agradecer a toda divers√£o que o Canal Andymation me proporcionou no ano de 2022.

1,0RPuW-MbMHo,After the video: sir your under arrest for having a counterfeit filpbook and we have to put about 7 years in jail
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,That was one of the best sponsorships in a video I‚Äôve seen in a while.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Wow Andy never thought you would pay 700 bucks for some counterfeit cardsüòÇ‚ù§
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,You know he's dedicated when he risks going to jail for them.

1,0RPuW-MbMHo,I love your vids hop you see this. Yer the reason I make flip book.
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"Very cool video. I didn't notice any gaps when the flip book was played on video, so maybe the two missing cards/numbers are actually non-existent and the cards/sets were mis-numbered. It's great to see your family get involved."
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,Illegal? Wow ok
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,I put a pillow on the ground I hope you‚Äôre safeüòÇüòÇ
1,0RPuW-MbMHo,"enjoy your videos. they always felt like the lighter side of YouTube. but an ad about jumping out of a plane felt a little too much, and maybe a little in poor taste. i hope we don't start normalizing those kinds of jokes."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I suggest you offset your real estate and get into stocks, A recession as bad it can be, provides good buying opportunities in the markets if you‚Äôre careful and it can also create volatility giving great short time buy and sell opportunities too. This is not financial advise but get buying, cash isn‚Äôt king at all in this time!"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"With the way the market is moving, we'll mostly hold for longer than 2025 to realize profit gain, I think a video on ""How to profit from the present market"" will be more effective, I mean I've heard of people making up to 250K within few months and I'd like to know how."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Having watched the institutional investors buying family homes far above market value I have wondered what their out game would be.  Seeing banks get bailed out during the last crisis maybe they feel they own enough congressmen to get their share of the taxpayer dollar and get bailed out.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Cost of housing is way over inflated and has been for a long while.  It needs to be brought back to reasonable prices.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"You mentioned Mom and Pop investors in passing. Could they be the stabilizing element that mitigates the effects of the crash? With companies like open door dumping inventory, will mom & pop investors grab them up as rental properties? I have a nagging feeling that traditional market analysis like yours is missing something here ü§î"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Investors, particularly the larger groups, share much of the responsibility for overheating the market.  This is the catalyst for the upcoming trouble in place of bad mortgages and bank BS.  It‚Äôs not regular people speculating this time, it‚Äôs giant corporate funds/hedge funds‚Ä¶etc.

Also responsible is the Fed, for being asleep at the switch and letting the rates burn at a low rate for a full year after the covid cash infusion, when they should have been slowly raising starting in Spring 2021.

It wasn‚Äôt hard to spot this coming a long time ago."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Don't bail them out.  They must sink so others can float on their mistakes.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Be warned!  It'll depend on your local market. A little personal story:  Silicon Valley 2007, 4 bedroom 2.5 bath 1,700 sq. ft. remodeled 45 year old home in good neighborhood but busy street.  Market value $875k.  2008 Bank values it at $625k (that is a 28% single year drop) .  2010 divorce forces sale  (shocker I know).  Appraises at $650k sells for $725k (foreign buyer, in a foreign country, sight unseen).  I sit on sidelines, renting, licking my wounds.  

It'll take YEARS to recover!  Especially with the super tightened lending!  2008 was a one off - Real Estate moves S L O W.  OH SO SO WRONG.  

2012 house sells for $1.2MM - I'm F'k (with that captial F! - no way back into the market now).  2021 market value $2.4MM.  

Is this how America is supposed to work?  Is this what is best for the country? How about the families in it?  How about the fact, not only can I not afford housing, but there IS NO Way any of my three kids will be able to afford to own a home here.  Is that what society thinks is a healthy model?"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Homes were already overpriced before the pandemic. I would prefer many small crashes compared to one enormous one.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Considering interest rates on home purchases are around 7-8% coupled with $400k loans, of course people are dipping out. It‚Äôs almost impossible to afford that honestly."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Some countries have a second or third home tax, where you pay additional taxes to own more than one house. Would this alleviate the housing market a bit?"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I'm an Appraiser in MI, Foreclosures have started slowly this year, prices are coming down, Refinance business is dead. I've heard from 2 Lenders there will be a Wave of Foreclosures coming. 
Don't know when but..."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"An excellent common sense analysis.
One other thing could accelerate the decline.
Many of the institutional investors are sitting on SFRs that are not rented and produce no income.
When you can flip property in a few weeks or months and make a quick profit why bother with the hassle of renting.
Now that quick profits are no longer possible and values are declining many of these companies are sitting on property portfolios that are worth less than the next to zero interest loans that were used to buy them. There is a strong likelihood that lenders will call in or refuse to extend these loans and many of these investors will go bust. The loans wont be extended or renewed because at current rates of interest the investors have no revenues to service the borrowing.
This would result in a deluge of property coming on the market as lenders seize portfolios and dump properties in an effort to minimize their loan losses."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"In spite of commoditizing the housing inventory, prices are underpinned by the inflated replacement cost to address a growing and pent-up generational demand.
I'm not worried - but investors should be, especially in the jacked-up Sun Belt.

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Much respect on changing your position on housing. Would be curious what caused you to change your mind?  Btw Nashville prices dropped 4% in November MoM. 478K to 460K.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Institutional investors need to be prohibited from entering the residential market.
It's evil to put profit above allowing individuals to afford housing. Particularly corporate entities."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"According to reference there are 160 million dwellings and most of them have more than two bedrooms due to the fact that some people don't live in the United States there's actually only 1.7 people per dwelling. So there was never a house in crisis we simply don't have enough people to fill up all the dwellings. And I'm sure in 24 months every women woman didn't have four or five children when everybody's dying of a so-called pandemic or 50,000 people commit suicide in a year or another 100,000 die of drug overdoses brought to you by your doctors prescribing oxycodone. When you have too much of something you pour milk out in the street when you don't have enough of something you can lower the price and have it readily available since there's no one here you have to raise the price for a lack of consumers. Not because there's high demand. This is economics 101. If you have millions of customers and you can't keep up with it you'll lower the price if you don't have enough customers you have to raise the price to make up for your losses"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Whenever a large number of investors are involved is when a crash is around the corner. Crypto is the most recent example. I expect 80 percent of the US housing market will decrease by 40 to 50 percent in the best case scenario.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,well done report.  Small mom and pop investors  are waiting in the wings for the market to drop low enough to a point were a property can pay for itself (pencil out)  then the rush to buy will return.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Wow!  This was an informative and astute presentation on the housing market. I loved it! The visual aids (grafts) analysis and interpretation made sense of a complex economic sector. I liked the presenter‚Äôs voice too.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Inflation hits people a lot harder than a crashing stock or housing market as it directly affects people's cost of living that people immediately feel the impact of. It's not surprising negative market sentiment is so high now. We really need help to survive in this Economy. The fin-Market;s have underperformed the U.S. economy as fear of inflation hammers the prices of stock;s and bonds. My portfoliio of $250k is down to $192k any recommendation;s to scale up my return;s during this crash will be highly appreciated.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Investors have destroyed the housing market.  The ones who were able to cash out, did so.  Others dumped what they could and ran...."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Good. Investors should leave the market. It's sickening to see what ""investors"" have done to the housing market. Millennials can't buy a home and they made it even harder."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,It's called greed! Investors in Australia have done the same here and prevented many first home buyers from entering the property market. Hopefully next year will see young people buying some bargains!
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,As an investor myself I really don't ever see housing prices going down dramatically.Canada and Australia and other countries have it worse than us.THis is not to say I don't wish housing prices would go back down dramatically but I just don't see it happening.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,These big companies made the biggest mistake investing in real estate. Its not passive and requires maintaining. Their strategy might have worked last 10 years because anyone could have became investor last 10 years. Secondly covid caused massive inflation in realestate and so many new investors joined due to the hype and social media. These people will be in for rude awakening. I can‚Äôt wait for this drop to buy more.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"If you absolutely do not need to buy right now, then do not do it.  Be patient,  the housing market is going to continue to correct.   We aren't close to the bottom yet.  Get yourself some popcorn and watch for a while and stash that cash in the meantime."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"When the ibuyers are no longer able to manipulate prices by bidding over asking, welcome back to normal wages."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Then when prices bottom out all of the investors - big and small - will buy up as much as possible, and the cycle will go around yet again.
Until we seriously reform the unlimited, feudalistic property laws at the foundation of our perpetual, dysfunctional, inequitable, unaffordable housing crisis, not much is going to change."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Sacramento Realtor here üëãüèΩ Zillow left our market selling every home they bought, Open doors is almost out. Now, I do see us loosing 30% of the values over the next 2 years. I also see a lot of new households being formed and buyers not having to compete with investors makes for a healthier market. Our demand will keep up with the need for supply."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"House prices might start dropping and continue dropping for a long, long time.   In the next decade or so large percentages of the homes that baby boomer currently own will become available (I don't mean to be morbid, but it happens to us all in the end), and there simply aren't enough younger people alive to create the demand to buy them."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Let‚Äôs get this straight; is this video about the housing market at large or just open door? Because corporate landholders failing is great for the majority of average single families looking for a home.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Leveraged speculators die with rising rates. They made a fortune the last few years putting 15% down, making payments for a year and then selling for 30-40% more than they paid..10Xing THEIR money because most of the money used to acquire properties wasn't theirs, it was the banks. Leveraged RE investing is no different than trading on margin... and they are about the get margin called/wrecked."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"The same high-yield potential exists in both bullish and bearish situations what matters is knowing where to look. I have been diversifying into the stock sector and trading aggressive through an advisor. Away from all the distractions around I still make profits from my investments, made $260,000 so far this year."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I walked away from 2 houses and 350k in mortgages in 2008 and paid cash for an abandoned foreclosure in 2009 2 miles away. Best decision ever to be debt free and OWN a cheap house that has low taxes and utilities. Im FREE to work the hours i want since Im not buried in DEBT. Anyone can do it. Walk AWAY and save your money, find a cheap house and live below your means. Sacrificing a credit score is worth it if you cant sell a house for more than you owe.. My credit score is back to perfect once again waitng for the next housing correction."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I live in Atlanta.
I can absolutely confirm that 1 out of every 3 homes here are being purchased by investors and large investment firms."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Just to add. Price restoration 13 years without inflation. With inflation much longer.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,I totally agree.. the last crash took a few years. I bought a house in 2000‚Ä¶ in 2010 it was worth less than I paid‚Ä¶ then it tripled in value as of 2022. I sold it.

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"People are moving out of democrat run cold states as the costs skyrocket on heating, fuel, taxes, everything! And the crime rate also skyrocketting! Moving south to warmer climates and Republican run states where crime is low, property and home prices are but a fraction of their northern counterparts, restrictions are minor, and much less cold weather to compensate for, plus the ability to have your own garden to grow your own food helps keep food costs down as well. People are waking up to this fact rather quickly!"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,I bought a house in 2018 for $345k. Last week I tried to refi and it only appraised for $225k.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Speculating with housing reminds me of China's housing market implosion.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Meh, it's just a correction.  Hopefully it will make housing more affordable for families, not silly investors."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Unrealized numbers are just numbers on a screen. Until people buy at a price in masses it's just unrealized numbers on a screen. In other words none of this data matters at all. Nobody is going to buy houses until we are back down at 3-4% mortgage rates, and when that happens the houses will be WAAAAAY more expensive than they've ever been. So none of this data matters at all."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"What's happening in the housing market is eerily similar to what happened to Cisco Systems stock (CSCO) around April 1999...it became the darling of the stock market and skyrocketed, but plunged equally as fast.

While it was going up everyone thought they were investing geniuses and developed a sense of invincibility...but ran for the exits as it plunged downward."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Actually it isn't. Real estate preserves wealth during high inlation. Investors are scooping up deals. You don't have californians trying to overcharge for their house, like a million for a 1200 sq foot home.  Rents continue to increase and they should. Anyone with a job can afford $1000 rent; I started out working minimum wage had had a few room mates share a small apartment.  Why can't millenials do it? Oh yes got to pay for the oculus, 1GHz wifi and the latest phone, lol. That is why they can't afford their own college loans and utility bills that the gfovernment just paid off for them. That is why inflation is so high. That IS A LOT OF FREE MONEY going into the economy"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"The algorithms never account for what actually creates the situations that allow for people to buy homes they never could afford.
When key job loss really starts to take place, and when inflation is still painfully high for families, houses will dip further as people will lose homes."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I buy for cash flow so while I don‚Äôt want to buy at the top.. long term it doesn‚Äôt really matter. In 29 years I‚Äôll sell the house and do a 1031 Exchange into another.. cash flow is what I‚Äôm after, not appreciation."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Investors deserve what they don't understand. God bless you and your families Aloha and amen
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Very TRUE!  I purchased my house in 2007. Market finally crashed in 2010. By 2013 I was underwater by $90K. I refinanced my mortgage when interest rates were low, and I paid down my mortgage for 13 years while the market slowly recovered. I was only able to sell in 2020 when the amount I paid off on my mortgage combined with the crazy appreciation in 2020 allowed me to have enough equity to do so. Interestingly, If it wasn't for that great hyper appreciation that continued into 2020 I believe that to this day I might not have gained as much equity as I did. As the housing prices continue to decline, it's going to be a much, much slower recovery because we will never experience another hyper appreciation in real estate so quickly, so instantly like we did before. Expect a longer, slow recovery."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Great video, very informative using facts not speculationüëèüèΩ. Can you please make a video how to profit the next coupe.."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Simple math people, when interest rates go up housing goes down in price and sales"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,It's a good thing. I get fewer call wanting me to sell my father's house or mine. Maybe my property taxes will come back down. Doubtful.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Investors are only 20%  max.  80%+ are people who live in the house.

We can agree this is a highly manipulated market by the FED.  Housing is not the only industry that benefited from cheap credit.

To fix housing, we will need to regulate to offset what the housing market lobbyists have done to create this insanity.

Get investors out of the low end of the housing market.  I would support giving live-in buyers a 6 month window to bid on a house before any investors are allowed to bid.  If they sell in less than 3 years, unless an emergency, they will be penalized the amount of their gross profit on the sale.

simple!  
This would force down rental prices as more live-in buyers would be eligible to purchase.  
Get half the homeless who don't want to be on the streets off the streets.  
It can be done in months.  Investors will jump ship if you take the profit motive out of it."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,I think you might have your cause and effect mixed up. Did the investors cause the bubble? Or did the bubble bring in the investors?
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I tried to warn people in 2021 that we were in the process of entering a housing crisis, that we were at the tippy top of a housing bubble. Nobody would give me the time of day... Well now you are all on your own. Let the bubble burst so I can pick up a bunch of houses for mere pennies on the prepandemic dollars. Crash and burn baby! Burn baby burn! I don't care that the house I live in is worth 90% less because it is paid off and I'll be able to buy a million dollar home for 100k. Let's go, I'm ready!"
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Good video. Excellent analysis üëç

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I got a call a couple days ago from a lady working for Berkshire Hathaway asking me if I was interested in buying a home or a condo at Kure Beach, NC, which I stay a few miles from. I busted out laughing at her. She replied, 'sounds like you're in the same business I'm in'. If Berkshire Hathaway are calling little ol' me to offload real estate, the market is absolutely tanking."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,I live in a Phoenix suburb. My home value peaked at $820K in Feb. 2022. It's now valued at around $690K. My home is up for sale if anyone is interested. Just reply to this post.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Right now, the wisest thing for everyone to do is to invest in non-government sources of income. Especially given the current global economic crisis. This is still a fantastic time to invest in stocks and digital currencies."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,I would only buy have home if I had cash for 100% down payment.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,5:28 gotta give you credit.  thats a good datapoint thank you.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"So, another ""Great correction"" is coming? I hope I got good enough credit score when that come."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Real Investors are not ""leaving"" real estate. They are simply not buying right now due to prices/rates. The math won't work so they're waiting. The premise of the video is wrong."

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,black stone and star wood only allow their client to withdraw 2% of their money from REITS a month

1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Investment fell because borrowing costs are high. It increased rapidly because rates were dirt cheap so everybody was borrowing.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"Its funny to think that ""housing"" is essentially 2x4 box's ."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Imagine honestly believing houses will go down 70%. You‚Äôd have people working part time at McDonald‚Äôs buying houses in cash lol
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,This info falls under DUH! We've seen this all before.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Nomad Nation - everybody's going to live in their cars and garden sheds to piss them off.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,There is no decline in Minnesota. I see sellers holding their price. Starter homes at $270k range fly off the market within days.
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,"I don't think panicking about the investment companies makes sense.  A whole lot of individual owners made more money selling to investors, and a bunch more individual owners are getting deals as the investors bail out of the market.  All the $$ the investment companies are going to lose buying high and selling low are going mostly into the pockets of homeowners who sold high or who will be buying low.  This is a welcome case of big money, 'sophisticated' investors LOSING out to the little guys and gals.  The right reaction I think is to point, laugh, and relax."
1,rlDG0_7GuAM,Here's to hoping they collectively lose their asses on this play.

1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Hank keeps up with internet trends. That's interesting.
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,You can tell he just didn't know wtf was happening when he read out nikocado avocados name
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,the goofy ahhhh yearly griddy compitition in Ohio had me dying XD
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,This is like if an alien learned English by reading yt comments
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Oh man I hope dean still has some sanity left
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Hank hasn't been the same since all those minerals.
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,"Guys, Dean has had enough üò≠üò≠"
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,I swear to my life Hank is the best guy in the world
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,we are so blessed to have this laughter oh jah
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,This is the moment when Hank entered the goofy ahh yearly griddy competition in Ohio
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,‚ÄúYou SUSSY GUSSY‚Äù best part in my opinion.
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,When you‚Äôre teacher listens to the class socialize and tries to be cool
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,"For a minuete there it sounded like he introduced himself as ""Dank"" Shrader. üíÄ"
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Looks like Hank has been puffing that old blue magic.
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,HOW WOULD JOEL FEEL THAT A MEME HE STARTED HAS BEEN UTTERED BY HANK
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,"I actually think these actors like connecting with the younger audience, and that‚Äôs why he makes these videos. Love em thoughüò≠üò≠üò≠"
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,He making a fortune on cameo ü§£
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,The Discord Mods thing followed by mug moment destroyed me from the inside out
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,His physical health declines after every request
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,This is the moment Hank officially broke bad
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Fuckin hilarious üòÇ
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,hank schriender is so modern the level of modernity between hank and jesse its a big diffrence even if jesse is younger
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,THIS IS DEFINITELY THE MOST ABSURD ONE LMFAOOOOOOOO
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,I'm really considering paying for this lol
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Bro got more bars than a jail cell
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,Hank is officially a Veteran of Gen Z.
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,"He actually said ""Dank Schrader here"" lol"
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,"Anytime he does one of these, it‚Äôs the Mr Incredible becomes uncanny meme‚Ä¶just slowly deteriorating into the world of shitposting"
1,InwQZ3qM_yE,I love it üòÇüòÇ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,It is truly unbelievable how modern this looks. Film restoration truly is an art form.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"""Is that one called 'I've Got a Feeling'""

I love George"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Only people who aren't musicians think that Ringo didn't matter. he had no idea what this was,never heard it before,had no music sheets and was playing 100% Perfectly for what the song needed."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I‚Äôm so glad that the Beatles are back together.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Paul's mastery of melody and musical theory was far beyond most of his contemporaries.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"This is really going to be a huge early Christmas present for all us Beatle fans. I can't wait for this Documentary. 
Peter Jackson your a legend!!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,This is brilliant! The initial chords rundown for I've Got a Feeling. OMG. George even asks the name of the song at the end. No words. Just absolutely brilliant. I cannot wait for the premiere!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,The Get Back project may have essentially failed but my God it‚Äôs incredible to have actual film footage of the greatest song writing team of all time in the process of writing songs. Extraordinary!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"This makes me ask: why couldn't they have had cameras when they were making all their other records, too?! I'd be willing to watch all 50 hours of this!  Can't wait to see the Beatles and their creative process in this film..."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I think the Beatles are cracking,  I mean, you can't beat them, they are out there on their own, they've got a style of their own, they are a lovely crowd, they've good quality, they sing well, and what else can I say - they are real good people!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Gigged drums for years. Staggering how cohesive these guys worked together. McCartney is ripping off chords and time signatures....and nobody says ""Why?"" Never scene anything like that. It's like they're brothers. Working on originals was always a fight with numerous guys I was with."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,How strange it is to watch The Beatles actually learning how to play a song. It's such an abstract thought when you've heard the fully formed song so many times over the years.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I've said this earlier this is like seeing friends or family you haven't seen in years. You hear the doorbell ring and there they are.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Paul : Oh please believe me
John : YES I WILL! 

Makes me smile and cry at the same time ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I just love The Beatles more than words can ever express üíöüíúüíô‚ô•Ô∏è
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I've got to say, the clarity of the film is amazing. This *looks* contemporary, and not 50 years old. Really cool to see them like this."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Hopefully Disney Plus will start uploading all the Beatles movies, the Anthologies, etc. to its platform. It would be a great way for new generations to learn about this magic."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Three of the greatest songwriters all in the same band. What a blessing. Lennon/mccartney were the greatest songwriters of all time. And George with something. The greatest love song of all time. They'll never be a better band. Not in my lifetime.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,George was rightfully asserting himself.  John and Paul treated him as session gear.  But George was actually just as talented and creative.  To be a Beatle must have been psychological torture.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I can't believe anyone would put a thumbs down on this, the restoration, the hours put in editing and a very candid look at the beatles and all together and the trials a d happy moments make this absolutely golden, I can't wait to see the full documentary and oh to see every single piece of footage eh.."

1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"An amazing band and music , ‚ÄòThe Beatles‚Äô will always be World Icons."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,This is beautiful. The Beatles inspired a lot of Musicians and People in General.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"For true and new fans of the Beatles, this series will be a welcome rebuttal to the dark and dingy ""Let it Be "" documentary. It is astonishing to see the level of interest in these young men fifty years on. It seems that each new generation is attracted to the Beatles and their music."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,The Beatles are without a doubt the best rock and roll band everüëçüòÄ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Definitely looking forward to this! The Beatles are awesome.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"When people think Ringo can't play it's cause they don't know what a drummer following everyone else sounds like, this clip shows it"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"These guys had such a creative, synergistic chemistry‚Ä¶ amazing."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Paul gato, gato, gato, gato. Estou at√© chorando agora. Meu Deus! Todos fofos ensaiando, clima descontra√≠dos, eram muitos amigos. Beatles amo de paix√£o. N√£o √© da minha √©poca mas amo eles eram excelentes juntos. N√£o tem como n√£o am√°-los."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,An endless depth of unimaginable talent!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Que venha em DVD  (  Blu Ray )    estou  esperando o  lan√ßamento pra comprar e aumentar a minha cole√ß√£o, tudo sobre os Beatles."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,That was epic to watch ü§© I can't wait to see this documentary ‚ù§
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I love how these clips, just seeing them develop songs that we know the final result of. It‚Äôs so cool."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Only 28 years old but a HUGE FAN of The Beatles. Cannot wait to watch this multiple times lol. I own a few of their movies on VHS but this is such a treat. Feels like this was just filmed.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I love John Lennon's expressive voice.  It's  a lifelong nostalgia that we all will only hear his beloved voice on recordings. And I love Paul McCartney'ssoulfull fills.  ......could
Remind me of Brownie Terry and Sonny McGee, the difference being Macca's voice IS the ""whoopin'nhollerin'..."""
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Looks and sounds perfect. Brilliantly done Mr Jackson üëçüèªüá¨üáß the Beatles are the greatest band in the world.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Watching this kind of makes me sad that we'll likely soon lose Paul and Ringo. Paul is probably one of my favorite musicians of all time. May this music live on!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Que demais!!!!! Beatles 4 ever!!!! Coool !!!!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I'm curious how Yoko's presence made them feel, or how it impacted their sessions together. It's not a matter of good or bad, it was fate & the result, well, just listen to the albums. Or look at their legacy today (and forever really). She was an ingredient to all of this & in my personal opinion this was some of the best work The Beatles ever did. That's a hard thing to say really because everything they did, all their music is great. Great isn't even the right word!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Musicians collaborating in the most simple form‚Ä¶.. in the rehearsal room. Priceless
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I so wish I existed at that time so I could have watched The Beatles live in action. All of them must be of my grandfather‚Äôs age but I connect with their music so much, it feels as if they are my buddies. Love you till eternity, The Beatles! 
P.S. A huge, huge thank you to the people involved in this restoration and putting it out. You guys have no idea what you have done."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Paul es un genio. Fue el que sostuvo a la banda los dos √∫ltimos a√±os
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Incredible. McCartney was so creative, what a band and what fantastic music."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,N√£o sabem a alegria que me deu ver o momento da cria√ß√£o. sem palavras .
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Can't wait for the DVD to come out !
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I hope someone documented the making of the band on the run album. Paul is a musical blessing üôå.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Peter Jackson out here preserving history for future generations.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Pure class! But I can see how Paul calling out the key changes to astute music types might have grated!üòÇ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Love it! This looks like it was recorded recently ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Paul's voice sounds better here than on the final cut. I love the falsetto he goes in to to sing the chrous line.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"¬°¬°¬°Brav√≠simo!!!

1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I still think that sharp tone ""I've got a feeling"" should be in the record, only once, it will make a good difference"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I could watch this stuff all day! And the look of the film! Oh my  o my!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Their focus on each other is beautiful. I love pre-smartphone hangout footage. üíõ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,This is gonna make my folks so happy seeing old footage they‚Äôve been waiting for a long time .
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Such a gift for all Beatles fans !
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Won't be long before this generation want to know what magic of the Beatles their music never sounds old powerful music
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Very impressed that Ringo knew what to do having never even hearing this before.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I¬¥ve got a feeling that these guys will be famous soon :)
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I love how George and Ringo just watch Paul and John. Like wow.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,My favorite song from their last album; wonderful
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"George is one of thoes guys that when he speaks u honestly can't tell if he's being tough in cheek or not, even in a completely innocent question such as  ""is that one called I've got a feeling?"""
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"I recommend listening to it with headphones, the sound is spectacular."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Absolutely amazing
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Paul ruled everything at this point in the band
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Just awesome! üíñ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Some people would love to see a historical event such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence or a famous battle. Some would like to see video of an individual who was gone long before video was possible. I want to see this!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Takes me back to my teenage yearsüòçüòçüòç‚úÖ‚úÖ
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Temazo!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I'm amazed how well Yoko Ono play the plant so well.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Outstanding  footage the colour and sound can not wait for this
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,George was a very grumpy person  I get how he felt unappreciated but he should have realized why. Paul and John were always the leaders and were actually better song writers for the majority of the time. George eventually became an awesome composer but the other two were the greatest ever so he shouldn‚Äôt have felt so bad.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,George just there putting in additional color and doing his thing. I love him.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,One of the last times (if not THE last time) Paul is seen using his first Hofner bass before it was stolen!! The straight writing down the headstock gives it away!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I love that song üéµ üòç
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Those who thumbs down this video don't appreciate the gift of music.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,So psyched for this.  Thanks for doing this Disney!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"0:20 Paul: ""Oh please believe me"", John: ""Yes I will!"""
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I really love this song
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Just perfectly wonderful.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,The best band ever!!!!!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,This is gonna be great! Definitely Oscar worthy for documentation movie
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I hope this is a 4k/ blu ray release!! A MUST HAVE.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"It's been a few years since I last checked, but at that time The Beatles had sold over one billion albums....that's 1,000,000,000...and still going.
Let that sink in."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,THE BEATLES FOREVER! LONG LIVE THE BEATLES!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Most bands after number of years release a greatest hits album, for the Beatles they release an album of their songs that reached number 1."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"These ""blokes"" have a lot of potential to make it to the TOP of the POPPERMOST!!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Magical Mystery Tour is my favorite Beatles Album. Absolutely fantastic Album. There's no such thing as the Beatles best album, only your favorite!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,This gave me goosebumps
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Ringo is soooo smooth! Best drummer of all time!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Anyone interested in the Beatles recording processes should listen to Anthology 2 and 3. (3 is the best if you love the white album) 

The early takes and demo are often the best ones in my opinion!"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,love love it!!!!!
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Wow üò¢ üò≠ stunning to see that I'm speechless the coming together of I've got a feeling omg
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Even my love for the Beatles won‚Äôt make me give Disney my money.
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,Just finished this series today. Puts a brand new perspective on this
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Can you 'imagine' the greatest band in history creating new material, and having your girlfriend sit in on the process?"
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,"Wow 2021 i will be able to watch this?? I have listen to this guys for so long and i thought I have seen it All... My relationship with The Beatles and life is getting better thanks to this, i wish I can say more but is hard to describe what i feel right now, well in one word is HAPPINESS... Thank you John, Paul, George and Ringo love you forever..."
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,The Beatles I got a feeling classic song from them good stuff
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,People forget how hilarous the beatles were
1,3S4PYfwuMQs,I hope they get their stuff together.  Could be a good band with enough practice.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Check out what else is new on HBO Max here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSduohp5OGX4LfgHLn8SC-Cn5r3xXxSZD
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Most of us already know how this story ends, so it's gonna be up to this two actors and their chemistry to make us care for them like it's our first time experiencing this journey."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I cannot even use words to describe how excited I am for this show. January can not come any faster.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I was never so excited about any new movie or series than this one.
Having goose bumbs all over after seeing the trailer. Since HBO is behind it, totally sure, this will be a masterpiece."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker and ESPECIALLY Ashley Johnson more than anyone is the heart of tlou. I really hope they get their due in the tv show. I had my heart set on Ashley playing an older Ellie in part 2 just like the game but i guess im cool with her playing her mom, hopefully she gets a lot of screen time and story"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,1:43 just that one little line from Henry is perfection. They really nailed the game on seemingly every level from everything shown so far. This show will be a massive success
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"The game itself already has a touching story, beside playing it can be way more immersive than any live adaptation can give. Watching this is like taking a back seat. What more can it possibly add to an already great game?"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"just over here crying. tlou is such a personal, important series for me, and this looks absolutely stunning. i cannot wait to watch this over and over again!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,The game in its first 15 minutes moved me greatly. I hope this show has the ability to move its audience as the game di. Hella excited!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,All it's going to take is for one show to totally nail a game adaptation and the flood gates are going to open.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Pedro Pascal has a talent playing characters with tough exteriors who are trying to transport children across long distances slowly starting to love that child like his own despite seeing them merely as cargo at the beginning of the journey.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,it's not about the ending it's about the journey. Thoroughly looking forward to it.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Viejas memorias vienen a mi con este trailer, siento la misma emoci√≥n que cuando apenas sali√≥ el juego, estamos viejos compa√±eros...ser√° un placer revivir esta historia como la primera vez üò≠üíú"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Just seeing the brothers makes me emotional, I had to take a break from the game after that storyline. Such good storytelling and gameplay!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I got chills on how accurate some of the locations were compared to the game, especially from when ""Take On Me"" started playing. I actually shed a tear haha. Really looking forward to this show"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,As Gamers we already know the story‚Ä¶ we just want to feel it. I hope the actors make us feel the chemistry better Joel and Ellie. I am so excited.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Hard to watch this without getting emotional, knowing what happens to all of them.  Visually it's so accurate to the game, everything is gonna hit ten times harder.  Hyped for this!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I'm so excited to see Ellie vs David. That was such a big part for me because it showed how Joel was Ellie's safe place. I just hope the actors don't bomb this üò≠
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"""When you have played the best game 
You expect the best series""

Don't let us down üôè"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,If they keep the father daughter relationship Joel and Ellie has this show will be absolutely amazing
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This show looks like it has great potential to be astoundingly amazing. That rendition of ""Take On Me"" was beautifully haunting and gave me goose bumps. I am very excited for this to say the least.

That being said, I think the success of the show will depend largely on how well Pedro and Bella can nail the complex, evolving chemistry of Joel and Ellie's relationship. I think Pedro is a perfect fit for the role. However, and this may be an unpopular opinion, I have some reservations about Bella as Ellie. My first impression is that she seems to lack the ""pizzazz"" and quirkiness of Ellie as depicted in the video game. Nonetheless, I do remain cautiously optimistic that she will pull it off somehow. Fingers crossed."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Most of us already know how this story ends, so it's gonna be up to this two actors and their chemistry to make us care for them like it's our first time experiencing this journey."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Man I remember when I waited almost 2 years for the last of us to come out on PS3 ‚Ä¶ probably one of the best games so far in this century‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt get into gaming anymore but will definitely watch this series.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"If they get Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship right, the show will be a huge success"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Pedro Pascal has a talent playing characters with tough exteriors who are trying to transport children across long distances slowly starting to love that child like his own despite seeing them merely as cargo at the beginning of the journey.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Never played the game, and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs about or how it ends or anything. But this looks great!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"It has the potential to become my favorite TV series and one of the most famous and seen in history, although the cast doesn't drive me crazy, especially Ellie, let's hope that the story, the fights and the visual impact make up for this mistake."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"if the first 10 min start just like the game, I am going to be bawling. That opening scene got me everytime."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,this is a certified playstation classic
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When Henry said ‚ÄúYou may not be her father, but your someone‚Äôs.‚Äù üò¢ I‚Äôm not emotionally prepared for the Henry and Sam story arc."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This show hinges on the bond between Joel and Ellie. I hope they‚Äôve nailed it üôèüèº
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I dreamed of this, when I finished the game. I finished the game, a week after release.
It was the best.... Game... I've ever played. Story wise."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I'm getting such goosebumps watching this!!! My favorite game, looks like you really did it justice, thank you!!!
<3"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This is absolutely unreal. Can't wait for this show to come out. Ashley as Ellie's mom, Troy as one of David's men is perfect."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks sooooooo good. Great casting by the look of the trailer. I can't wait!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I remember seeing the people film this where I live, even had a chat with them over my love for this game. Glad to finally see finished."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When I first played Last of Us, I fell in love with it. This was everything you wanted in a game, so much so that I watched the cinematics as much as I played the game. Two people struggling in a vicious world that threatened to end their lives at any given moment.
This could be one of the biggest things to happen to a tv series. I just pray that they direct it properly."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Okay, I played this game multiple times. And while I don't have huge expectations when this was announced a few years ago, this trailer changed things. Casting aside, they got the atmosphere right, because this trailer gave me goosebump, and I hope it translates to the whole series."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Knowing it's coming from the guys who made the Chernobyl mini-series, I have good faith, Pedro Pascal is phenomenal. The bad thing is how many times this show will make me cry if done properly. TLOU was one of the first games that I really got connected to, one of the best games of all time IMO. Lets not mess it up!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Looks like their sticking close to the story...I love it
1,uLtkt8BonwM,With the storyline they‚Äôre working with this has the potential of being one of the best zombie series ever‚Ä¶.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I can't wait!!! I've been eager to watch this series since the rumours came out they were making a series. It looks amazing and faithful to the game! The visuals are are also spectacular and the atmosphere of the game is there, I'm loving this so far!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I think it‚Äôs incredibly interesting that we‚Äôve slowing started to adopt a lower standard of filmmaking as the new normal. Like this show might very well be quite good. And the cast looks amazing. So why am I not blown away by atmosphere and tension? Because they‚Äôre forgetting how to do that. The games were incredibly atmospheric with a real sense of the world. Now, much like with The Rings Of Power, we have a premium high end TV show that looks like the a mid budget network show with commercials. And that‚Äôs what they want us to pay 15 bucks a months for. And I wanna make it clear that it‚Äôs not just the studios/streamers. This is just as much the filmmakers fault for not trying anymore. Beautifully crafted stories through motion are still possible, you just have to be able to see why it‚Äôs important to put in the work."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Seeing the two brothers that Joel and ellie meet broke my heart, I'm not ready for that again"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"If they're gonna play at some point in the story the main theme from the game, Im gonna start cry instantly."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I can't get this trailer out of my head just eagerly waiting for jan 15
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Damn I'm so hyped for this. Hope this is as good as the game if someone hasn't played the game i will highly recommend playing it it's in my top 5 games of all time.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This looks phenomenal and true to the game, cant wait"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I hope people don't write this off as ""just another apocalypse show"" because the Last of Us really is one of the best stories told in a game, that I've encountered. If they stick as closely as possible to the source material, this is going to be special."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,It‚Äôs Joel‚Äôs fate to die. It‚Äôs going to happen sooner or later. I know everyone out there hate The Last of Us Part ll. I love the casting. This is going to be my younger brother‚Äôs first time watching Bella Ramsey on our favorite series. He has not watched ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù. He wants to see how Bella Ramsey act and he only knows about Pedro Pascal‚Äôs acting because he probably saw him ‚ÄúMandalorian‚Äù.  I did told him about Bella Ramsey‚Äôs acting on ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù is really good.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I ain‚Äôt gonna say that this is gonna be a good show
In fact I predict that I will always like the game 10x more
But just the fact that this is getting its own stand alone tv show is something of itself 
So congrats ND"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This game made me feel things i didn't know i was capable of feeling.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"it's just like the game, looks like every single character that we have come across is here!! the visuals look stunning, the bloater looks picture perfect, seems promising so far. I just hope this won't be a misleading trailer. it feels surreal to see that this actually exists now after so many years of contemplate."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Troy Baker (Joel in the game)as one of David‚Äôs men and Ashley Johnson (Ellie in the game) as Ellie‚Äôs mom, so glad they‚Äôre getting a time to shine in the show too!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I love that they seem to have kept the core of the plot (which is important!) while also adding more personalized human encounters. Kind of like more in-between during the journey we experienced in the game. As long as it makes sense and still goes its proper course, creative liberties is fine. Mostly because the story is about humans surviving. So adding characters that don't take away from the main plot point and Journey is fine."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I‚Äôm extremely curious what they do with this. Most of us interested in the show know how both games end so will they flip the script and go down a different route or stay true to the games? Based on the trailer it seems they‚Äôll be following the games but how closely will they follow them? Either way they‚Äôre going to be under careful watch because this is not the title to mess around with, everyone will be expecting a top tier show because of how spectacular the games were."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I like how I can watch these scenes and have a pretty good idea what part of the story they‚Äôre adapting. Looking very promising.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I am so excited to see a live action video game adaptation that appears to actually follow the story and portray the characters accurately!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Wow! If I had a nickel for every time Pedro Pascal took on a role where he first sees a child as nothing but cargo but then grows to love as a father, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Visually, this looks excellent and very true to the game but what its gonna come down to is if the actor and actress get the chemistry right. I really hope both of them took the time to play or at least watch the entire game to channel Joel and Elle. Im very excited about this and have high hopes!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I am so pumped for this. My dad and I absolutely love The Last of Us!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,A lot of gamers are going to watch this and we will be completely honest about the series. So far it looks legit.  Top five game of all time.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Haven't played the game but looks great! Chernobyl was amazing, can't wait for this!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I honestly had low expectations for this at first, but this looks REALLY good. Also I like how they're putting their own twist with additional dialouge and scenes while staying faithful to the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I can't say how much I loved the games. And I cant wait to watch this.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellies sarcasm, joels indifference, the clickers, a bloater, traversing rooftops with boards, Tommy being there for his brother, etc... It's just like the game."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I've been disappointed by many Live action adaptation, when it comes to video games. But this series looks promising. Definitely looking forward to giving this one a chance"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I've watched this trailer 5 times. I absolutely cannot wait for this show
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"The mall lighting up, Riley and Ellie taking a picture, Sam hugging his brother, Bill meeting his partner, Ellie and Joel hugging!!!!! 
This show is going to tear us apart!!!üò≠‚ù§üòÑ
BEYOND EXCITED!!!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This can be one of the greatest adaptations in tv if this is done right I can‚Äôt wait
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I love that Take On Me is in this trailer. Reminded me of Ellie‚Äôs version in TLOU2 ‚ù§
1,uLtkt8BonwM,One of the top zombie apocalypses games come to life! When your lost in the darkness. Look for the light. Believe in the fireflies.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I'm super jacked for this! I get the feeling they worked hard to recreate the magic of the game.  Stunning!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This is all going to depend on how well HBO does with Joel and Ellie's relationship building, though I must say as someone very skeptical of movies/shows these days this does actually look like they are trying to do the game justice and that has me excited."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks outstanding!! And I never played the video games either
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Slightly scared because shows like this don't always come out well but im willing to watch it because I love the game and it genuinely looks good.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I hope this offers a little something new and not just recreating the cutscenes from the game exactly down to the positions of characters
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This looks amazing I can't wait for this to come out watching it day one ü•≥
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"I hope this will make people realize what an experience and how generation defining the game was. I hope this game makes people respect videogames as art and recognize that some games have better stories than movies. This is one of them.


Thank you everyone at Naughty Dog ."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,i have never been more excited for a show to release. i cant wait üò≠
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"She might not look like Ellie, but I‚Äôll be damned if she doesn‚Äôt feel like Ellie. Really inspired casting decision."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This looks amazing, and the fact that they are changing stuff and making it unique and different from the game is FANTASTIC"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"When the video game first came out, and I thought about what it would be like if a movie for this was made, I thought of Joe Manganiello. Mostly because he naturally has that rugged look. It will be interesting to see what Pedro Pascale brings to the role. I have loved every film I have seen this man in so far."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"This is absolutely unreal. Can't wait for this show to come out. Ashley as Ellie's mom, Troy as one of David's men is perfect."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Hope they did a good job. The game was brilliant and this has alot to live up to.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"At first I was like ""why should i care about something like this that I personally experienced through gameplay"". Then I saw the cast, the themes, the visuals, the everything. I just hope they deliver cause this franchise is beloved by almost everyone I know. If they can do this right then for those who never experienced the first game is in for a real treat."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,Won't lie. 1:25 sent shivers down my spine. Actually really looking forward to this!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I'm playing part 2 at the moment. Best game I ever played. Engrossing.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"Ellie pretending to twitch like an infected is totally in-character for her üòÇ I was skeptical at first how well they'd adapt this story to tv, but this trailer got me excited!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"So hyped for this. I know it's unlikely but I hope for the future seasons that alycia debnam Carey will play adult Ellie, she'd be perfect"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"The way how Sam reached out and hugged his older brother. Damn, I‚Äôm not ready for it."
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This would definitely be on my watch list if germany had HBO.
1,uLtkt8BonwM,This better be up to the level of how incredible the game wasüí™
1,uLtkt8BonwM,"My God, seeing Sam and Henry in live action cemented the fact that The Last of Us TV series is an actual thing!!! I've not been excited for a TV series in a long while now; having replayed TLoU 1 again and again, and also listening to and memorising its amazing soundtrack, I'm ready to sink all my attention and passion into this series! Gustavo Santaolalla is helming the soundtrack for this series, and I'm more than hyped up for the music!"
1,uLtkt8BonwM,That shot at 0:56 üòçüòç I'm SO EXCITED FOR THIS!
1,uLtkt8BonwM,although it is not yet released i dont want the series to be over
1,uLtkt8BonwM,I WANT IT NOW!! LOOKS SPECTACULAR!! Im so glad they shot most of this show irl and not in a studio with either the tech they used in Mando or green screen. Plus they shot it mostly in Canada!! WHOO
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the theatre in 1981 with my best friend from school. We were so stoked afterward we asked the ticket taker if we could stay for the next showing and he let us without charge. We called our moms from the payphone outside and asked if we could see the show again. They though we were nuts but said yes. We kinda thought it was silly too, but the decades have proven we may not have been so dumb after all."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where he says, ""I am tired of these motherf*ing snakes in this motherf*ing tomb!"" Brought me to tears with nostalgia."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy says ""I like high school girls, I keep getting older, and they stay the same."" Brought me right back to the classics."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When Disney said to Harrison Ford, ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse,"" followed up by Ford turning around to Michael Corleone and saying ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,"" I got a rush of emotion I hadn't felt in years. Truly one of the cinematic moments in cinema"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where Indy said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill my wife!‚Äù To which Sallah replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Literal CHILLS down my spine!"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I like how they all kept shooting out the window after he ducked. That's real dedication to aiming right there. Tracking targets is for people who miss.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"the part where the villain said"" our arrows will blot out the sun"" and Indy response""then we will fight in the shade"" was so inspiring"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where Indy said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill my wife!‚Äù To which Sallah replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Literal CHILLS down my spine!"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When he said ‚ÄúArcheologists,  assemble‚Äù ‚Ä¶ literal goosebumps"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part he took the crystal skull and took it to Dan Aykroyd to bottle it with vodka gave me chills. Truly, one of the all time."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"""I don't believe in magic"", says the character who literally saw the Holy Grail disintegrate one of his enemies and heal his mortally wounded father in front of his very eyes. I think it safe to say, that in this universe magic is a real thing."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy says ""get off my plane"" gives me chills! Looks like another banger from Disney"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the bit when Indy opened his eyes and said ""I know Kung Fu"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"the part where Phoebe Waller-Bridge said ""we're mildly related"" compelled me to go get castrated and now I am COMPLETE.... what a great trailer............."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Indy says ""Aaahh, I love the smell of queef in the morning"". Truly is a wonderful trailer."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Indiana Jones is now finding artifacts younger than him.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy said, ""I'm not locked in here with you, You're locked in here with me!"" gave me chills."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the moment when he sees the nazis and says, ""we're gonna need a bigger boat."""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love how the composers took the classic lietmotif and transformed it to a modern suspense theme. Man, this'll be fun to watch."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I love the part where Indy says ‚ÄúI¬¥ve come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass‚Äù Truly gave me chills.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I still cannot believe that this is going to be John Williams's final movie score, he is the main reason why I love music in the first place. He is a literal legend of music, the literal equivalent to the likes of Beethoven and others."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"My favourite scene was when Indy said ""Its Whippin Time!!"" And whipped the guy on the train and the guys in the last scene. Truly one of the greatest lines. bravo James."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy said, ""I'm too old for this shit!"" gave me chills."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I was in awe when Indiana turned to Stilgar and said, ""The Emperor sent us to this place. And my father came, not for spice, not for the riches, but for the strength of your people. My road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you‚Äôll have us, we will come."""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"It‚Äôs a solid trailer created by the GOAT. One of the most beloved characters on film 

I hope they don‚Äôt overdo it with a bunch of deep fakes crap and convenient story telling. After all - this trio (Spielberg, Lucas & Ford) have given us so much over the years. 

Let‚Äôs see them sail into history as the icons that they all are. They all deserve the best ‚ù§Ô∏èüé•"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I think it'd be great if for Indy's final adventure, the movie breaks tradition and actually allows him to put the artefact in a museum. He's earned it.
EDIT: as in the film‚Äôs primary artefact; I‚Äôm aware of his success with the Cross Of Coronado"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I‚Äôm loving how James Mangold is matching Spielberg‚Äôs kinetic energy with the camera and action scenes. I‚Äôm confident he‚Äôll do great.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Indy goes: ""I didn't kill my wife!"" and jumps off the the ledge.  Literal chills down my spine."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where he said "" I see dead people "" and then it turned out that Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time .. I was like "" NO WAY ! "" .. Gave me chills .."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"i loved the part where Indy says "" where we're going we don't roads""...truly a moment of all time"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Mad props to the stunt doubles who play Indy for 99% of this movie.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I'm stoked for the part when he says ""it's morbin' time!"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part when Indiana Jones says ""Never tell me the odds."""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I'm absolutely loving this trailer,I can't wait to see this movie it looks fantastic....."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I'm so excited for this new film. I wish we could stay young so he could continue to make Indie films. Harrison is awesome!! ü•∞üëçüíú
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,The ‚ÄúRaider‚Äôs March‚Äù theme will NEVER get old!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,The part where he rickrolled the neo nazis left me speechless‚Ä¶ truly a cinematic masterpiece. *chef‚Äôs üòö üëå
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where he pulls out the cigar and says ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes it's time to kick some ass!""

OMFG. That was so fucking cool that I had a panic attack. I can't wait for this!"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I love the part where Indiana Jones says ‚ÄúWake up Jesse!! We need to cook!‚Äù  It literally made me tear up
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Massive respect to Harrison Fords commitment of aging 70 years just for this role!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Indiana Jones is the reason for my obsession with learning different languages. Can you imagine how much more difficult his adventures would have been if he didn't speak the language of the part of the world he was in? Even at the age of six, I realized how useful such a skill can be. These movies changed me forever."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I‚Äôve been an Indiana Jones fan since day 1.  I love all of the film offerings out there.  They‚Äôre just plain fun.  As long as they put them out, I‚Äôll keep watching, eagerly.  Long live Dr. Henry ‚ÄòIndiana‚Äô Jones!  ü§†üëç"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part when Indy says - ""Come get some Baby"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I love the part when Indy says ‚ÄúHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEEEEEEEEEAAAH!!!!!‚Äù gets me every time üò¢
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where he asks Luke..""where did you dig up that old fossil?"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The scene where Indy says ‚ÄúHello, my name is Indiana Jones, you killed my father, prepare to die.‚Äù Was truly the most captivating moment in all of cinema."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love how Indiana Jones puts his hat on Waller-Bridge, smiles real big and tells her that she is now another sh**show in the collection of dumpster fires that Disney owns....  A truly memorable movie scene that everybody will remember for hours to come."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved when Indy said, "" Where's the beef?"".... Life changing."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy said ""Who's scruffy lookin'?"" made me laugh and laugh."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When Indiana Jones said ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my Paycheck,‚Äù I literally shed a tear."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I love the part where Indy says ‚ÄúAll we had to do was follow the dang train‚Äù Truly gave me chills
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I'm very excited to watch this movie! I still remember watching Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in theaters when it came out. I'll have to catch up on all the past movies before this one comes out. I can't wait!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where he says ‚ÄúNo, Shia LaBeouf, I am your father‚Äù‚Ä¶. Truly inspirational."

1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part when Indy said, ‚ÄúI am Ironman.‚Äù Heartbreaking."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Vader said ""Indy, I am your father"" rattled me to the core."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,You know what I miss? Well-executed stories.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I got chills with Harrison Ford said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Jonesing time‚Äù and Indied all over the Nazis.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I never have lots of goosebumps during movies, but that moment in the trailer where we see Indy stating ""My name is Jeff"" to those drug traffickers really made my spine curl."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where he says ""I don't believe in magic"" and then they show him those crystal skulls just makes me cry like I've never cried before"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where Indie looked at her and said, ""Boy oh boy oh boy.""
Go get em, tiger."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Seeing Sallah had me smile like a little kid, I‚Äôm surprised he wasn‚Äôt invited to the wedding in Crystal Skull"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Indiana says ‚Äú""I know what you're thinking: ""Did he fire six shots or only five?"" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well, do ya, punk?"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the line where Indy says ""Hey you're supposed to be the fastest thing in the valley man! But that can't be your car, that must be your mama's car!"" Classic and truly iconic"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Phoebe clobbers Indy with a golf club, and says: ‚ÄúCowabunga!‚Äù"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When Jones started flying and said ""It's Indy time"" best scene in the trailer"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,The part where the part happened gave me chills
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part when Harrison Ford says ""I know""."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part when Indy stuck his head through a cat-flap and a little kid said ""HELLO!"" was amazing"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I watched all Indiana Jones movies when I was young and liked each one of them, Harrison Ford is a legend and I'm looking forward to watch this sequel as well, especially now that part of it is filmed in Morocco üá≤üá¶ , my home country."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Indy tells Chewy, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre home‚Äù"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"That part where Indy goes ‚ÄúSo there I was, Barbecue sauce on my titties‚Äù had me in tears.ü•≤"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"This looks promising and i love the Indiana Jones movies . I am so happy to see John Rhys Davies finally return as Sallah .

The De aging effects looks really amazing. üòÆ"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the part where Boyd Holbrook says ""This belongs in a museum!"" and the camera turns to Indiana Jones snoring on reclining chair."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the franchise, at least the original 3 films. The 4th is growing on me in some ways.. And I've just watched the first official trailer for the movie, looks interesting but I've also heard some worrying rumors.

That being said all I have to say is...they better not do my boy wrong AGAIN. I'd like to believe this man's heart and soul is with this character and if they think they're going to get away with a ""woke"" or ""feminist"" role transition where they detract from a true masculine hero and burn it down by passing the torch to some chick or dollar store version...

It will be a disgrace to everything the franchise ever stood for. Indiana Jones is a national treasure and he ""BELONGS IN A MUSEUM!"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"It's not an Indiana Jones movie without ""Raiders March."" This will be the final movie scored by John Williams, and his music here sounds great as always. Let's hope Harrison gets a happy ending with Indy!

ALSO: I really wanted Mark Hamill to be in this movie. If he was, then it would make up for the Luke-Han reunion we never got in the Sequel Trilogy"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I like the part where he says its ""dialin time"" and then orders a pizza."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Loved the part where Indy says-He's not the messiah he's a very naughty boy!!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Anton turned to Indy and asked ""What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss"" had me convulsing on the floor! Truly a masterpiece!"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,Loved the bit where Indy says to Salah  ‚Äò I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around‚Äô. Gave me chills and goose bumps
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I still cannot believe that this is going to be John Williams's final movie score, he is the main reason why I love music in the first place. He is a literal legend of music, the literal equivalent to the likes of Beethoven and others."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I‚Äôve been waiting my whole life for a 4th Indiana Jones movie!!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where he lost the ability to control his sphincter muscles and proceeded to shit on us, brought a tear to my eye."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I loved the part when he found out he was a wizard!
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"Man, that scene where he barely escapes the Oompa Loompas at the chocolate falls and sang ""Oompa Loompa doopity doo, Indiana's got a whip for you"" will go down in history as the greatest moment in all of cinema"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,My dad took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark in the theaters when I was 9 years old.  Indiana Jones has been a part of my life for 40 years.  I was absolutely 100% certain that this movie was a mistake and they were not going to be able to pull it off.  As soon as the  music kicked in I had goosebumps on my entire body and tears in my eyes.  My dad is 82 now and this time I will be taking him to see this movie.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"When he said ""there is a tempest in me, it swept me to this island for a reason and I will not be quelled by you"" I teared up, truly a movie of all time."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I loved the part where Indiana Jones said ""You know I'm something of an archeologist myself"".. Literal goosebumps"
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indiana Jones says ""this is the end, my only friend, the end"" tore at my heart strings."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"The part where Indy did an impression of Admiral Ackbar saying ""it's a trap!"" floored me."
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,The part where Indiana said ‚ÄúSomehow Palpatine has returned.‚Äù Gave me chills.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I always laugh when Indy asks ‚Äúwhy is the rum always gone?‚Äù He‚Äôs so funny. Can‚Äôt wait for this one.
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,"I love the line where Ford said ""Epstein didn't epstein himself!"""
1,ZfVYgWYaHmE,I love the part where Indy starts a rap battle with Marion. I've never felt so sad in my life!

2,oJTpIicPhY4,Your wife did an amazing job being in the video. It‚Äôs nice to get a genuine feedback on what she thinks of a vehicle.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Everything makes so much more sense when she explains it. Lol
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Your wife is very sweet and genuine, thanks for including her.  Her observations make a lot of sense!  When you talk about GM SUV's, don't forget the Chevy cousins, Tahoe and Suburban.  I had a '16 Tahoe LTZ that my wife loved, but that fuel management system was a PITA.  I should have gotten the 6.2 V-8."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"You're a good man, Craig, genuinely caring about your wife and family. Props to you!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I enjoyed the two of you reviewing that SUV. It was a really good point that your wife gets to try a lot of vehicles in every day experience. Would like to see more like this.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Great video Craig! I feel like I would be happy to see her in some capacity in every video where it makes sense. She's a natural and has always been big part of Flying Wheels behind the scenes. Take care guys! üôÇ
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Craig tell the wife thanks for participating in these videos they make my day and I know it's hard work for you all üôèüèæ
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Definitely keep giving her time on your Chanel you guys make a great team.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Some of the issues your wife had with the 2015 Escalade could have been solved by simply reviewing the owners manual.  For example, there are controls for the radio on the steering wheel, so there is no need to touch the screen to adjust volume.  Plus, there is no need to go into the screen to adjust the temperature, as you can just use the touch controls.  Plus, the way you were using the touch controls was not the right way, by repeatedly tapping/stabbing at them.  Instead, you are supposed to touch them, and glide your finger in a left to right, or right to left motion (to adjust the volume, for example).  I don't dispute that CUE takes some getting used to.  It can be a little fiddly at times.  The controls in the GMC Yukon are big and simple and easy to use, but a lot of the criticisms that Cadillac's CUE receives are unwarranted.  I find the CUE system works quite well for me, and I like it just fine.  Its also curious your wife found the HUD in the Escalade a distraction, as the HUD in the Yukon is basically exactly the same.  Some of the specific issues she was having can be attributed to this particular Escalade, which obviously was poorly maintained by the previous owner(s).  I would have hoped you would have fixed the issue with the driver seat (and hence the related issue with the overall assistance system) prior to giving the vehicle to her."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"It was great to get your wife‚Äôs point of view as to how things work (or don‚Äôt) in a day to day basis.
My big take away was stay away from GM trucks when they are older.  As you went in and in about what doesn‚Äôt work, all I saw was dollar signs to fix everything."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Fun video - love your wife's perspectives!  For her next car consider getting her a late model AWD Hybrid Toyota Sienna:  comfort + reliability+ excellent fuel economy.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Your wife represents 99% of the female drivers. Make it nice inside and simple to operate. Thanks to her for participating! We need more of her on videos to correct all of our masculine overreach üòÇ.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I agree with your wife on the reasons she didn't like the Escalade. I feel exactly the same way. I loved the minivan interior also. Was that a Honda? Your wife did amazing in the video btw! It's very nice to get another female perspective from time to time. Even though I enjoy all the videos regardless! üòÇ
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Love the real world perspective of your wife. Great video. Thank you.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Great job you two. Amazing team effort - you bounce off each other so well - and one can see you know one anothers tastes. I say ease her into more videos...üòä
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I love the honesty in this video, I think review videos like this are super helpful. It lets people know what they are going to be getting into or what might happen. Also let‚Äôs the company‚Äôs know what‚Äôs wrong if the video gets enough traction."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Great video, your wife was very informative and my wife would have the exact same complaints.  I ordered the Fanttik 9 as well so thanks for the discount!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Love your wifes input. Do more.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Good to get your wife's opinion on the two SUV's. I saw her taking her eyes off the road all the time while driving when trying to navigate the electronics in the Caddy. That would drive me crazy as welll as being inherently unsafe. I think Cadillac have gone to far with those systems.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Another great video. I think we all really appreciate your wife's participation and hearing a lay persons opinion... 
I certainly believe that children's privacy is very important - so maybe you could just relay what their opinions are between the 2 SUVs and the vans..."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,She did an amazing tutorial! Please have her on more often or do.some reviews! Down to earth review and to the point. Job well done!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"One of your best videos,  very honest and practical review. I think 2015 was a pivotal year in electronics. A lot of new technology, but not really beta tested yet. The new technology was there, but not set up in vehicles very well ( hard to use and cliche)"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"100% with you on the steak/sizzle. TOO much tech with not enough quality to back it up. Not to mention the people who designed the systems didn't use common sense when doing it. It's kind of like computer systems: they are designed by computer geeks NOT users. 

I'd like to see the data on accidents as OEMs make them more and more complex to operate. ""we have included all these accident avoidance systems"" but the DOT reports more and more accidents per capita due to the complexity of doing even the simplest task."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"100% I'm with her on touch screens SCREW that crap. I rented some cars when my truck was in the shop and they didn't even have touch buttons below, everything was done through the screen. Listening to the radio and want to turn the heat down? YUP...have to go to the main menu, then hit climate control then find the button on the screen to turn the fan up or down or direct the air at your feet or face oh, loud song came on? same thing, have to back out of that screen and then go back into radio. 

Here in Ontario you can get a distracted driving ticket for fiddling with the radio...these touch screens are a 100% money maker for the government. 

I rented a jeep compass, OMG the gauges....mileage of vehicle, trip, distance to empty, fuel gauge, digital speedo, dial speedo, tach, digital tach, adaptive cruise speed setting, distance to the vehicle in front, then a warning if you get too close, lane departure image, adaptive breaking indicator, JUST STOP. I need a speedo and tach fuel gauge, temp, oil pressure GAUGES one glance, all needles pointing UP? I'm good. 

I have mark 1 eyeballs, I can tell how close I am to the vehicle in front, I don't need a sensor to tell me
I have mark 1 eyeballs, I KNOW if I'm in the lane or not
I have a right foot and know how to operate the brake pedal, I don't need a car to do it for me if IT thinks I'm too close
I don't need to know how much fuel is in the tank AND how far I can go on it....."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Great video! I enjoyed seeing both of you in the video and getting her feedback on the vehicles.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,She did an amazing job definitely add her to more videos in the future.... I would've chose the mini van as well lol
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Bring the wife around more often. she brings more flavor to the vids
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Craig...let your wife do some more car reviews. She's fun.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Wife is an amazing lady...should just give her minivan as Xmas gift üéÅ...never hurts to have 2 reliable family cars of one goes down etc...backups are great if u have the means..some people dont..
2,oJTpIicPhY4,It‚Äôs always good to have a fresh pair of eyes and her opinions were spot on.  My thinking is The more TECHNOLOGY GM PUT IN THEIR CARS THE WORST IT GETS. THEY DONT THINK THAT WHEN ALL THE CONVENIENCE START HAVING PROBLEM IT COST ‚ÄòA Arm & A ü¶µ‚Äôto replace.  I AM A MORE TOYOTA PERSON.  HAVING YOUR WIFE IN THE VIDEO WAS VERY HELFUL & INFORMATIVE.  THANKS TO BOTHüëç
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Totally agree about the HVAC system, it sounds cool, but it becomes a pain in the butt."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,It just seems to me that she needs to get to know it. Just like anything else. You can go in side the manual and look and see how you can get your seats and steering wheel that are heated. Adjusted to turning it on and off with remote start.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Another great video. Escalade looks too fussy and those controls
Definitely cause wandering issues. Good to see your wife in the video as well. Awesome stuff"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Your wife's response when you said @16:12 ""oh this is probably going to be nonsense to you""..was priceless..."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"*""The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same.""* -Colin R. Davis"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,The common sense assessment was so valuable. Thanks to you both.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Your wife did a great job describing that body style Escalade. We had a 2013 Platinum and went to a 2016 Platinum my wife hated for the exact same reasons. Then went to 2018 Denali Ultimate that she loved but was a lemon and had to go back. She now drives a 2020 BMW X7 M50 and loves it.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Craig‚Äôs wife totally loves the vibrations!!!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I prefer knobs as well. I hated the Cue on my ATS. When I worked at a Cadillac dealer I remember people buying these new with $20k down it was around $1200 a month for payments. And that was when interest was low to nothing
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"My Onkel actually has a gmc truck pretty sure a 2015, it has the 4 to 8 cylinder thing and he‚Äôs bent 2 pushrods in under a month. The second time it happened I was there and the entire car just clunked like we ran over a log and it just stopped dead in it‚Äôs tracks, right after that the engine started vibrating the car and making a clicking noise. Sad because they knew it was a big issue and still did it against in 2021-2022."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Magnetic ride control is nice. The seats vibrating when you get close to objects backing up is also nice. I like the HUD and although it's an extremely long vehicle and very wide, you feel confident behind the wheel. Also, even though it has the 6.2 under the hood you never feel the need to use it because it's a comfy cruiser. Hard not to like the escalade. My only gripe would be pushing the button on the door handle to get in or lock it. Not seamless like some other automakers."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Great video. Thumbs up for having your wife featured she is right about some of the tech in New cars
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Wow, she parks as slowly as my mom does!
The difference is my mom drives a fairly small Infiniti crossover!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"First mistake: Avoid the 2015 model GM SUVs at all costs. GM had put a stop sale on early 2015 models  due to suspension,  radio and transmission problems."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,My wife bought a new Suburban a few years ago for road trips she takes of 500 miles with our kids when she goes to Ohio and Florida from North Carolina.  She also hauls our kids and their friends everywhere. It was a pain in the ass in parking lots at the hospital she works at. I told her they are a pain cause of size which is why I always park my 3/4 ton Ram way out at businesses. She got rid of it and got a Yukon Denali after 2 years which is much easier to maneuver but can still haul people. Only gave up a little storage in the back.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Excellent job Mrs. Flying Wheels!  :)  Great video as always, Craig!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I wish i had the money to get the upgraded suburban, specially after seeing all the features in the Yukon XL. Still happy with what I have but damn what nice SUVs"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I am personally not a big fan of Chrysler/Dodge. Their 3.6 engine and respective transmission is notorious with being unreliable. But thanks for the video. I would choose Yukon over Esclade because of the details you pointed out. Thanks for the vide üëçüèª
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Well Craig you bought a brand new corvette so it‚Äôs time to get on the hook and buy her a new vehicle of her choice. Craig you just dodged a fast ball, awesome job."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Mrs. Craig did a great job voicing her concerns and issues. She's a natural. Having owned and driven a few Cadillacs with touch controls, they do take some getting used to, but I could work them well after a bit of use.

In my opinion, there is a big problem with her sitting position. The seat back is leaned too far back. Does she like to hold herself in in the upright position versus resting against the seat back? I never saw her touching the seat back in this video at all. Not even when stopped. Quite strange. Using a touch screen and touch controls while driving requires coordination and stability. If the car's momentum is moving her back and forth and such, it would be frustrating to hit the mark, so to speak. She's literally holding herself in place with one arm while driving. She's moving the steering wheel too much because of it too. With her back stabilized against the seat, I think the whole situation improves.

All that said, there is something to be said for at least some buttons and knobs for ease of use while driving. An alternative is a car with a driving assistant like a BMW X4 or X5. Saying ""Hey BMW"" will get any of those tasks accomplished without looking away from the windshield."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Yes have the wifey in more videos, she's sweet. Plus, more poppa Al!!!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I don't know how your wife put up with that car for so long, patience of a saint."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,For the key issue usually when you have both fobs together it wont read they key. You need to have one key in the car for it to start
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"The cue system is finicky as hell. I‚Äôm constantly turning stuff on or off and not even noticing. I am also on the second cue screen and it has a dead spot in the center once again. 

For the seats though hold the set button and the number down simultaneously until you hear it beep 3 times if you ever run into the run away seat again."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"4:01: why does her seat have a seat back if she's not going to use it? Does she complain that her back hurts after driving for an hour? If she gets rear ended she's going to get TERRIBLE whiplash. First from the impact of the vehicle then from being slammed back in the seat. 

Do the shoulder straps have that powder charge that cinches you tight in the event of a collision? She'll get injured across the chest when that fires as well."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Knew it had to be more than just ‚Äútoo many options‚Äù because you get used to that within a couple weeks and you don‚Äôt think about it again after that
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"You know what I always say.  üòä  But, your wife did great and should be in more videos imo."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Not just a testament to this vehicle alone but all newer vehicles going in the wrong direction arguably with all the technology like the screen fixed for $60 but 1800 at a dealer!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I would‚Äôve chose the Yukon, hands-down"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I totally agree with your wife. I think some cars are overly packed with tech which is difficult or distracting to use. Driving is an inherently dangerous activity and anything that takes away the drivers attention is a potential risk. Controls which are intuitive to use are way better, imo."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,So the main thing is how does it run? Does the vehicle run smoothly? What‚Äôs the gas mileage. Will get you from a to B safely. The important things.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I wouldn't touch a newer GM with a 40' pole. Rather have an Excursion or Expedition v8 if I had to have a large SUV. Would even take your first gen escalade over a new GM.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Craig at :40 seconds: ""She's actually very very easy""

Take it easy champ, thats the mother of your kids."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"My '19 Yukon Denali doesn't recognize my remote if it's in my pocket a lot of the time, even after putting new batteries in it.  Very frustrating!  My '16 Lexus LX 570 NEVER did that once.  My dad retired from GM and I get the employee discount, but the only reason I bought the Yukon is to make him happy.  Lexus is hands down the best!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Your wife should be in a focus group for GM. Tell them how to design their interiors.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,She has earned a gold medal!!!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Damn Craig you sold me! I want that freaking minivan now!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"The Pacifica is an excellent vehicle. Rented one on a road trip to Florida and the family and I loved it. Definitely for a minivan, beautiful"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,""" that increases so you can hide your dru... soda cans"" üòÇ sneaky sneaky Craig"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,That mini van looks nice and if you are only going to keep it for like a year it's probably fine
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I've just ""thumbs up'd"" a dozen comments - Your wife is great !"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Her eyes aren‚Äôt great, forgets her glasses and still drives. Nice."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,More wifey viewpoint. That was a refreshing change and useful for those of us looking at purchasing these vehicles.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Same seat problem in my 2004 Escalade. They like to sell parts, like 1800.00 touchscreens. And the infamous cylinder deactivation was first tried in 1981 . It was a failure back then, and a failure today. Want to make her happy? Get her a Lexus, but then you won't have videos to make about how much she hates it."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Thumbs up for sure. And yes, more wife. She did a great job!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"My Lincoln has those same touch and slide controls. Mine started activating themselves, causing the volume to go up and down and the tuner to change stations. I had to buy an entire waterfall off eBay and replace it. My Sync 2 screen also malfunctioned, so I had to replace it. Took the opportunity to upgrade to Sync 3. With all of the electronic modules in your Escalade that aren't working... Now you know why you got it so cheap."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"The Cadillac is more digital and the Denali is more analog. I've found myself stuck in the late 00's early 10's as far as feeling practical, comfortable and the longevity."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"And yes Taryn needs to be in more videos, even though I know she hates to be in videos she did Great"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"You have a great wife üéâüéâüéâ
She was wonderful in your video"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"TBH if it's for the family go with a low mileage 2014 Gen 3, skip Gen 4. Gen 5 isn't bad... so far.
Almost forgot AFM delete in the Gen 3."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Yep mom did awesome she needs to be in more videos. Maybe go to the auction and help pick cars
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I bought a used 2014 Cadillac CTS4 (all wheel drive) in 2017 with 32k miles on it. 
MAN... I loved that car! It had the turbo 4 cyl engine, was fast, and handled like it was on magnetic tracks!
I had her serviced early and regularly for every single needed service.
The 90k was the expensive one. $3k.
But... at 103,000 miles she started making that telltale noise from the rear end so I sold it back to the CarMax I bought it from.
Pricks only gave me $11k for it, which was $100 more than I still owed.
They deducted $2000 because the CUE screen had the infamous spider web corner cracks on the CUE screen.
It had already been replaced under warranty once too.
Caddis are wonderful cars, until they hit 100k. Then they start breaking.
Got me a beautiful, garage kept, low mileage, 2016 F-150 King Ranch with every available option and absolutely LOVE it!!!! She looks like she rolled off the showroom! Not a bit of surface rust ANYWHERE. Even the drive line."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I‚Äôm a car guy and I can see when the MRS checked out on you talking üòÇ
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Come on Craig! You can get that dvd out of the head unit in 30 seconds!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Yes more videos with her she is so cool God bless you and your family amigo saludos from San Antonio tx
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"I'm completely with her, I want easy to find and use knobs."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,GM is like we want all these features on our vehicle but we don't wanna spend that much on these features. Let's spend more on the presentation side of the features but let's spend less on the technology that helps the features function properly.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,The screen off button turns off the dash screen. It‚Äôs that way on FCA vehicles.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,It sounds like your wife needs glasses when driving!
2,oJTpIicPhY4,The reason the car alarms when started with the door locked is to prevent CO Poisoning
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Your wife did a great job. We got a minivan because our kids would fling the doors open and smack other cars. The sliders saved lots of dents.
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Yes have your wife on your videos , she's funnierüòÑ"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,Reckon the alarm going off if you don‚Äôt unlock after remote start will be part of the anti theft
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I think the alarm goes off after 5 minutes from starting the car so you don't end up with a carbon monoxide situation in an enclosed space like a garage.... whether the car be left on accidentally or intentionally....
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"The most Expensive version of this Escalade is for sale for 3.6 million EGP which is 180,000 USD and the reason why it is selling for this much is because of the taxes in Egypt and the dealership that is selling it is Elshazly Motors in 6th of October, Egypt"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Great video ! I think the best way to describe your wife is like mine, she‚Äôs a simple lady, NOT easy!! It just don‚Äôt sound right üòÇüòÇ"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"Dont make your wife choose between both vehicles,  just give them both to her. She will have options on what to drive just like you."
2,oJTpIicPhY4,"""We're old and don't like computers."" Look, we're about the same age, but I don't complain about new technology lol. I learn it. But the active fuel management is garbage!"
2,oJTpIicPhY4,I have heard a lot of the DOD problems is from people pushing oil changes 2 or 3 times as long as they should I'm not saying it's something I'd make if I was gm and if I had the money and was buying one I'd probably delete it and put in a truck norris cam or something

2,D7sXpPdku1I,"This Hyundai Palisade is pretty impressive Joe. In my opinion, I would take the Palisade over the Pilot. I do think that the interior in the Hyundai is a little bit more, I'll say, classier. Kinda of Genesis inspired in a way. No hate on the Pilot though, liking what they did for the redesign for 2023. I can't wait to see if you do the Palisade XRT Joe! I think you already did the Tucson and Santa Fe XRT."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Just got one of these. This trim and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Love the looks inside and out and drive is also great and can fit everything I need. Took it on a short 600 mile trip and comfort was great. We love it and recommend it to any family.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,This one's already a common sight here in the Philippines. I've seen a few of these on our local roads. üáµüá≠
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Looks snazzy. Can't wait to see the redesign of the Sante Fe and how much has been incorporated from this vehicle to that.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Great video as usual Joe, love the work. Im really looking into getting an XRT version of this car, in the grey specifically, for my two new children. Unfortunately, not a single dealer has one to show me. If you get a chance to review one, please do so!! I would love to see it."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Wow, at 9:37, I think the cops came to arrest you for driving in extreme style üòÇ great review as always, joe!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,NO one can do car reviews the way Joe does ‚ù§
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"This Hyundai has one of the most beautifully designed interiors, in my opinion. Great review Joe!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"I agree with you on the zonk about the rear door locks. It's so annoying on a daily basis.  But more annoying is the headlights at night. Why doesn't anyone discuss this? I love my Palisade but avoid driving at night now because of the awful dark horizon they make. It's super distracting. I see road and then the V shape shadow infront of the car and a distinct line of light to darkness on the sides. I had an Expedition before this and loved how it light up all sides of the road so beautifully. It's so bad for me personally, I've been searching and seeing what may be my next option and Pilot might be it. I don't want to give up my Palisade, it's not even a year old, but again, the lighting is a problem for me personally. One more small zonk is the Auto Hold feature. I LOVE to use that feature but when you hit the gas it hesitates for a moment and on the school pick up line with the stop and go, that gets well... annoying too. Oh, wait... 1 more thing.  Im not a huge fan of the retractable holders. Kinda plasticky and cheap feeling. I feel like if I put a cup in the wrong way and hit it, I'll break. I'd prefer a nice solid piece cupholder.  Otherwise I swear  I mostly love the vehicle and I always LOVE your videos!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Great review! We love our 2021 Palisade Limited AWD. We went with limited because it included all of the tech found in calligraphy but didn't include the suede headliner or quilted door panels. That was important because ours is a dog transport machine and I didn't want either ruined by slobber or claws tearing out threads.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"JOE JOE ~ needs quad exhaust to give it symmetry - I dig the way they did the side trim at a C pillar - both front & rear light design = good, actually improved. I like the wheels, they aren't over done or too freaky looking - they have a lux look about them, which is nice. the color is weird - on video it comes across midnight blue or even black at certain angles, from the side looking straight on you can see the deep green in it. tony"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,I think Hyundai did a dandy of an SUV and I think for a refresh it gives it a stylish SUV.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"even for the ‚Äòold‚Äô pilot, i‚Äôd go for it over this new palisade. bcoz i know that, that old pilot still gonna runü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,This one looks good ! But I think new Pilot looks more spacious . Pilot exterior looks good as well ! Moreover Honda is reliable ! Only issue is with d infotainment screen . I am waiting for new pilot !
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Thanks all for the content, it still boggles my mind how a lot of luxury vehicles still do not have alcantara suede linings at like 70 to 80k and have plastic black boring speaker covers"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"That thing is ugly to me but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, (too much cheap shiny plastic). I prefer the looks of the new pilot, and the materials used for the interior are of much higher quality, (plus the engines are reliable)."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Thing I‚Äôm gonna say is that Hyundai definitely copied, the vents that goes across the cabin and also bottom gear. Don‚Äôt like the fact they still got reverse light on bottom, like to have it on backlight. Pilot is the KING for the off-road"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,You sold me Joe; I'm going to my Hyundai dealer first thing Tuesday. I hope they can find a Palisade that has what I want.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Never liked the exhaust on one side.  Either dual exhaust or eliminate it all together.  I‚Äôve noticed many new vehicles are eliminating the dual exhaust.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Would love a Raitis Rides special showcasing Florida's finest drivers...could probably be enough content for a second channel
2,D7sXpPdku1I,One of my tops SUV‚Äôs because of the HEATED and COOLED seats in the mid row at this price point(not to mention the quality)
2,D7sXpPdku1I,I think Hyundai would‚Äôve been better off putting two exhaust tips on the other side of the vehicle to balance it out that would probably look pretty bad ass.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"More than 280,000 Hyundai Kia vehicles were recalled over concerns that they could catch fire if parked indoors.  Automakers report 25 fire or melt incidents in the US and Canada"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Roasted like a cooked turkey back in the third row seat, you had me laughing. üòÇ"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,The Palisade is a beautiful SUV see these all over more top seller than Pilot and Highlander. Very true Hyundai has come a very long way over many years good looking vehicles.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"It definitely needs a quad exhaust‚Ä¶So does it‚Äôs cousin Telluride. It is the only reason I‚Äôm not buying either one. If I‚Äôm going to spend over $50k, I want the quad exhaust.
I‚Äôm hoping their second generation will be born with quad exhausts. Then I‚Äôll surely get one!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"I prefer the previous grill. This new one looks like they took the giant front grill pill that other manufacturers are doing,ie lexus, bmw, audi."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Still go with the 2023 Pilot Trailsport for off roading :skid plates, trail cam, recovery points and IVTM4 AWD way better the the twin's HTRAC AWD."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Great value for the $$
Non luxury brand with same features as many luxury brands‚Ä¶..and a n/a freakin V6 !!!!!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Yes it‚Äôs as good as the new Honda pilot

But unequivocally the palisade absolutely blows the upcoming Toyota grand highlander out of the water no ifs ands or buts. It‚Äôs just a fact. The grand highlander lost badly in shame to this and it‚Äôs not even out yet"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Great cars,not that great salesmanship,service,support. 
Hoping their dealers learn how to talk to people."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hyundai Palisade is more flashy and up to date with technology. Honda Pilot is more bulky and more capable of off-roading/handling rough terrains.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hey Raiti's Rides Can You Make The All New 2023 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV SEL Touring
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hi Joe love the Chanel but didn't u already do a review of the palisade  calligraphy edition  3 months ago.  Just wondering  if they did some updates since then ???
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Yup! It should be quad exhaust! Zooooonk!!!
I do believe you LIKE the Palisade better than the Pilot, which makes me happy bc I own a PaliCali üòç
You....and your booty call ü§£ 
It's been a minute since I've laughed so hard at a YT video.  
Keep up the Fantabulous work, Joe n Lori! 
Looooove Ya!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Well Joe, what‚Äôs your choice between this or Honda Pilot"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"The palisade is definitely better to me than the 2023 pilot.the warranty is better,360 camera,heated seats in 3rd row,vent seats in second row,but dealers always want alot more that msrp.i know people that paid up to 15k over msrp,that's crazy i would never do that period."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,I love it Joe and Lori and keep up the good work and I love the video üëç üíØüíØüíØ
2,D7sXpPdku1I,From first looks of the pilot looks great. Interior definitely better then the outgoing model but the palisade wins. You won‚Äôt confuse anything of what‚Äôs on the road today. These can turn heads if people don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre looking at. The Interior for the price you get and value is shocking. Then you get the impressive technology which the other competitors lack
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Microphone needs a wind screen! Thought I was making some popcorn

Great vehicle and great review as always joe!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Leaps and bounds beyond ALL competitors! Thx Joe!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Why is it that when Hyundai and their suvs like you always say Top Dog as in top trim, like the XRT and the Caligraphy, their SUVs don't have those the XRT and the Caligraphy  whenever your talking about the rear of the SUV? How much is the 2023 Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy and what's the MPG?"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"It's kind of makes you wonder how Hyundai is able to put so much money into the interior of the Palisade. They have been top dog for a several years, and I haven't seen any manufacture that can make something that can top them.  Are they sacrificing long term durability? 
I really wish the new Pilot came with the new 12.3"" screen. It looks ridiculous to have a $52k Pilot Elite then have the plastic trim around the screen. It's obvious that they designed it for a larger screen but changed it at the last minute. I can't imagine that there is much of a price difference."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Always is a zonk when I see A dual exhaust in one side
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Funny thing Honda was the first one to offer the right  turn signal cameras and then stopped offering, the Hyundai started offering with both left and right turn signals."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,$52K is a very good value for what you get here. No wonder dealerships haven‚Äôt been able to keep them in stock!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,One of the best looking suv's of the segment but I fell in love with the new Pilot and I would go for it.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Too late for the wife and I, we went with the Explorer STLine after you reviewed it"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,This is what my grandpa should've gotten over the Ascent
2,D7sXpPdku1I,My dream Korean SUV!! Good review Joe.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,I would get the Telluride
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Not only does it sound like a vacuum cleaner the horsepower numbers are pretty anemic if they put TwinTurbo on there they could probably bring that motor up to 400 hp.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"J ~ I'm sorry Lori makes you wash the clothes down at the river. I think the mic had some signal issues - cracks & audio noise. I really like Honda, simply because they build solid stuff that lasts & retains resale value, BUT the design language of Honda has got to take some risk, I'll see a brand new Honda on the road, yet it already looks outdated design wise, to put it nicely Hondas look boring. I feel like with a leading warranty of Hyundai & the big time improvements the company has made over the years with fit & finish & engines, tech, etc. in this case I'd say Hyundai. great report by a great guy. have a great weekend - tony"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Hope you're doing well, Joe!"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Def need dual exhaust. Of course, not many have true duals these days. =("
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"As a SoCal resident, I find the driving issues in this video relatable..."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"‚ÄúOne phone for your friends and family and another phone for booty calls.‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to the third row and see if you can your booty can fit in this palisade.‚Äù 
Wow excellent sir! üòÇüòÇ"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,What about ventilation of 3 row?
2,D7sXpPdku1I,King of Engine Defects Hyundai Kia !!!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Y won‚Äôt they tuck the back wipers in & also joe that should be a quad exhaust
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Still an UGLY and WEIRD fascia to me. No getting used to it, like the AMC Pacer."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Inside looks like a luxury  car
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Happy Friday Joe! Palisade time!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,what is going on here -  same model review 3 months ago ? Joe are you repeating yourself or forgot you already made this review 3 moths ago ? always Quality over quantity - we do not need new video every day if there is nothing new to review .. üòâ small color change compare to your existing review is to small change to make same review twice ?
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Koreans are doing one of the best jobs promoting their cars, got give the credit‚Ä¶.."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,I want to... but I just can't get over the front grill. All I see is a giant electric shaver.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Omg how much does this damn thing cost?
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"I knew Al Cantera once. We were friends back in the day. He was like a big teddy bear, a real softy."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hyundai has come a Long Way...
2,D7sXpPdku1I,The door lock thing is strange and potentially a safety hazard.  You probably checked on this but can you confirm that  the child locks were not engaged? Why the passenger door panel already has scratches ? People trying to put their hard plastic drink cups in the door cup holders that are always too small for it? It looks bad and cheap. Maybe the previous model year had better front seats and door trim
2,D7sXpPdku1I,ROFL took a ROCK and wrapped it in thin material. That is a deal breaker where my elbow sits.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Looks nice .
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Joe i like the new 2023 Hyundai Palisade but i like my 2022 lincoln avaitor grand touring it has more tech and better mpg
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"That.  Look , Hard üíØI Will Driver That üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Pathfinder looks a little beautiful
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hey Joe HYD on this wonderful friday
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"No, it's not. Pilot 10/10 times."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"This is such an ugly vehicle, that front grill is hideous. The interior is decent but the exterior of this machine is a just awful. The Kia telluride is so much nicer than this."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Why don‚Äôt they offer the all black exterior in the calligraphy model??? Hate all the cheap looking silver
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Is it just me or is his mic making noises?
2,D7sXpPdku1I,11:50 Wrong info. There is no wireless Apple Carplay or Android Auto. Only wired
2,D7sXpPdku1I,i thought it was wired apple and android?? you said wireless.
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"I don't mean to sound like a Honda-Fan-Boy ... but I'm an old guy and my preferences have switched from flash-in-the-pan electronic gizmos to better reliability, lower maintenance costs, and perhaps better resale??? ... but then again I grew up riding Honda bikes and driving Hondas and yes even worked at American Honda Motors HQ in Torrance CA as a Project Leader for their Honda  new car line (btw I was there when the first Integra Type-R was introduced and could have bought one at a reasonable price ...  what was a bonehead decision it was not to buy one) ... so I am no doubt biased ... thanks for another Great review... Keith Chicago IL"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,This or grand cherokee L 2023????
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Half fir the wiper blades not hiding
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Joe still comparing cars on his title? Didn't i told joe to change the title up before we start to get bored with the same question for the pass 3 years?
2,D7sXpPdku1I,California drivers aren't much better üòÇ
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"Sorry for asking, can you please let me know which one is better 2023 pilot or 2023 palisade?"
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Joe i know its not your fault.... but honestly please fix your microphone situation... I'm sure you've heard it so much and these are prerecorded for a while so you can keep up with content... but its time to fix this and replace your mic please sir. Love these vids and would enjoy them so much more without the abject noise. Thanks!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Best car review channel on YouTube‚Ä¶nobody comes close‚Ä¶
2,D7sXpPdku1I,"I like the car but not that the car has only 1 engine, thats a little bit sad for a car this size and weight."
2,D7sXpPdku1I,To be honest I liked my Ford Explorer ST way better than this vehicle and has 400 hp not like this is a little anemic six
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Why would any one even entertain thinking about purchasing a Hyundai or Kia considering how they treat their customers? Class action lawsuit!
2,D7sXpPdku1I,Hey joe this Hyundai palisade this is awesome SUV
2,D7sXpPdku1I,üç∑üç∑üç∑ü•Éü•Éü•É enjoy your weekend.

2,PY4momJCoLY,been watching for years now strad. look forward to every video and the positivity you bring! congrats on the new car and all the success
2,PY4momJCoLY,Really excited to see what your up to with that Huracon! It‚Äôs gonna be sick to see it on the channel.
2,PY4momJCoLY,"The first video of James that I ever watched was the F60 America video back in 2016. Of course I then proceeded to watch his older car spotting videos, old videos with the lotus, and of course him taking delivery of the Gallardo. Now, 6 years later, it is absolutely incredible to see how far he has come, and how much he has accomplished. It is all thanks to his hard work and dedication to his craft, and it is a fine example of how anyone can achieve their dreams, no matter what the circumstance. From living out of his Audi tt, and only dreaming of one day driving a Bugatti, to now owning 6 lambos, 2 (kind of 3) Ferraris, and a Bugatti veyron, it really just goes to show that no dream is ever too big to accomplish , and that no person is ever too small to succeed. thank you James for being an incredible inspiration to all."
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Congrats on your new purchase! I've been introduced to the channel just a few months ago, and I have to say, the amount of work you put in these videos is insane. Keep up the good work!!!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"James is by far my favorite automotive YouTuber. I love the energy he brings in every one of his videos and his content is never dull.  Can‚Äôt say enough about how much respect I have for him as well.   Not many people can say that they literally built their entire following on their own from the front seat of his Audi R8.  It takes balls to do what he did.   Going from making car spotting videos to basically betting everything he had to buy his Lamborghini Gallardo and using it as his diving  board to dive head first into unknown waters.  I really can‚Äôt say enough in regards to how impressed I am with his ‚Äúnever give up‚Äù mentality.  He truly is a role model in the sense that if you work hard enough towards your goals and never give up, even in the face of adversity, anything is possible.  

That being said,  thanks James for always entertaining on your channel.       And lastly.   Much respect for ending every video the way you do.   A picture of your dad and the car that started it all for you.    
Always stay grounded"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"James, another amazing video! I suggest going gloss paint from factory as you could always matte PPF it, or wrap it a different color! I've always thought matte paint looked like wrap, especially on camera haha i'm sure any spec you go with will be amazing tho! keep up the great work!!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"This looks like an awesome car to own, James just actually has to use it for it's purpose"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"James, I just want to congratulate you and I am proud of how far you have come and I have been watching you since you bought the Lamborghini Gallardo and you are almost at 4 million subscribers and that Lamborghini tractor would be great with a twin turbo engine again congratulations."
2,PY4momJCoLY,James is such an inspirational man from sleeping in an Audi to owning a 2 million dollar home and a multimillion dollar car collection
2,PY4momJCoLY,Its times like this when you'd appreciate having a heated driveway like Damon lol.
2,PY4momJCoLY,You should‚Äôve got a heated driveway so you don‚Äôt have to deal with the snow at least part of the driveway cause it could be expensive but would definitely be worth it later down the line since your staying in the house for a very long time
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Congrats James! As an unbiassed ‚Äúabsolute huge strad fan‚Äù financial advisor, get the bike bro üëÄü•≥."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Awesome how you went from going to car presentations to look at them to buying them. YOU ARE AWESOME
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I've been watching a LOT of videos and doing some research on heated driveways, totally would be a good move in the future, nothing like never having to plow or shovel again"
2,PY4momJCoLY,I have a feeling they decided to build this after all of the random off-road nonsense James did with his Gallardo üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,This guy has come from zero to hero only ogs know about it‚ù§ü•± proud of you stradman
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Man I can't wait to see the finished car, I know this you will choose the coolest spec for this car."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Yet another moment to appreciate James  for what he has done for the car community! üôÉ
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Great video as always! But I couldn't help but think to myself, with everything you put into the house why did you not get a heated driveway and walkway? You would never have to shovel snow"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Hey man, been a fan since 2017, I loved ur content, keep it upüî•"
2,PY4momJCoLY,I love how the first reaction to the exhaust is to upgrade it üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,"DEFINITELY get a heated drive way , it saves so much time and effort , the drive way is always ready to drive on ext . No Ice or snow to slide your experience cars on and damage them"
2,PY4momJCoLY,It‚Äôs crazy how I stumbled to his channel and now I‚Äôm invested into this man‚Äôs life
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Strad: Allen is our expert on everything Huracan Sterrato. Which also mean ‚Äúdirt road‚Äù in Italian. 

Allen: I didn‚Äôt know that."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Personally for snow I‚Äôd recommend for the snow a Bobcat MT100 or the Bobcat S70 skid steer.
2,PY4momJCoLY,"In the air force moving to Utah next year, then getting out and spending the rest of my life there. I seriously can't wait. Praying one day I'll see the stradman driving a super dope car üôèüèª"
2,PY4momJCoLY,Really excited to see what your up to with that Huracon! It‚Äôs gonna be sick to see it on the channel.
2,PY4momJCoLY,Oscar's chillness is the perfect counterpart to James' mania.
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I think you should for sure have a livery on your car, and then you can just wrap it afterwards!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,James be rockin' with the uploads lately
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Success is great and I've been watching for several years, but boy this channel has jumped the shark. How are we supposed to get excited and passionate about a new purchase when it's an everyday thing and it's almost like he's not even that excited. This is like buying dinner at Texas Roadhouse for him picking up these multi hundreds of thousand dollar cars. It's just not as fun anymore. ."
2,PY4momJCoLY,4:55 the snow was like ‚Äúyou get away this time‚Äù
2,PY4momJCoLY,11/10 YouTuber. The one YouTuber that I don‚Äôt skip the sponsorship on because it‚Äôs still entertaining üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,This guy takes delivery of more cars then I do Amazon packages üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I can't wait for this car, I think Verde Citrea would be a great colour choice, and have the Verde Scandal wheel accents with the Morus rims! OR, match the Gallardo and do Arancio Borealis!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,Should have done a closed loop hot water heater system in the driveway and you'd never have to shovel or plow snow...with the new hot water heater designs it'd literally cost pennies a day to run it.... super awesome way to heat a shop too ...
2,PY4momJCoLY,I can‚Äôt wait for a Lamborghini tractor! I was also thinking you could just get a mini snow plow to match the mini countach. That would be sick!
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Id recommend putting a VF supercharger on the huracan so its still reliable, a TT kit might ruin it"
2,PY4momJCoLY,If you‚Äôve went this far on the house just heat the driveway it can still be done after the original pad is already in place
2,PY4momJCoLY,I've watch hundreds of you videos. Way back when the how does a 27 year old afford a Lamborghini. I was blown away. Now Strad is buying and trading Exotics on the regular. Now I just need to buy myself a Lamborghini!!
2,PY4momJCoLY,"The end just caught me off guard.  A veneno in the wild!!! That's obsurd, but I agree with you James, you will own one! Keep up the good work"
2,PY4momJCoLY,Ive been watching you for 6 years. You really are the most genuine person in the car community! Im so happy for you and all your success James. God bless
2,PY4momJCoLY,Ohhmy G's Ive been watching you since your Audi TT and now your road to 4K subs üî•Man youre the must humble human being in car community James  an inspiration  much Love   from your fans here in  beautiful  city of Manila Philippines‚ù§Ô∏è
2,PY4momJCoLY,IDK MAN‚Ä¶I HAVE SOME PRETTY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THAT ‚Äúoff-road‚Äù Lamborghini.
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I can‚Äôt wait for the day he says ‚ÄúGuys, I‚Äôve bought the Veneno!! It‚Äôs mine baby, it‚Äôs mine!!‚Äù Someday one day Strad!!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"That mat green spec is just amazing, but many cars will be ordered that way so might want to chose something unique for you"
2,PY4momJCoLY,How come you didn't opt for heated driveways? It doesn't seem like it would be too expensive in relation to the house and it would've helped immensely
2,PY4momJCoLY,You know James is buying a car when he has the strad bag loll
2,PY4momJCoLY,The headlights look like an afterthought that they just bolted on. And I doubt that it would hold up on any kind of off road scenario bigger than a unpaved surface.
2,PY4momJCoLY,James should hold a competition‚Ä¶ whoever can spec the Lambo as close as the one he ends up getting wins a prizeüòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,The military green looks sick I think a rugged color is the way to go or maybe even the military sand colorü§ôüèª I‚Äôm so excited for this car delivery I can‚Äôt wait to see you beat the hell out of it üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,11 hours in and we have 91K likes. Looks like there will be a Stradactor in our future.
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Strad should buy a canam defender 6x6, it would be perfect for all of his snowplowing needs, and for off-roading where regular cars can‚Äôt üòä"
2,PY4momJCoLY,Congratulations! Load it with everything! Once in a lifetime chance! Go crazy with the outside color and inside! I know for sure you will buy that venano! Can't wait! Mark my words!
2,PY4momJCoLY,its everytime a good day when stradman posts
2,PY4momJCoLY,This guy never disappoints!
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Go rugged on the color and trim options, it fits the point of the model. Besides, you already have enough bright cars."
2,PY4momJCoLY,I think you gotta go with a color they really hides all the dirt and mud or go completely opposite and do a white or something like that so all the battle scars show up from far away. Either way it's one of sweetest cars ever made by Lamborghini! Congratulations manüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ!!!!
2,PY4momJCoLY,6:20 stradman being more knowledgeable about the product than the salesman itself üò≠
2,PY4momJCoLY,The new Lamborghini looks amazing.
2,PY4momJCoLY,I'm so proud you James. You have never cease to disappoint me
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Imagine if he really bought the tractor, lets give The Stradman the likes guys‚ù§"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"In CA, as long as any type of lighting you have under the oem headlights, can be on and used on highway."
2,PY4momJCoLY,All the money spent on the house and you forgot the heated driveway üòÇ Damon was right. It‚Äôs a must
2,PY4momJCoLY,We need more content feels like forever üò£
2,PY4momJCoLY,Back in 2016 I saw 2 Veneno‚Äôs side by side paired with a 918 spyder in a dealership on Long Island. I was 15 years old then so you could imagine the freaking out I did. Craziest car I‚Äôve ever spotted. Was the white roadster with red accents and the one in this video I believe. Back then they were worth half of what they are now. Still can‚Äôt believe it.
2,PY4momJCoLY,i think it needs lights on the roof to and little more lift with all terrain wheels
2,PY4momJCoLY,Your house is awesome but I do have one small question why didn't you put a heated driveway in your budget?
2,PY4momJCoLY,That Chevy looks like it‚Äôs ready for the bone yard already üòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,"It's always a good day when stradman posts, I hope everyone has a good day. üòÅ"
2,PY4momJCoLY,I know it‚Äôs a ‚Äúoff-road‚Äù Lambo but I wish they‚Äôd paint match the fender flares
2,PY4momJCoLY,"*Lamborghini:* We're relaunching an Aventador LP700 with a new colour that's all.
*Strad:* I'm buying it."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Heated driveway would've been a good investment üòÜ ü§£
2,PY4momJCoLY,Heated driveway woulda been a clutch install
2,PY4momJCoLY,"There are 2 people in this world that I hoped would get the Sterrato - The Stradman himself, and Damon from DDE. 
Thanks for bringing one of the most exciting supercars of the past decade to youtube James."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Imagine James getting the sterrato. Then asking B is for Build to give it the same proper long travel suspension as the Jumpacan. Then twin turbos. Now that is the ultimate offroad Lamborghini huracan
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I will say, the off-road Lamborghini is one that‚Äôs special with the military green or a more lowkey color. Any other car can rock the bright colors, but this one is  something where it‚Äôs more special in a suitable color."
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Can still remember when this guy was without a job, then started his youtube journey‚Ä¶.."
2,PY4momJCoLY,Strad really needs a fourwheeler with a snowplow
2,PY4momJCoLY,Always a good day when James uploads
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I feel so accomplished right now, James acknowledged my comment in the video i am one of those people that suggested buying the land infront of hes house to keep that view forever and it was mentioned in his video. Words cannot express how i feel right getting the recognition from such an important person in my life means the world. James you are incredible. Much love from Australia as always i love you man you‚Äôve done so much for me. ‚ù§"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"You need to buy this, LINE-X the body, straight pipe, VF engineering supercharger and a more off-road based wheel and tire setup!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"Road to 4 million, u come a long way but there is more left, big fan since 2017!!!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,I love your vids James I have been watching you from the start man from you living in your Audi TT to this lifestyle congrulations manüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú  I also press the like button on all of your vids and subscribed to allll your Channelsüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
2,PY4momJCoLY,Can we just appreciate how much work he puts into these videos?
2,PY4momJCoLY,You need a heated driveway. That's all. Forget the tractor. Have fun with your specs for the new Huracan. You're greatest buddy. Love the matt green
2,PY4momJCoLY,"That Lambo bike is dope, those type of bikes are called ‚ÄúGravel‚Äù bikes, it‚Äôs like a road bike that can off-road, just like the Sterrato."
2,PY4momJCoLY,we definitely need a tractor on the channel
2,PY4momJCoLY,You should definitely go with the neutral colors! Or get neutral colors on the interior and get the car in white or black because you can always wrap it!! üî•üî•üî•
2,PY4momJCoLY,I love how optimistic he is about everything!
2,PY4momJCoLY,This man buying supercars just for his 11-12 min vlog!üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇüòÇ
2,PY4momJCoLY,"I was hoping you were talking about the sterrato when I tapped the video, you did not disappoint as always"
2,PY4momJCoLY,James spent all that money and didn‚Äôt put a heated driveway üòÇ come on man. But love the house and content
2,PY4momJCoLY,TheStradman Awesome Video I'm glad you got to see those All new Huracan Sterratos and I think it's absolutey incredible that you're going spec one out and I think you should go with Blu Cephus with the Green and black Interior and I think you should definitely get a Lamborghini Bicycle
2,PY4momJCoLY,Can we just appreciate how much work he puts into these videos?
2,PY4momJCoLY,"With how much you invested into that house, you really should have opted for a heated driveway. Especially in Utah! It would help drastically with that runoff from the roof and the back shady bits. But anywho, congrats on getting to spec the new Sterrato, that thing is GNARLY!!"
2,PY4momJCoLY,"James, it may be a bit late, but you should've gotten a heated driveway."
2,PY4momJCoLY,"For the color of the car I would go for a super flashy color, the least chosen by clients in fact, making it more rare. Then I suggest getting it wrapped in something else of your liking, and thus protecting the original paint. How about letting your subscribers submit designs for your wrap and then you let people vote on it?"
2,PY4momJCoLY,Looks like it would like fire with all matte/carbon black with possibly any color livery to make it stand out like josh amg gt
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,So great when Angel Food Cake is around.... as Sarah definitely ramps up the 'goof factor'. And that's just pure entertainment!!!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Compliments to Angel for the Instagram edits. Especially pleased that you're able to get a break from doing it all by yourself. Your integrity, personality and signature is still on the final production. No loss of quality in what I've seen so far."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Glad to hear that you are getting some help to free up your time better.  And the car reviews are awesome! I hope you keep mixing 1 in, every once and a while! Great job Sarah!!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Pretty much all of Sarah's video's have an element of ""crazy"" in them, this one though goes up to the ""Crazy as a Box of Frogs"" part of the scale, loving it, keep them coming kiddo!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Fantastic dedication! And there‚Äôs actually an engine lurking under all that extra hardware.üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Great video!!!  One of your biggest challenges ever.  No one else will show the true work that goes into restoration work as you do and I think it‚Äôs wonderful.  If anyone can do your father‚Äôs engine justice, it‚Äôs you!!!  Can‚Äôt wait for the next video.  This content is excellent!!!üëèüëèüëç"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"So, in addition to being the hardest working YouTuber, you are also an expert at removing rusted fasteners without breaking off or stripping bolt-heads.  Apparently repeating the word ‚Äúcarefuling‚Äù has some telekinetic power‚Ä¶ most impressive. üòâ  Thanks for great Friday night entertainment, Sarah! üëçüëçüëç"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Most ppl appreciate Sarah's nonsense. So refreshingly light hearted.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Whether here or there (your reviews), your technical knowledge and mechanic abilities are interrelated in that way.  Plus, the fun it looks like you're having in your reviews is worth the price of entry!  Thank you and Angel for all your hard work.  Top notch channel!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Best TV Youtube Show ever !! and this is going to be the totally coolest Celica restomod in the country , can't wait to see the extreme detail Sarah brings to this build !!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Really like how relaxed you seem when you have a helpful Angel Food Cake around. Love the relaxed and happy Sara!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Always something unusual ‚Äì in this case, an engine with acorns as accessories. Gotta say I've never encountered that myself, and I've driven a couple of pretty high-mileage vehicles."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Thanks Sarah for that truly fascinating video. Looking forward to the engine rebuild ü•∞
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Pretty sure there's never been a happier engine teardown in automotive history.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Whatever makes Sarah happy, makes us happy.

Especially when you do it in the dirtüöô"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Excellent video.  Why is it so rusty. Was the vehicle from a state where they use salt on the roads in snow ?  I‚Äôm a big fan of pulling out the spark plugs and pouring in some ATF to help free up the sticky front balancer bolt.   It is going to be a cool as build !!üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"The way this engine is going, we're going to see ""Sarah learns to how to remachine a block"" before this car is done :)"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"OMG - that engine look like it (and the Tundra) had been sitting in tha cargo hold of the Titanic on the bottom of the ocean...  Will be interesting to follow the resurrection, Im sure the difference between now and the finished thing will be like night and day... Also: Never, ever, ever stop doing car-reviews! Ever! You are the best car-reviewer out there! Why? Because it does not matter what kind of car you review, you allways make them 100% interesting and 100% entertaining to watch, with  the prefect mix of tech-nerdy infromation and entertaining fiery-jokes-fun. With other car-reviewers, I might pick and choose, but with your reviews I don't have to, because I know it will allways be pure gold. Just don't listen to the random sorry individuals who don't get it. Also Also: gotta love and respect Sir David Attenborough - real-life hero!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I‚Äôm amazed with the work you do,,, and you don‚Äôt look like your getting dirty. üôÉüòÄ"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I love the car reviews as well as the shop stuff equally. I watch the for you. I laugh at the random things you come up with like the Mario pipe level music and also I totally got the ""Please don't go"" reference.ü§£ü§£ü§£. Also the squeaking sounds when you curse especially when they seem to get progressively dissapointed when you say a stream of curse words.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§¶"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Where have you been all my life, lmao ....great job on tearing it down. I just subscribed and your content is unmatched and priceless....Never quit and Never surrender.....keep grinding...love the channel.. ."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Love ‚ù§ these videos. I‚Äôm almost disappointed when a project is complete but there‚Äôs always more in the pipeline üòä Each has its own story line and tremendously satisfying to see the end result. You are extremely talented!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I‚Äôm glad I get all of your ‚Äúsomeone gets that reference‚Äù references, including when you said hamburgers. Also, I hope AFC (who I‚Äôm happy is making more appearances) helping edit your vids means more content more often."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I had a dream where I was putting something random together like furniture or something and Sarah was looking over my shoulder saying: ""You're gonna iceblast that, right?"""
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I've never seen a rusty engine. Your dedication to rescuing something from your Dad's truck is admirable.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Amazing to see you expand your channel, and start delegating tasks so you can keep doing what you love (or so it seems!). Love the idea of the Toyota muscle car swap. As a former Vermonter, I feel your pain with all this corrosion... Seems like you're coming out on top though! (no pun intended)"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Great work so far Sarahüëç I had a 2009 Tundra, I really missed the V8 power that it could laydown, fun trucks. You know what likes chew on wires?? Rats, those little buggers love chewing on plastic and rubber. Had to have wiring harness replaced because of them......... üòûüòû"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,It‚Äôs amazing that a little water can do more damage to an engine than a 900lb moose can.   The amount of corrosion is amazing.  I do have faith that is it doing to be Sarah-N-Clean like everything else you do.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Can‚Äôt wait to see the before and after rebuild video
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"It's hard to believe there is a salvageable engine below all that rust barnacles. NH car dealers should install zinc anodes onto the frame and the engine of all cars they sell, not even as an option, by default."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,The car üöó reviews are great! Hope you keep doing them
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Happy you have help!! Can‚Äôt wait to see this project‚Äôs progress.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Chippy Chex Mix, the New England favorite. Enjoyable tear down along with some snappy tunes. Hopefully the stack of reusable parts is large when you're done sifting through this Davy Jones locker of calcified remains. Bravo for bringing on AFC for some editing assistance. Same output, more playtime!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,From the little acorn a mighty engine will grow.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,That looks a lot like my cars used to look when I lived in Michigan.  LOVE Arizona cars!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt break.‚Äù Sarah, thou must acquire a induction heater. Those devices are beautiful like‚Ä¶ carefulling.exe(parameter:married). Look up the Mini-ductor Venom. Focused heat sans a torch. A couple of patient minutes later, ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù rusty bolts turn like magic via a wrentch. If I were a wealthy person, I would send you one, but alas ‚òπÔ∏è Highly recommended."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Sarah, you are definitely unique. I enjoy your running commentary."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Who would love to work alongside Sarah for a day. I think I‚Äôd be laughing too hard.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Great video! The engine looks beat up, but YOU are the MIRACLE worker!  You CAN make it brand new again!  ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,It will be wonderful to see that poor engine looking beautiful when you're done with it.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Sel-ee-ka!

Nice to see this little sports car get some attention. Never seen bumper bars tlike those on one before. Never seen a V8 in one though. I recon some skinny 302s found their way into a few in the 80s and 90s though.. Fun project eh? Hope all goes well. Regardless, I look forward to watching."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Maybe an engine stand would be in order.  Great job.üòä
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"My ADHD brain loves you Sarah , I can perfectly understand and appreciate your Sarah - isms ü•∞
When neurodivergent minds mesh üòâ"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I love you review vids but these projects are something else! My dad and I always worked on trash engines like these and my first project car was a 88 celica.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I loved Teeter Tot (despite the trouble it gave you)! Love the Bronco! And Gram's Ranger is the best! Watching you and your projects are just ü§ò! Thank you Sarah.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,SARAH and ANGEL show !!! Love it !!! New intern !!! Keep up the great work  !!!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Sara n tuned is addictive, I even don't know why I like watching it."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Your work is just fantastic. Keep it up, you are  amazing!üëç"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Idiocracy ain't that the truth. I'm looking forward to this build I love the old celica's
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,That rusty engine seems way more work than it's worth. I know the engine is from her father's truck but looks like very little is actually salvageable.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,It's so refreshing to hear you say aluminium correctly üòÑ
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I can honestly say this video is the first time ive ever seen someone vacuum an engine. Thats original content right there people!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"When you remove all the garbage, it actually looks like an engine!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Thank you Sarah that was very satisfying to watch, I hope its ok inside."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Love your content. Been a big fan of yours for 6 years now.
How to you manage to stay so clean and immaculate working on your stuff..except for the glue incident on the bug? Lol
 Is Angel Food Cake, Lil Sarah's Lil Brother? I see a striking resemblance.
 Take care of your fine self, Sarah.   üñ§"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Great to see Angel taking a shot at the editing (or at least narrowing it down for you) üëçüèª
I know you have to cater to the ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù but I do hope you keep true to yourself. 1 of the major reasons why I keep coming back to this channel is your enthusiasm and personal take on everything. Whether it be reviews or projects, everything is shot well and told well. üëèüèª
Got all the references by the way. üòâüëèüèªüòé"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Great that you finally found some editing help!
I sure hope that 2UZ isn't too bad... 
Or we're going to see some cylinder boring and honing?"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,That engine has a nice bolt!!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Hi @SarahnTuned, how cool would it be if you'd find a shop with a vapor honing machine near you. Especially one where you could do the blasting yourselfe. OCD served to the max ;) And as always so fun to watch."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Nevermind, I thought the engine was being saved for something. It appears to be completely locked up!"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Awesome content. I wanted to do something similar. I have a 94 Land Cruiser. Wanted to swap in the Toyota  v8. Ended up putting an ls 5.3.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Put some mystery oil in the spark plug holes and penetrating oil on the exhaust manifold nuts!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I have a 2006 Tundra DC with the exact same 4.7L VVTI, really fascinating watching this teardown."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Great video.  You are so entertaining!   Glad to see you got a helper
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Don't overlook the blue wrench, an oxyacetylene torch is crucial in any car shop. When you think the bolt will break, stop! Add penetrating oil and gently screw back in, rock it back and forth and ease it out. Far easier to do that than drilling out a bolt in an alloy block."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Awesome project this, Sarah!! üòÉüëå"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Not sure what path you are going to take on the Celica, but Industry Garage (Street Bandito) is offering (limited run) carbon fibre wheel flares for your generation of the Celica."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,My wife and I love your car reviews too!!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,A happy Sarah is a happy channel!  Love the car reviews...and these breakdowns and rebuilds!  üòÅ
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Although you are a miracle worker and have incredible tenacity I think that engine is just too far gone to rebuild, even for you."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I had too go back and get a third. Close up of the alternator. üòä
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Deconstruction... Somehow therapeutic..  the only engine I ever helped tear all the way down was a 68 Chevelle 396. I was 17 and It was WAY EASIER than this Toyota.. The 396 took two weeks of evenings and two weekends of work .. so... To my point.  I want your viewers to understand how cumbersom and convoluted this engine is and the effort needed to do the job needs to be stressed. In 68 the wiring harness took like 10 minutes to remove.. this thing was plumbing and harness and some stuff I never saw before..  Sarah is the girl you want on your side in a bar fight.  Nice work I can't wait to see you take out the nuclear fuel rods.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I admire your tenacity and skill tearing down the engine.  However, it has to be the ugliest v8's ever produced with all its appendages and strange design features.  Starter in the valley?  holy crap what a maintenance nightmare.  I am very curious now."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,And re: car reviews - whatever makes Sarah happy is fine with us.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,The vacuum pumps sole purpose is to allow that engine to pass CA emissions testing. The pump runs for only the first few minutes after the engine is started. This action forces more air into the intake... doing so changes the exhaust air/emissions mixture ratios when the engine is cold.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Not only are you skilled but you must be strong as an ox.. I can't believe it cause you're so slim, but the stuff you can lift and unbolt takes true strength. What are you a superhero from a comic book? Love your videos."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Watching you dismantle this thing makes it clearer why basic engine designs can be iterated on for decades. Not an easy thing to design from scratch.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I've never seen an engine with so many little doo-dads attached to the outside.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I feel your pain.
I once had Disney's Small world stuck in my head.
Wanted to take a drill to my temple.
üò≥"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"These are great Sarah , However the car reviews are really informative and prefer those frankly‚Ä¶"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"im betting youll get Suzie 2UZ fixed up and shoehorned in the Celica in no time.  maybe turn whats left of the celica and your dads truck into a sort of tractor to water the fields of Az with Gatorade since, you know, it's what plants crave."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I bet there's never a dull moment working with you.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Those bolt extractors are a lifesaver - especially with snapped wheel locks.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"i think putting the starter under the intake, is a real asshole design!  Lol  I cant wait to see you put this engine in the Celica. I think its going to involve some KY and a shoehorn . =D"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I‚Äôm thinking an engine stand will make your life a lot easier (and safer.)
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I really enjoy your auto reviews. They actually give information I can use. Plus, have you seen Motor Trend reviews? Yikes! Talk about boring."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I wouldn't have known what FOD was without being a Land Speed fan, but I guess that's appropriate when watching a car channel."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"I am always glad to see car reviews for the reasons you enumerated in the video plus my own selfish desire to see what you are going to dissect next.  
Besides, there's no bolsters to  test in the shop."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,Without a doubt the most fun engine teardown I‚Äôve ever seen.  Dugga-dugga
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"""That's disguuuusting!"" needs to be an Angel-Food cake T-shirt. üòÅ"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Personally I enjoy the vehicle revue videos.R.Kelly reference was pure gold,or at least a light amber color.LOLü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§™"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,We know it's seized. I hope it isn't too bad. If it can be saved I have confidence Sarah will get it done. I love sitting on my butt watching someone else bust theirs!
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Sara -- Remind us again how long the truck was immobile after its encounter with the animal?   I know the front was heavily damaged which probably damaged the hood which allowed water infiltration.  However, given how clean the INTERNALS of the engine are, how did the OUTSIDES get so corroded?"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"The engine is most certainly corroded on the outside. Apart from the block, heads & hopefully the wiring loom, everything else will need replacing. I do hope any ECU's you need are salvagable."
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I wonder if anyone makes a battery terminal cleaner thing for power drills and rusty bolts
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,I think I like the car reviews pretty equally. Whatever that's worth.
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"You are braver than I. I love my Dad but you know this is above and beyond. What a mess. And OCD is not helping, other than the organization used to sort the parts coming off. One broken bolt is a miracle. Looking forward to the motor tear down. Wonderful project. At first i thought oj great a Beatle and now this.... but you made it great like Granny's truck. I had to see the final to Granny's truck everyone had one. So this seemed to attach to the same heart strings. All the Best, D"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,forgot that this has to go in the lovely old celica.  you will make it fit im sure....
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,"Sarah, I love your comments and enthusiasm in your videos, I really enjoy your channel !"
2,hf6jAF-n-yI,your car reviews are great!... the best
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I love my Atto 3--""OTT interior"" and all--so I don't really agree with some of your criticisms, but it's great to see a genuine and well-balanced review. Thank you!¬†
Atto 3s are selling like mad here in New Zealand and all the owners seem to love them. It might be nice to switch to a Seal though."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,I've been keeping my eye on this car as I absolutely love it. I'd have to go for the longer range version but I would prefer to have this car in an estate version for more space for my family stuff.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Looking forward to BYD arriving in the UK, they are very impressive cars. The Atto 3 will give the ID3 a run for its money"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Kind of disappointed in the boot, would have preferred a Hatchback in my opinion. Also although the inside looks plush, maybe tone the seats down a bit, especially the rear ones and those tear drops on the rear. Otherwise a damn fine looking car. 
Needs to come in at under ¬£40 though to be a contender in the UK market, but might be possible if BYD get into Sodium Batteries for their car's by 2023 as suggested recently..."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Not to mention they have the best battery tech! looking forward to see them in UK
2,5avV2qJuVhY,That looks like a lovely car. Handling engineering first then focusing on looks second is the only way to get that sort of next-level efficiency. Can't wait to see a right-hand drive one in real life
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"This was the car Top Gear and Jeremy Clarkson predicted the Chinese Industry would evolve into, a decade ago. They did an episode in China where Clarkson would predict Chinese cars would advance dramatically, welp we're here now."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I really miss the liftback tailgate on this car, it having a sedan trunk really limits the practicality of this car."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Great report Elliot. Keep up the good work. It seems these new EV cars are getting more technical by the day. Driver feedback or dynamics as you call them are a big part of the driving experience. Tesla have taken this and spun it around. I‚Äôve driven the model S and model 3. They don‚Äôt feel very engaging and the model 3, dual motor is so flat through the bends. I think we‚Äôre getting away from the driving enjoyment and turning the cockpit into an entertainment system with way too much automation thrown in. I saw the Funky Cat locally the other day. That does look like a fun car."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Outstanding to see, finally we get to see an in depth review of a car that is worth looking at. If only it could make it to the UK with a decent ticket price. Shame they are making 200,000 cars per month yet they still are not for sale in UK."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"The setting with the animals is so nice üòÑ.
Elliot's presenting is getting better each video."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Looks amazing, apart from that awful cheesy ""build your dreams"" on the back. If it ever does make it to the UK, I wonder what parts availability will be like? I can't imagine getting a set of ball joints from Eurocarparts for it ü§£"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Looks like the base model of the Seal falls into my budget, 350 Km is probably enough especially if the improved high speed efficiency and slipperiness of the Seal give better high-speed efficiency than the other models. ( I want to charge it on the weekends with solar rather than every few days overnight)."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,I‚Äôm really impressed with a) the production. & graphics in this video b) the quality of the Seal - VW should be very afraid!
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Model S range for just 40k, that's a good deal right there!"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Looks fantastic. I'd have to get 'Build Your Dreams' off the back though. Looks like a Halfords add on.üòÑ Great review of a nice car.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Great looking and very promising EV, let's hope it reaches the UK at a really competitive price. My only criticism would be why rear wheel drive rather than front for the 2X4? It also comes as 4X4 so front wheel drive is immediately possible and preferable for bad weather traction. OK so the ""frunk"" would be lost but potentially regained in the trunk."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"BYD seems like a company that could produce an alternative to the ID Buzz 
ü§î"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"For the Ocean theme, they've ""pushed the boat out"" - nice looking car"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"They could improve the ""cool"" factor 1000% simply by replacing the ""Build Your Dreams"" on the tailgate with ""BYD""."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Hope they make an estate version! I love it  but how am i gonna fit a baby trolley
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Why can‚Äôt they make this in estate!? I‚Äôd preorder the AWD today if they did.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Good video, would have liked to have seen the rear seats though."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,This production is exactly the reason why everybody loves this other guy who explains cars in 60 seconds .. or showslike now you know .. the real stuff
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Great production quality, very nice to watch the video.
As to the car, we'll see when it gets here. Competition is never bad."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,As a fan of electric cars I really hate how few options we get in the USA.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,If it's imported it will be close to ¬£55k + so will be up against established competition . Could be a good second hand purchase after expected high depreciation due to brand awareness.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Shame EVdirect(now BYD Australia) here in OZ screwed up the warranty and servicing. 
It‚Äôs an amazing deal in NZ, and a exempt nightmare in Australia. 
What idiots just for a cash grab"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Thanks for the review, highly informative and helpful. Just a quick correction suggestion if I can, at 5:40, the unit of Price in China should be RMB, not RNB :)"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"It only gets tougher for Elon from here.  Out-luxed at the top of the market, and out-priced at the bottom, Tesla will be left to battle it out in the hyper-competitive middle as more and more 'legacy' brands bring EVs to market.  Believe what you want, but the Tesla Moment is over.  Auto will NEVER be a monopoly market, and the Silicon Valley con of Musk owning the future is wearing very thin.  Bubbles go POP."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Thank you Elliot, great review.  The Seal is as dull to look at as a Tesla Model 3 and as impractical as any other saloon car. But hey, I hope they sell it in the UK for considerably less than a Model 3 to give buyers more affordable options"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,if it was in a wagon then i could see it being a huge hit.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,BYD should sell those white caps on Ali and Amazon.  üòéüëç
2,5avV2qJuVhY,BYD coming to the FullyCharged UK North Show this year? Would be good for them to gauge the market and to see how your reviews translate to what we would see
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Great quality video, but we need more detailed content; it is closer to a advertisement than a critical overview.. Elliot does a great job."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Looks fabulous. I'd consider this definitely.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I absolutely love your videos. BYD is a great engineering company if they can focus more on design, products will be way better."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Sold. I‚Äôll be looking at this as soon as it arrives in the UK for ordering. Great video.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Did Elliot mention the predicted range of this and the 4-wd model? Perhaps I just missed it.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,The only thing I like about it is the panaramic sunroof.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,The ride height (or lack of) might struggle on UK speed bumps. I feel like we have been hearing they are coming to the UK for too long.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,It will be interesting if BYD australia will carry over the same warranty as China as their Atto 3 warranty is all over the place.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Thanks, it would be rude not to ask when the engine and the engineering quality of those will be incorporated into the great videos you guys are amking, but arnt the engines after all the star ofm the show? Again, just a thought from my side."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I will take this over a model 3 even if it were priced at same level. it is a bigger and better (except autonomy if u opt to pay for it on tesla) car overall. right now, production capacity is the bottleneck. waiting time is too long."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I like the look of it and it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs not another bloated, high-riding SUV. 
The structural engineering is impressive too. With the right pricing I‚Äôd look past the Chinese origins, although some may not be happy to do that. 
Nice editing on the video btw."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Never understood the obsession with transparent roofs, if you want a cabriolet then buy one. 
Much more useful to put some solar panels on instead, some are even semi-transparent."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,This car could give Tesla a few things to worry about
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Thank You! Elliot just makes the best Reviews!!!
2,5avV2qJuVhY,The era of BYD is upon us - and nothing it's going to get in their way
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"30K Euro starting price and up to 40K Euro for a compact Chinese car. The Leaf didn't sell back when it cost 25K Euro's and that's a well-built Japanese car from a major manufacturer. No, the MG4 is going to fail miserably in Europe."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,I look forward to the day Elliot learns how to review a car without sounding like he's trying to get a job with the company. 
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Love Elliott's review, while I'll need to tweet him the ocean is lovley. Seal name: lovely. Must ask if he had a bad experience with the ocean(s). Lol."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Can we take a moment to appreciate the production in this video!!!
2,5avV2qJuVhY,We need hatchback version on this platform.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"What a great design EV, this is what the Tesla model 3 should've looked like."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I would love a BYD, but whats the bet that China do something to cause import sanctions."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,With ground clearance as minimal as that it's going to have problems with some UK traffic calming infrastructure.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,I was keen to get into a BYD then I saw styling of the ATTO 3 which was bonkers. This looks to be toned down but still not as nice as the MG4 which it looks very similar to on the outside.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,We need cars available in UK but even this is bigger and more expensive than we need
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"I wonder if they would give the car another name for exporting to EU, like the way they call an Atto 3 (Yuan Plus in China).
Name aside, the car appears to be a nice one."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Nice presentation as always Elliot..... keep the goats in all your future pieces.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Does anyone know if the headlights have active shadowing?

And the 0-60 times, do they include rollout?"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,All BYD need to do now is sort out their agent and the debacle that is their warranty here in Australia.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"After 2 Tesla M3, the pretty but inefficient Polestar 2 AWD I just got, this could be my next car."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"This is a good looking car, if I could afford a new car this is a serious contender for my money."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,‚ù§loving the transitions in this editüëè
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Looks good, but can we reference EU and UK dealers, servicing, when known.
Are Chinese EV imports possible?
How do updates happen?"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,The main message I got from this is that the Seal has been toned down
2,5avV2qJuVhY,When are we going to see these cars here?  No sign of EU car makers disruption happening  yet.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Seal is A1. Any sign of Seagull from BYD? Thanks for wonderful review, Eamon"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Absolutely great car with nothing to compare from European legacy. Hope to see the Seal in Switzerland soon, as with MG they do not plan yet to sell in this small but important EV market. If the car works here other regions are no problem!ü§ìüá®üá≠"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"The Xpeng P5 would have been a huge hit in Europe at ‚Ç¨29k. It's priced ‚Ç¨50k over here though, so no one buys it."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"""It has now been revealed that it will launch in China with a starting price of $31,860 USD"" Your mileage may very."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Let's hope they make a Wagon or Sportback version
2,5avV2qJuVhY,I‚Äôm sure it will be great. I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs a good thing continuing to buy everything from the Chinese.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"""This Chinese EV Is Going To Be A HUGE HIT In Europe"" I have seen more convincing commercials than this one. Strangely, they forgot to tell that this is an advertisement."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Why is the name 'Seal' unfortunate? I think that it's a brilliant name; far better than Metro, Escort or Nova."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,The car's design reminds me a lot of the Kia EV6.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Glad to see proper tires fitted on this car, unlike the generic useless crap most Chinese vehicles are shipped with."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,When BYD hits Europe it's going to be a painful experience for legacy car makers. Vertical integration has not been adopted by car makers in the west (besides Tesla). With some design tweaks for the European market they'll be a force to be reckoned with.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Hold on one second, that‚Äôs a ¬£34,000 car, and that‚Äôs at the high end! Oh my God, they are going to clean up"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Definitely prefer the aesthetic of this car to Tesla Model 3. Shame about the low roof line. Bit of a deal-breaker. Very curious to see how it sells in the UK.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,just remember that its a state owned enterprise and they can turn it off whenever they want.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Nice Video, nice EV from BYD. This will be the poor man‚Äôs version of Model 3, which will inspire the owners to scale up to a real Tesla.  Audi TT was just that, and many TT owners ended up with a Porsche later.  Just an observation üòä"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"BYD aside, the quality of these videos have been getting better and better. The editing in this is one over the moon! I'm proud to be a patron for tens years or so."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Small mistake on your graphic at 2:54. The 230 kW power of the long range RWD model equates to 310 hp, not 210 hp. There is no way that heavy car goes 0-60 in 5.9 seconds if it only has 210 hp on tap!"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Can we please have a comment if the height of the seats, especially the rear. Electric cars often have very low seat squabs because of their underslung battery. It should be mandatory to comment on this. Knees up is not a comfortable seating position"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"thanks, when will alll these great companies come to the UK? Cant you guys arrange some inteviews with their executives?"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,What about the charging speeds? And what‚Äôs the infotainment like? I feel like elliot‚Äôs videos are sometimes missing some core details and focus on little things‚Ä¶ sometimes a comparison to other evs or brands could help as well‚Ä¶ :/
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Very good video and I am looking forward to own one
2,5avV2qJuVhY,‚ÄùDo the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.‚Äù - Lao Tzu
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Great content, you might just need to check your hp figure, instead of stated 210hp should it not be 310hp. Thanks..."
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Interesting how many other competitors have avoided trying to compete with Tesla head on. And at this price Mondeo man can go electric without buying an SUV crossover.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"Tesla just launched in Thailand with crazy cheap prices. Elon just screwed Geely(Volvo), BYD and GWM (Lightning Cat)"
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Didn't say how many miles per kWh it will do.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,It‚Äôd be a huge hit in the US too if it were allowed to come here.
2,5avV2qJuVhY,Why have something that looks like a model 3 when you can just get a model 3 ?
2,5avV2qJuVhY,"BYD now's neck and neck with Tesla and it looks like
in  6--11 months, they will
pass Tesla."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I see what you did there John.  I noticed that you didn‚Äôt mention removing the ICE, etc., and I nearly fell for asking why, but in the end I guessed, correctly as it turned out, that it  probably wouldn‚Äôt significantly change the point of your presentation.   What I didn‚Äôt realise yesterday is that not mentioning the ICE etc., was part of your cunning plan to generate -ve engagements by trolling the fanboys, and then whacking them again today.  Well played JC, we‚Äôll played."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I agree with a lot of the stuff you entertain us with! I also love the look of all your brand new unused tool on the wall.  The way you use large print notes warms my heart. As a person with low vision I have always done this. John is fair dimkum 
."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I'm dying to see the specifications for this truck. Any fleet has desk jockeys pouring themselves into the specs looking for the best one. The empty weight is a HUGE deal, I have stories to tell about that. As John says, they are not releasing this info. Pepsico, carrying chips (or crisps, if you prefer) can get away with a heavy tractor because the freight is light weight. But for heavy cargo, that's a different story. 

I work for a large trucking fleet. One of my jobs is, whenever new trucks or trailers come in, is to weigh a sample of them. For some heavy loads, we're stuck with a combination of tractor A with trailers B or C to carry very heavy load D. It can be arranged, but it's a real headache to plan these loads."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Outstanding as usual John and spot on with your original review. No need to justify or try to explain yours and all of our thoughts and facts regarding this comical proposed idea as a long haul heavy vehicle.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Some operators may still benefit from the reduced payload capacity. Some loads will be much lighter than others, either due to lightweight goods or only carrying a partial load. I think you will find operators will likely have a mix of electric and ICE trucks, and distribute the loads in ways that make sense."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Love it. Facts rule. I thought about the weight difference of changing over the drive chain to electric. For five seconds (I'm a bit slow). I realised that it might be similar if not more. Not rocket surgery. Well done JC.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Check out Nio EVs with their battery swop stations. I see no reason you couldn‚Äôt scale up for truck‚Äôs although agreed liability for failure would still be a potential issue.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I thought the original video was excellent and well argued. 

Also, John - have you looked at the new Honda Civic hybrid? I know how you feel about Honda ... But high price not withstanding, the car is incredible. Like seriously good. Have test driven the petrol twice and the hybrid once now and likely to buy. None of the four other cars I've tested can match it in driving feel, cabin experience, spaciousness and general good vibes. It has an x-factor. Interested in your thoughts. (Btw, discovered your channel 5 month ago and it's become my go-to for car industry thoughts. Appreciate the hi quality, free content!)"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,I do love the A4 format John. Entertaining yet concise at the same time.  Regarding the E semis longevity I know that its economically justifiable to rebuild an ICE engine and or trans at some stage down the track...but I wonder just what the economics of having an issue with a 5.5 tonne pile of Lithium Ion batteries would be? I know its not economical with the current crop of EV shopping baskets?
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Thanks JC. I agree with you. It is going to be an expensive exercise to ""upgrade"" to EV semis, for sure. If the mandate comes, the long range haulers will probably have to go back to the old ""Pony Express"" way with a fresh, rested and charged unit within range. Swap over and get going again."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,You have said what many are thinking. The fact there is no weighbridge in the PR trip is a deafening silence. And even more drivers required in a driver shortage. Starting to look a bit tired. There are Janus trucks in Oz which use replaceable batteries. How much would the solar system  of the size that you quoted  cost with panels and an inverter? I'll keep my Road Ranger experience current I think!
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, love your presentations, they are  wonderfully prepared, informative and entertaining I would like to add a couple more thoughts in support The multiple more times truck will need charging eg once or multiple times every day will lead more quickly to the deterioration of the battery  which will lead to a reduction of storage capacity and  efficiency. The truck will need more downtime for additional charging  to make the required journey as efficiently will be greatly reduced  also how long will the battery last ? and Will owner drivers and-businesses be able to afford the replacement cost? Considering the size I imagine it would be a significant cost. 
Thanks again 
Neil"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Another small consideration is that the diesel truck is getting lighter as it travels, an EV battery stays the same weight the last time I checked."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,It seems that the weight problem comes down from the energy to run the vehicle having to be on the vehicle. I wonder if there is some way to continuously run the energy into the vehicle as it travels from say overhead wires. It seems electric rail does that very well and with the additional economy of minimal rolling resistance from steel on steel. Seems to have been around for over 100 years already.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,i commented on the earlier vid and still agree with a lot of the questions i ask. the one thing i will tell you is the tire lifespan on the drivers will be shit. the super high torque will eat the tread off them and tear the sidewalls apart. we had that problem with 600 hp and drivers with heavy feet. a hole lot of trucks cube out before they hit gross weight. or can't axel right at gross wt. do you think a 53' trailer full of potato chips weights 50k? average semi tractor weight is about 12.5k lbs it will be fun to see what the tesla semi is. less weight longer range. after driving off and on for over 30 years i would like to drive one at 80k over donner just to see what it is like at 60 mph verses 35 mph for ice engine. drive time from reno to sac and back would be a lot less. and i wonder just how good the dynamic braking really is. i still wouldn't drive a skateboard to the east coast from the west. and you are still an infomercial.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"You're a brave man John. 
Going up against all these Tesla bots in the comments will be 10x worse than your regular peanut gallery."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I spose looking at the weight of the tesla  semi  with all its electrical  components 
You could look at the electrical  components  of the diesel  locomotive 
I realise that a tesla semi is not a locomotive 
But it makes you wonder  just how heavy the tesla semi unloaded compared to a diesel  semi actually  really  is and why the Musk rat is tight  lipped on that  releasing all the spes 
I suggest  that tesla semi is quite  a bit heavier than its diesel  equivalent  and the muskrat doesn't like things that don't meet his facts 

John certainly  makes a good point"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"The health of Australian truck drivers also at risk, how many pies and how much Coca Cola will be consumed while waiting for the truck to charge"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"JC, this isn't a case of you being wrong, right, or somewhere in between. This is a case of follow the maths and physics, review the resultant facts and draw the logical conclusions.

Physics doesn't give a sh!t about anyone's feelings. Your conclusions are spot on. 

Mechanical, light current electronics and IT engineer here.

I don't like or dislike your videos; I watch them for the facts, logical conclusions and resultant discussions. Oh, and the ming molls....

And a cursory reading of the comments section of YouTube is a great indicator as to why democracy is such a bad idea.

People have been fooled into believing that being entitled to their own opinions extends to being entitled to their own facts."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"John, you are not the Messiah just a 'Very Naughty Boy' for creating all this controversy. 
Keep up the excellent work and making the youtube videos that make us think outside the box!"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"G'day John. This is some back of the envelope food for thought based on your 40 truck business example. Applying the same rough thought process I went through while modernising the fit out of one of our older datacentre sites, this changeover from diesel to electric seems incredibly painful from an infrastructure perspective. Don't discount the eyewatering cost and physical size of infra and switchgear for MW scale power grid ties. So, the fleet is off the road if the grid is down? You think to yourself: ""that's bad"". Next you look at multiple grid providers or multiple ties to separate segments of the same provider's grid. Easy. You come to the realisation that you're probably going to need transformers too. More space. So, what if all your supplies are down? I guess you could eat up most of a modest sized truck marshalling yard with a handful of multi MW capable backup gensets that run on, you guessed it, diesel. Amazing, we've come full circle."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hello John, I never thought I‚Äôd hear the word ‚Äúorthogonal‚Äù on YouTube. Great stuff! Keep it up!"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"EV's aren't for ""being good"" ... they are for ""appearing good"""
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"üòä.  A rational, facts-based analysis and argument.  EVs are  niche vehicles until and unless there is some fundamental change in the tech of the batteries.  Thanks John"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, I really enjoy your content as it is always highly entertaining. I did stumble across this brand that does replace their EV batteries in their EV cars as a kind of a 'hot swap'. I do agree with the liability issues that you mentioned, but I thought you might find this interesting, at least as a concept. https://youtu.be/-5BPL4Nm1q0"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Highly entertaining one.  Having the first delivery be to Pepsi which is likely to use them for hauling Fritos makes sense.  They can fill up an 18 wheeler configuration completely full without having much weight.   Hauling things that are going to take up volume rather than weight are perfect if the Semi is as heavy as you think it is.  There are limits to the size of the Tractor Trailer in the US so I don't think that most of the manpower is going to increase that much for the Tesla Semi.   Most loads for Semis are not going to be anywhere near the 80K lbs. limit
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Great video as always John!
To those who want more math calculations on what the Semi could do (based on if all of the presentations that Elon has said are true, Big IF there) then engineering explained did a great video breaking down the math on all sorts of different characteristics."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,I would suggest that those transmissions will be turning around 15% of that energy into heat when the truck is being flogged. So probably need a cooling system for the internal oil supply.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"We will have to 'weight' and see when somebody decides to put one of these things on a scale to get to the bottom of it. But you're right in the fact they have not directly released these figures, they must not be especially proud of the number, otherwise this would certainly have been in the presentation.... I'm still hopeful maybe even if it cannot haul the same load dollar per kg as an ICE, maybe the intangible benefits like quieter streets / cleaner air / reduced dependency on foreign oil and that blue stuff, could be a case for the government to create incentives / other benefits. Or maybe over a year of operation we will get some solid numbers from PepsiCo etc on how the truck stacks up, and whether any reduction in load capacity has been offset by lower running cost. In any case, I always enjoy the straight talk John, but I'm going to remain cautiously optimistic. Thumbs up. ^_^b (emojis are fun)"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, I think you hit the nail on the head in a previous vid, whereby you correctly noted the following: It is heavy industry that is causing the most concern and the most usage of carbon based fuels in our community. Mining, Power Generation, Industry, Locomotives and Transport are the big users and the big polluters, and until we use a cleaner version of power generation, E-vehicles will never be the answer. There are people out there who drive their Kona EV to work and back in the city, and charge up with Solar, (storage batteries or grid power overnight?) but they are few and far between and it only suites a niche group. Bring on Nuclear Power and help to further the cause of the EV. Obviously, as you have said, EJ will need to do more to make these vehicles a success. 20 MW charging - lol. Cheers."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I'm sorry John, but I can't dislike your video. It's spot on. You're not the only Youtuber to come to the same conclusion. The numbers don't lie."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"You're missing a key advantage to fuel vs battery.  The ICE fuel carriage burden effectively is only half of its nominal weight.  Why?  It all goes out the tailpipe on the trip, and on average the dead load is only half the mass you started with.  A pound of battery, on the other hand, is twice the effective weight of a pound of diesel, because you carry it every mile of every trip."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I think these Semi-EVs will have a niche market where there are/is a pollution reduction mandate. Example: Port of Los Angeles has rules about diesel trucks idling, ships not using their on-board power system, ect. I see these Tesla semis running between the port and the warehouses/terminals inland. That's now a huge amount of traffic in the SoCal. Will the EV Semis be good for long-run, heavy loaded trucks.... not so much."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"While I thought the same thing regarding account for engine and transmission and such in the weight calculations, I'd also watched Thunderfoot's video where he'd estimated the battery mass based on the mass of an existing Tesla battery pack rather than some energy density number. His estimate was about 2 tonnes more than yours which I'd estimate as more than what you'd save by removing the diesel drive train and replacing it with electric motors. At the end of the day, this is all educated guesses and I'd guess that both you and Thunderfoot are likely within the ball park of possibility - especially with those photos and lack of disclosure on actual load capacity."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Feel like I‚Äôm listening to my old man 10 years ago go on about how stupid hybrid vehicles were until he drove one. 
10 years from now and we will look back at diesel trucks and think thank god they are gone. So many parts that can go wrong and need maintenance. Good bye to the mess and pollution."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Speaking with my eldest lad today, who drives road trains carrying fuel (ie dangerous goods), there‚Äôs a point you did overlook in favour of the internal combustion engines trucks versus electric trucks.
The fuel tanks on the internal combustion engines truck typically will be around 1200 litres, let‚Äôs call it 1.2 tonnes near enough.
The further you travel and the more diesel you consume, your GVM decreases as you burn that fuel. You could ostensibly be 1.2 tonnes less GVM when you arrive at your destination, purely by the reduction in liquid fuel in your fuel tank. So the further you go and the lighter your fuel tank weight, as you consume the fuel, the more fuel efficient you become.in transport cost per tonne of payload delivered.

This doesn‚Äôt occur with the weight of the electric battery. It weighs essentially the same at the start of the trip as it does at the end of the trip, the released / consumed electrons essentially don‚Äôt reduce the weight of the battery appreciably.
So your ALWAYS paying to shift that battery from point A to point B.
There‚Äôs no efficiency gain as you progress on your trip the way that there is in a semi with its diesel tank as the fuel is consumed.
OK - 1.2 tonnes reduced to Zero tonnes of fuel when the tank is empty at your destination.
So it averages say 0.6 tonnes on average over the whole trip times every delivery the truck ever does in its entire life time of millions of kilometres.
It‚Äôs a huge amount when you factor this in to the profitability of the truck over its service life.
Truck fleet owners are already analysing the costs & potential savings of Teslas new electric trucks - the world over to try & figure out if they can be more cost competitive than their competitors in terms of their new truck capital acquisition costs, & as you‚Äôve already pointed out, the numbers just don‚Äôt add up for electric trucks.
This same point is also valid over the lifetime of electric vehicles as well - it‚Äôs not just trucks.
Thought you might find this aspect at least interesting. üëç"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John. Love your work & I get a crack up listening to you read out comments from some of these imbeciles. But as a veteran Truck driver of 27 years on the road, I would like it if you can investigate a company ‚ÄúJanus Electric‚Äù that has a number of trucks travelling between Sydney & Brisbane with interchangeable batteries.
Would love to hear your thoughts?
Trucker Troy"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Not wrong. Just engineering and scientific facts. You have got my vote John.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"It will be interesting to see how they work out for Pepsi. They possibly have the best use case scenario for electric trucks.
Deliveries from a regional distribution hub to local stores/warehouses, with the trucks returning to the depot after every shift.

The idea of long haul trucking with them is just silly."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Gotta say I love watching your frustrations with people!  That pen took a beating! üòÇ
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I looked to sse if any real world load utilization figures were available , I found figures in the range 47%  ( Denmark) to 63% (UK) . Bulky light loads, trunks routes vs. regional/local distribution etc. So the real world impact of lower electric trucks tare loads for same lorry gross train weight will actually be quite a bit less than Johns calculation based on 100% load utilization."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"People who defend Tesla on that one and grab on to every little calculation to make the semi look good are insane. If the numbers were anywhere close to good, Tesla would've shown them during the presentation. Not showing the carrying capacity during a truck presentation is like presenting a new frying pan and now showing if you can actually fry anything in it."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,And I absolutely loved it John.  Those truck's are a absolutely limited to urban areas.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Regarding battery swapping, Neo (Chinese company) have several car models designed for battery swapping at automatic battery swapping stations and according to the videos on youtube this takes less that 5 minuets. I think their biggest battery size is 100kw so a 10 fold increase on that will take some development but probably not impossible. 
As for the Tesla semi, I stopped believing Musk's BS years ago."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"The ""criticism"" about ""forgetting"" the fuel tank etc.... come on guys, give it a few minutes thought. I also had that come to mind, but after spending 10 seconds googling the weight of an average (full) fuel tank, etc., I quickly came to the conclusion that even if John had ""forgotten"" something, it wouldn't have meaningfully changed the conclusion"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,I'm quite drunk being a Friday night... I'm only half way through watching but I don't think it has been mentioned that most diesel Semi trucks get well over 1 million kilometers without issue. Good luck doing that with battery power. It would cost more than the truck is worth to replace the batteries after they have worn out (think iphone batteries...) Beer time
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,There are already completely automated passenger battery swapping facilities.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I'd be interested in the range variable - stormy, windy, cold overnight shift through hilly terrain requiring fulltime accessory usage of lights, wipers, heater/demister etc ?"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Love your report that you did yesterday, the only thing you forgot was stop and go that that truck will have to do. Hard on fuel hard on energy"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Thank you for entertaining us!! I am not a believer in EV,s in general. Some would have us believe it‚Äôs the gold standard for the future. Here in the US many are pushing for total replacement of fossil fuel vehicles without giving any thought to how we can keep them all charged for daily use. Our infrastructure as it is today could never handle the need required to charge even 25% of the population that purchases an EV. Sadly many have been drinking the ‚ÄúKoolAId‚Äù for too many years. AS an old fart I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to eliminated fossil fueled vehicles in a millennium never mind in a few years. Thanks for your intelligent explanation for those without a brain. P.S. I am not an engineer even though I was paid to do the work of one. No college degree, but lots of ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù which I find to be in short supply today. ;) ;)"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"On the topic of  the mass difference between I.C.E. vs electric, I suspect that it gets worse as you scale the vehicle up in size.  I could be wrong as Tesla is intentionally hiding the specific numbers, however it would make since as there appears to be an inverted relationship in the I.C.E. to electric conversion and the initial starting size.  

As a side note to the dolts that think something is being hidden by the oil industry, take a modern diesel-electric locomotive as and example.  The diesel-electric locomotive was the original hybrid.  Why was that technology not adopted for semi-tractor trailers?  In a competitive industry like trucking and the building of trucks, the first company to put out a working hybrid truck would have made millions. It never happened because it was never fiscally feasible. In all reality, you and I buying cars and trucks and SUVs and CUVs to ""satisfy"" our ""needs"" is NOT fiscally responsible.  Automobiles for the average ""Jack"" or ""Jill"" are a net negative in life.  However, I still drive my diesel Ram truck so K.M.A.A."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I‚Äôm loving this. Look, I‚Äôm a truck driver, you guys have any idea what it‚Äôs like to spend a week on the road? My days are fraught with unexpected traffic jams, road closure re-routes, unloading delays and parking‚Ä¶ PARKING!!!! Take a gander at any truck stop on the east coast and count the number of trucks on the lot. Now imagine an electrical infrastructure that would power all of those trucks at the same time? Or just sit for a while and watch how many trucks are waiting in line for fuel and how long we wait for that currently. Even if the E-semi works as advertised, this is the fantasy I can‚Äôt wrap my head around."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"John,
Look up Janus electric trucks but be carefull you dont slip on the same BS or fall into the same voids of missing information as the Tesla. This is an Australian electric drive conversion company with an exchange battery system. Keep up the good work üëç"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Love your logic John, it gives me a semi. The good lady wife has an electric ""semi"" and it invariably needs re-charging to get the job done."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,there is a company that does do battery exchange for cars but i dont know how that system works. it might be interesting for your audience. The  company called NIO. love your videos very informative
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,18:20 we¬¥ve already seen the semi haul 21t of highway barriers so you were definitely wrong.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I saw your presentation for the first time today (Dec. 19).  Interesting and entertaining.  Watched about the first 7 minutes.  Something I thank you should make clear so you won't mislead your viewers.  This is about the zero to twenty second time and the power required.  The total efficiency of the system is included in the time.  That includes loss in the conversion from battery through motor, transmission, and power to the wheels.  Given that your calculation for power is correct, you state a requirement of about 750 kW.  you then state a ridiculously large requirement for battery size to fulfill that requirement.  There is an important point left unsaid:  The kW statement implies the energy , not the power.  This in not an unusual mistake, because many people don't know the difference between energy and power.  Power is the product of energy and time.  When you stated 750 kW you should have said kWh, or kilowatt hour.  The 20 second POWER is only 20 seconds divided by  3600 seconds   times your 750 kW, or just over 4 kWh from the battery over that 20 second interval.  Given a 100 kWh battery and neglecting any battery charging for regenerative braking, etc.,  this would allow for about 25 of the zero to sixty ""runs""."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,You are a perfect antidote of all the BS going on in Automotive world
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Often wondered what difference was turns out my guess was pretty good as i figured it was about 15% 
I can maybe swappable batterie packs for class 8 trucks but i shure don't want the job of designing all the quick disconnect for hot liquid and amp dc disconnects"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,I love the smell of facts and science in the morning! Great work John.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"When people were saying they would buy an EV when it had an 800km range and would recharge in 5 minutes, the joke was that they must be transcontinental emergency trombone repairmen.
The Musk Semi does have two use cases. One is transporting light but bulky goods like crisps (bet Pepsi doesn't use it for bottle only loads). The other is white goods and furniture distribution, another bulky but not very heavy load. There's probably enough of a market there for the number Tesla will actually make.
Since I just read in Bloomberg that Tesla is reducing output and, humiliatingly, have had to get a top bod from Shanghai to go and sort out Texas, I suspect demand will exceed supply for a while."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Been off the channel for a while (not for content reasons), came across this video, reminded me how entertaining and educational your videos are. Missed you, man."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Great production as always John!  First Tesla semis are being delivered to Pepsi for their Frito Lay division (snacks/chips).  Pretty sure you‚Äôd never hit max payload with this commodity, so that won‚Äôt be an issue for them. It will be interesting to see how this works out.  Tesla released a  video of a fully loaded semi traveling 500 miles, so, even though we only know the weight of the entire truck, not payload, the truck easily made it."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Gee call me slow but even I knew when you said GVM that you included motors for ICE and Electrons for EV. But the last comment about swappable batteries is pretty true. We have an Aussie company that is retro fitting old prime Movers with electric motors and swapple battery packs ( around 500Kms per battery pack). I believe its still in Test and Dev mode. The plan is to set up swap stations along the Hume and Pacific. 

While not new EV more of a conversion it looks interesting and different. Not sure how it performs on the GVMs"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"20:10 love your work John. Disagree with you on this topic, but you are absolutely right about how media manipulates information."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Great video John. I can vouch for inverters being heavy as an industrial electrician.  Large inverters over 100kW are usually modular.  1 module is the rectification from AC to DC (which is not required on an EV). The other output modules are connected in parallel.  The number of modules depends on output rating of the drive. The modules usually require at least 2 people to remove and are usually mounted on wheels or a trolley system.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I disliked. ..  just for you, John.  It felt wrong.  But all good things do, im sure you will agree!
You're a legend, Old Mate.  Keep them coming.
Incidentally wouldn't it be amusing to see a Telsa electric rig pulling a petrol powered refrigerated trailer.  Surely THAT is worth an emoji?"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Nice one John as usual. I cannot imagine how expensive it would be to put in fast chargers for say just even  ten EV trucks. It must be way beyond a freight operator's budget when he is already working in a very competitive business. Here in WA, even with our cheap gas we have power supply issues. The WA government is planning to pay high power using companies to go on standby to keep the grid viable. Fast chargers would be the only option otherwise he would need heaps more trucks to cover the ones on the slower chargers."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"After being in the transport industry for over 40 years, I can see a case for an electric truck for local work doing light work. But that is all."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"he's still wrong , but he is hilarious, like always :)"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Good take John. For me I think the best futur will be to push more and more the railway and maybe having EV for last miles delivery. It's what Switzeland is doing for the railway (puting trucks on train), it requires more planing and a political commitment...
Beside what Musk was saying in 2017 (""it beat trains""....) With a enelectric train you don't require batteries :) and In theory you can charge short range EV trucks on the train... 
I'm also quite interested about the testing happening in Germany with Ev trucks using electric catenary on a highway to recharge/power EV trucks  I don't know if it can scale but on paper you exchange the range, don't have to carry larger battery.... 
But for the rest i don't care EV my main concerne is C02 emissions and worldwide transportation (cars, trucks, aviations, boat, trains... ) Account for around 16% of the global emissions... So it's a ""small"" problem.. juste a not that in some country like in AMERICA this number is higher... I guess it's even higher in Australia but don't have any data to backup my claims none the less it doesn't mean that Western in particulary have to reduce C02 emissions in the transportation sector."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,12:50 I appreciate you acknowledging you were wrong on something
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"john...i want to add something that has been bothering me about this as well as the cargo measurements of suvs.
something that has irritated me since seatbelts became a penalty under THE LAW.
seatbelts a must...but motorcycles are ok.


don't get me wrong, i don't want anybody takin my bike away, but still want government karen types wiped from my life.

so, when a car is run along the pull line by the pulley at approx 35/40mph into the ""brick"" for frontal testing, shouldn't the additional 2,000 pounds of battery eviscerate the front end and interior passengers from the violence with the added weight?
how can the extremely high added weight still be accounted for in this structure testing?

i saw a recent video where they are actually improving the ability of these pullies to get EV battery powered vehicles up to speed in order to test.  they are difficult to get to 40 mph in the testing lab's limited space.

same with my SUV cargo. how can they legally measure cargo space above the rear seat without accounting for the beheading of all rear seat passengers in any front collision?
a sorta fence or gates should be required to count or add cargo above the rear passenger's heads and seat!"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hey John, you conviniently forgot to mention the wireless phone charger as well, which is in my opinion is also a game changer in the semi."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, I think you have missed two things. Firstly, 15% more trucks also means 15% more insurance. A big cost for transporters. Secondly, with so much additional weight in the truck itself, getting a legally acceptable loading inside the truck might be a problem."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"you might be right about the weight, but from what I've seen on youtube (i.e. I'm an expert), trucks are rarely loaded to max weight. the tesla semi is still fiction and I'll be surprised if it's ever available for purchase."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I'd be curious if the Tesla Semi would actually get the 500 mile range at maximum weight capacity. If the launch truck's trailer volume was full of potato chip packets in cardboard boxes stacked on pallets it wouldn't be anywhere near a full weight load (so range could be significantly lesser if haulage-weight loaded was the maximum allowed). I could see an opportunity though, where they are used for shorter distance haulage of shipping containers from ports to warehouses. Many of these trips are through populated areas and less diesel fumes in city streets is a win. Keep up the good/entertaining work -have been a fan of the channel for many years."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John. 
I enjoy these factual explanation videos. Please keep it going.

While I agree with the truck being implausible for long haul operations due to the mass of the batteries, is there a useful case to be made for short haul trucks? 
Eg. A manufacturer moves packaging from it's local plant out to several local customers  sheds located 20 to 50 kilometres away. The prime mover is often waiting and could be charged while the  product on pallets is loaded or unloaded.  These large sheds are often 40 to 60 thousand square metres in size and large enough to supplement the charger with a few cells on the roof.

My own personal experience with anything battery powered is that people are shitheads and don't bother to plug them back in to help the next poor bastard."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Made me laugh when tesla told us so many stats and figures apart from one the amount of cargo it can pull. By my guess at best its 50% less the the diesel truck 8-8tons to 16-23tons of a traditional trucks
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,I can't wait to see how they try and spin the numbers when they do finally come out. I have read a few comments about swapping batteries. Lets say that works you will need say 2 batteries per truck and a 4-5 ton battery is going to very expensive and further run up the cost of running these trucks.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"These Tesla semi jokes just keep getting better. I highly doubt one can achieve the proclaimed range at full highway speeds and in general, no truck driver needs a 0 to 100kph time like that."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"John. Can you do a side by side breakdown of a Battery Semi, ICE  and a H2 fuel cell semi with the same love and attention that you did with the Tesla Semi?"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"One other advantage of an electric drive train is that it's vastly more efficient than an ICE. ICE turns about 20 to 30 percent of the energy contained in fuel into motion. The rest is turned into heat which is great in winter, but during other seasons wasted. An electric engine is about 50 to 70 percent efficient and it is of course much quieter. The latter reduces stress on the driver and the neighborhoods these trucks roll through. The problem is still the battery which is relatively heavy and still isn't as energy dense as hydrocarbons.

I also do like the fact that EV trucks are safer when you consider the overheating brakes in ICE trucks or the possibility of missing a gear which in turn can lead to a runaway truck"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, Interesting calculation on the Tesla truck, thanks. On the subject of driver numbers (80 or 94, etc), I guess this might eventually depend on Tesla developing the tech to support a convoy with only a driver in the first truck and one or more driverless follow-the-leader trucks. And much much later, perhaps no drivers at all."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"The highlight of my week is watching you respond to the mathematically challenged , the technically illiterate , and the severely Dunning - Kruger effected . I can not , in all good conscience , give you a dislike ."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,The best part is the approx. 25Mw service needed twice a day. Perhaps need to use diesel generators.
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"It will take 8 hours to charge and can hold 1/2 the cargo capacity of a normal truck.

EVs problems are really magnified with trucks"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Hi John, 

I'm in logistics and just had a thought experiment (brain fart you can call it), mind you it is 4th beer already so the thinking process is slightly influenced and English is surely not my first language.

I would like to continue discussion on the EV Semi topic a little more if you don‚Äôt mind.
There are 2 aspects from both of your related videos that I‚Äôd like to share an opinion on:

1. Truck's capabilities alone may be enough for some to make a business case out of it. Explaining my logic:
- Not all rigs are loaded to their max capacity, in fact many loads of goods ‚Äúlinehauled‚Äù interstate in AU reach limit of trailer's available volume way sooner before they reach the weight limit.
- Truck drivers in AU aren't supposed to do 800km in one go regardless due to COR rules and regulations in a country.
Even if we say that an average speed during an SYD to BNE was 80km it would be over 11h of just driving time and to make it legally driver will probably have to do a series of stops on the way.

Lets take a scenario where business moves full semi load BNE to SYD and back loading approx 13t per trailer.
Due to a lack of data from testing electric trucks on AU roads let me use Tesla's data from US and your calculations on truck's and trailer's key weight perimetres: 19t Truck & trailer, 18t payload
- GVM of a loaded truck will lower its max capacity by 5t. This will increase distance most likely to the point to make it between 2 points on one charge
- no extra drivers or overheads are needed in this case, the same number of trucks can handle the job in the same timeframe.
- maintenance cost is likely to be on par with diesel but will have to spend more on tyres as truck is still heavier on a road compared to diesel, this is likely to be compensated by difference in diesel vs electricity costs
- battery range may lower over the time, but can be compensated if charged a little during driver's mandatory break stops
- all of the above is of course only working if an entire infrastructure to support all elements of the movement is in place and business uses fastest charging methods available

All I'm trying to say is that if we forget about all else and just focus on diesel vs electric, it may make sense to go electric in some cases.

2. Real Life
I'm in absolute agreement with you that out of all technologies available to us at the moment, li-ion battery powered trucks do not seem to be the best. And agreed with all of your points:
- infrastructure sucks
- huge demands on greed if technology goes in masses
- there is not enough lithium available to the market already and projection for the trend is to continue
- huge masses of vehicles have huge effects on efficiencies, roads and tyres
- there are simply no real trucks available yet to even compare real world numbers

But there is no other energy source technology for transport getting developed so quickly and so aggressively at the moment around the globe as battery powered one.
If the trend is to continue for another 10+ years it is hard to imagine those big players in a market to back off from it unless we (as a whole human race) will be unable to source elements required to support the technology or some other major crap happens.
By this I suggest that all of your points are absolutely right but you may want to try a bit harder to find a room in our world for an EV Semi truck and it‚Äôs real world application as despite you, I and facts are not agreeing with it, they may still continue building them.

2 more beers down now making it a six pack. 
First time I‚Äôm doing a comment on youtube ever

Cheers

2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Please note: We DO KNOW the weight of the semi trailer!! It is 20,000lb according to Tesla's own PR. That is 3000lb more than the average semi in the USandA. We know this because Engineering Explained channel noticed that Musk was bragging about the acceleration of both the tractor alone and  tractor+trailer at 80,000lb, (5s and 20s respectively) so by simply comparing the times you get 20,000lb according to F=Ma. Great spot by that guy.
...So to those dullards who think the Tesla Semi is going to be lighter - Musk is either BSing you about the accel, or the semi is actually18% heavier than the average semi according to his own data."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Just scanned the first 100 or so comments which were all, John you're so wonderful, 100% correct, what a bunch of sycophants.
Only wish I could find a decent argument against anything you said."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Not all shipments are  based on weight, some are on volume or a formula that balances both.  I'd suggest Frito Laye would be one of those take up a lot of space while not weighing much type of commodities and probably not max the gross weight."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"I really enjoyed that explanation of the liability of changing batteries.... Worth watch after minute 23.
I learnt something, thanks"
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"To the TeslaSemi believers, remember that on Battery Day, those breakthrough 4680 cells were targeted to power the CyberTrucks & TeslaSemis initially?
Well, guess what, they're fitting them to Model Ys because they're the best-selling Tesla model available.
I'm a positive person, but I can't help thinking that those 4680 cells that were being churned out like Mars Bars in the presentation, aren't yielding 100% quality, so fitting them to a Model Y is guaranteeing that they won't be maxing them out on such a light (by comparison) vehicle."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"At 800km‚Äôs range and class1 the cost advantages of this truck(and shorter range variants) will kill most of the ICE trucking industry stone dead.
The only thing holding it back will be Tesla‚Äôs inability to manufacture enough trucks and charging infrastructure.
So don‚Äôt expect the Tesla to run rampant in Australia any time soon."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,Love your work JC‚Ä¶
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"As a truck mechanic, working on a Mercedes truck vs a Scania, Volvo or Isuzu, parts availability is worse, service is worse and more complicated to repair. Tesla's repair model doesn't work with trucks given most trucks are repaired in fleet workshops. 
What suspension and brakes does the Tesla semi run? If a truck smashed a mirror off, how quickly would I get a new one? Otherwise the truck is off the road for weeks because you can't but parts from then and you need to book it in to get replaced with a three week wait. No thanks.

Or the windscreen, the new gen Scania screen is 1500 vs old gen at 400~ same with the fm V2,v4 vs new gen FM."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"Some use cases, probably like Frito-Lay, may fill the volume of a truck without approaching the max weight.  Maybe the math works out in some use cases, even though it doesn't work out in the general case."
2,b-TUfTwWdHM,"But there is heaps of room in the trailer part of the semi trailer to fill with batteries and inverters, and still reserve the 6x4 box trailer it tows for freight."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Buy a set of TuxMat as a last minute Christmas Gift! http://tuxmat.com/thestraightpipes
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I appreciate the honest dialog on Canada's charging infrastructure. I wish more American car reviewers did that in their car reviews.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"i like that Audi is designing their EVs to look and feel like a normal car rather than going hyper minimalistic or hyper complex, and like other manufacturers are doing, i think making EV versions of normal ICE cars is the best way to go aesthetic wise, as one of the major turnoffs for me when it comes to EVs are how basic a lot of them look."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I rarely use my frunk but I feel like it's an absolute requirement. Extra storage space is always welcome and it shows the company put thought into the design instead of just throwing batteries in a ICE platform
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I own an EV and I really appreciate you guys calling out the charging infrastructure. The fact that Tesla, a single company, is getting it right vs. all the competition should be embarrassing to legacy auto makers."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I like that you guys speak about charging problems



- EVs are big decisions.. cool to have the good and ALL the bad in the vids"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"This is a shame to see that the charging infrastructure around Ontario still has a long way to go.  Not sure about the situation in British Columbia, where I visit fairly often.  As someone who lives in California where EV chargers are virtually everywhere in the cities, suburbs and frequently available even in many rural areas, it's easy to forget that charging infrastructure is far from being guaranteed whenever you drive away from home."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I have a 2019 Audi E-Tron that I love.  I got it used and it was a good deal.

The range is terrible, yes, but you need to drop the ""full tank"" mentality. You can charge at almost any destination.  So you're never at the bottom, never completely full.  It helps that I live in Vancouver which has a lot of chargers which I realize isn't a reality for everyone but it works for me.  The car is super luxurious, drives like a dream, has tons of room and looks great.  It is super heavy so it doesn't feel as nimble as other German cars but it is still very comfortable."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I‚Äôve driven the ID4 I thought it was a pretty nice experience tbh plus the turning radius was insane
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I'm all in for daily EVs, but that lack of a useful charging network confirms the pont on The Grand Tour Season 2, Episode 1, ""ICE is the Past, EVs are the future, but Hybrids are the present üßê"" Also I really like how the Audi look like EV versions of normal cars as it should be :),"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,The problem is Ontario.  We took our Bolt out to eastern Quebec this summer and it was like time traveling to the future.  Way better charging infrastructure and reliability.  Hit problems only when we returned to Ontario and realized we needed to think about route planning again.  You should do a review in QC!
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I think it's a nice looking car. Far better than new BMW models. I think it's a handsome svelt car that is understated in it's ""EV-ness"""
2,i3wip4SUM-o,The Straight Pipes should start their own charging network in Canada.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I really wanted the Q4 but Audi ditched their reservation system so dealers here in the PNW are marking them up $5-$10k. The equivalent Q4 to the ID4 I wanted would've been $17k more after the cheapest markup I could find. And that's before taxes. I just couldn't justify that.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I use my frunk all the time on my R1T. I think the powered hood is definitely the barrier to using the frunk.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I love the design, makes me think about the a2 if it looked good."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"VWG and Hyundai/Kia and maybe others have these regen adjust paddles. I haven't used it but my inclination is that I'd hate this. It's too fiddly. Much prefer regen to be handled via a dedicated setting or just tied to the drive mode, and I'd prefer a standalone 1pd toggle. Set and forget."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Personally would go for a Skoda Eniaq if I had to choose a model from the MEB platform
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Nice video. I just can't get down with coupe SUVs but I'd like to get a hold of one of these and review myself!
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"This literally has the same power as the ID.4 AWD but is slower than the ID.4 because it is heavier. üòÇ At the same time, the RWD ID.4 is cheaper and has more range while still being faster than the average compact suv. Not everyone needs more performance and instead may place more value on price and range. I appreciate criticism but it should be balanced. This sounded like 2 guys who don‚Äôt know what they are talking about, you can do better. üòâ"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I don‚Äôt own an EV but I am curious about the day 2 day of owning. This is the best video I have seen so far on just what it is like.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"A humble request: when you do an EV review, can you talk about whether it has an EV route planner and how good it is?"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I love electric cars and even bought a 2016 E-Golf that had a range of 82 miles. We could never find a working charger and had nothing but anxiety.  Until we have more chargers and charge that actually work, I pollute again."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"""ID.4 is way too slow"" Dude, the AWD ID.4 has the EXACT power ratings."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I really wish our respective governments (US and Canada) would have worked with the auto and power industries to set up working, national charging networks BEFORE they required manufacturers to start making EVs. But that would have been logical, and governments don't work that way..."

2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I DONT understand all the hate with the ID4. I drove with my friend from Florida to Myrtle Beach(500 miles) in one and it was amazing. The infotainment didnt have any issues and since he was an actual OWNER, not someone testing it for a few days, he had gotten used to where everything was in the infotainment and there were few if any slowdowns. I believe they've also updated it since then with more speed. Also suspension wise, it was great. Stiff on twist curves and soft but firm over bumps. Its very solid riding. Was super quiet and in particular it had amazing headlights that were great for night driving. We had to stop and charge it 2 times on that trip and each stop was about 30 minutes or so but it was pretty much just plug and play. He plans to hold onto it even after the warranty expires, and if I was in the market for an EV i would definitely look over the ID4. I think you guys are being more than a little unfair to that car. I've seen a ton of them all over my city and  the owners seem to be happy. Doug Demuro seems to agree on that as well."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"People don't use frunks in most cars because you have to open the hood and then open an additional lid below it. I use my frunk in my model 3 all the time for stuff I don't want people to get to if they were to break the glass, and also for take out or leftovers (so the smell doesn't permeate the cabin)."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,That engine sounded epic!
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I use my frunk and it stores my tools, snow brush, air compressor, charging cables.. that way my trunk can be used for anything else.. vehicle related supplies go in the frunk.. I know quite a lot that love using it.. as for our charging infrastructure it does need to be improved.. we need more gas stations to be involved to start converting some spots for EVs and possibly reduce their gas pumps as the switch in vehicles continue."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"when he said there's guilt attached to charging, i felt that"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Has anyone figured out WHY these chargers have such a high failure rate? *CERTAIN* networks are reliable and maintained. 

Feels like these chargers are set up by the same type of contractors who pave public roads: overcharge, do a rush job right before the deadline, use less material so that it'll need to be redone in half the time it is supposed to, and have a very loose definition of ""smooth"""
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Curious to see how his compares to the Benz eqb and lexus rz450. Are you guys driving the eqb soon?
2,i3wip4SUM-o,The id.4 definitely had my eye but I like this a lot too. Would love an all blacked out version
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Sorry to hear you guys continue to have issues with charging infrastructure. Here in California I've having zero issues charging my i4 M50 at Electrify America
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Damn charging in Canada sounds frustrating af
2,i3wip4SUM-o,380 km from a 77 kW battery pack is really inefficient. Kia EV6 will do 450km on a similar battery capacity and is also a bit more powerful.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Great looking car, great features, great review too but,  just by a gas car and be done with it.. lol"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I had no idea they were using capacitive buttons in cars. My entire screen on my 2013 Kia Soul is a capacitive touch screen and it is the single worse tech I have ever used
2,i3wip4SUM-o,After listening to your review it makes me wonder why anyone would want an EV? Just baffles me that they buy them at a higher cost just to save money on gasü§îü§î
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Every single automaker needs to adopt NACS for charging asap.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Guys, if the battery is cold af and has a high SoC, you don't get max charging speeds. One additional note though, VW/Audi isn't shipping battery preconditioning yet, so even you navigate to a charger, the battery isn't heating up properly like the systems in a BMW, Mercedes or Tesla are already working."

2,i3wip4SUM-o,Best part of driving my 4xe is parking in electric charging spots!
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Hey @thestraightpipes related to the charging, I see the Isolationtest is failing, this is actually an issue with the car's communication with the charger, it seems something is wrong with the Audi. It is very likely a software bug (my best guess is that Audi did very little testing in NA markets related to charging...)"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,The charging situation is enough said!

Jakub is completely right. Coupes are for cars. Get the regular SUV body style and room, or get yourself a nice etron GT. This just looks goofy."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Nice review keep up the good work Yuri and Jacob
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"The majority of EV buyers likely live in a large city and will not encounter any issues with charging stations. Do that many people drive cross country where a charging station not being available at every corner like a gas station is reason not to by EV? Unless one lives in a flyover area, charging will not be an issue"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,silent but deadly.... rather have my F type tho
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"It sucks that nobody can get it right, like hats off to tesla the fact I haven‚Äôt had a single issue with superchargers in the 5 years of ownership is so amazing I‚Äôve taken it to Florida 8 times and been to over 100 superchargers. when I hear these issues other EV‚Äôs are having I understand why people don‚Äôt want an EV  But why aren‚Äôt people calling these companies out more?"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Frunks are awesome. But no automaker makes them convenient to open or large enough space to add more than one bag. You have to use either an app or on the screen. A button would be great. Hide it in the grill or the logo.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Omg they made it look like a Ford Edge. That is hilarious.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"When I drove a PS2 for a while the fronk was perfect for leftovers from restaurants. I never eat them, for starters, and I never smelled them in my car! It was perfect."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"The audi e-tron gt is ""coupey"" (completely different price point though üòÇ)"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"@1:11 the bar on ID4 is set so low that basically anything else is better, wow ü§£ü§£ü§£ I like these guys"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"GM says it is going ""all electric"" by 2030. Let's see...that's ca. 7 years from now. And the charging infrastructure is pathetic. 

So if there's going to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new EVs on the road in seven years, how will vehicles recharge?

Yes, many do it at home, but then there's ""range anxiety."" Also, and perhaps most important, there is no way the existing electrical grid can support so much daily charging. It will be Texas 2021 all over again."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Audi makes great looking EV vehicles maybe the best looking
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Re: Boost - it's just Physics.  As the battery SoC decreases, the battery pack voltage drops. The same current (Go pedal) with a lower voltage = less power. So...state of charge drops -> Volts drop -> Amps drop. All that means less power (Watts). Watts = Amps * Volts"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Just go and buy the GV60 or the GV70e. Or just get a fully loaded Ioniq 5\EV6 for less money and get the tax rebate.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Tax credit for installing a home charger would help.
Plug in a night, full tank in the morning."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,What a nightmare charging these ultra heavy vehicles is.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"out of the MEB SUV's - get the Enyaq - it rivals the audi in terms of build quality, interior style and ambience, has more space, is more efficient, and looks better (which is pretty subjective)"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Here in Europe everything is an option with Audi so I got frustrated and ordered a Polestar.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Great Review!! Really appreciate the new titles you are using now a days :)
2,i3wip4SUM-o,It looks like a Edge Platinum. I have the ST lol.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"*""You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them.""* ---Michael Jordan"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"You should address those huge panel gaps between hood, headlights and bumper. It looks hideous and it's the only place in the entire car with that big panel gaps. New car that already looks like if it was poorly fixed after an accident."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Don‚Äôt like your cheesy tire adds but that would be amazing if people started to understand how much tires play a role in the handling of their car. They probably won‚Äôt still but I can hope we are progressing
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Should I get this or a Kia Soul?
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Charging overnight at a house w/garage on lvl 2 is seemingly the only scenario where an electric car makes sense.  Sucks.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Liftback sedans with 8 ground clearance should be the future
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Awesome video!, would you guys be able to review the new Mercedes EQB 350?"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Yessuh üí™üèæüöÄ love the content y‚Äôall keep it comin
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I love you guys‚Ä¶ but as cad reviewers I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre throwing around terms like nobody uses frunks, or that other EVs have ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù. Wtf guys come on. Not giving extra storage (that we actually use all the time) or skimping on power is pure laziness and makes the car worse. If this car HAD those things, like the perks of a nice big storage area up front and some fun power, it would be a really appealing car to way more people."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Skip the ID4? Lol it‚Äôs literally the same car except for a nicer interior, and it costs like $12-15k more than the ID4. If you can live with the ID4‚Äôs interior, just get that and save the $$$‚Ä¶"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I'll get an ev when they make a $25k 300mi range compact. And charging comes easier. So never I guess.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Ah this is how the id.Tiguan might look like.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,finally a video i like to watch again. been checkin this channel so often ^^
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Thats the thing about charging stations. Half the time they dont work seems like
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I am sure no EV fan at all, basically because, if you look into it, they are more greenwash than actual green! Just the fact, that Volvo published the fact, that it cost half a time more energy to produce an EV over an ICE car on the same platform and considering the fact, that no car ever use as much energy in an entire lifecycle, as it cost to produce. If you want to do something for the environment, buy an old energy efficient car and maintain it well. That said, fair has to be fair, and most EV owners do not rely on the public charging infrastructure on a daily basis at all. They mostly use that on holidays or longer trips generally, but otherwise homecharge on a charging plan. Here comes the next damaging issue for EV's though, especially in the engineered energy crisis here in Europe: Gas prices has gone up 50%, but is now on the way down again, while for some bizarre reason electricity prices has doubled and has shown no downturn in development at all! That on it's own is a huge argument for not paying the premium for an EV over an ICE car in my book."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Guys, PLEASE keep calling out these Canadian EV charging companies! As an EV owner, I want them to feel shamed into providing better service. Seems to work with the Out of Spec channel in the US. I haven't had that many issues like you guys have, but it needs to get better."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"9:03 yes, sequential indicators are nice but they're red so they're unacceptable.  Indicators are amber, full stop."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,The problem of this car is that the Cadillac Lyric exist and destroy this car in every aspects.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Anyone that watch the first 4 min can understand 1 of the main reasons Tesla will keep kicking ass in EV cars for a couple more years.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"Until I can get ~400 miles of range, even in the cold.  And, less than 15 minutes charging time to 80%.  I'm out.  Ain't nobody got time for that."
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"1:35 I hope Yuri means ""we did that"" as in automotive journalist, whom rightfully gave VW shit for having the capacitive garbage. If not, I hope that's sarcasm/joke, otherwise that's sounding borderline narcissistic there eh? :D"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,That‚Äôs a good looking Ford Edge.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"It‚Äôs strange that Canada, being such a progressive country (healthcare, all that) doesn‚Äôt provide a strong network for EV charging‚Ä¶"
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Bring back round steering wheels.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,You don't feel sick? Neither do we. We buy fast cars to look good. Not to slam our heads and  give us headaches üôÑ
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"I need one with a black ""grille"""
2,i3wip4SUM-o,I drive an Hyundai IONIC EV 2022 in Norway and have never had any problems with charging
2,i3wip4SUM-o,Your title says 2023 but it looks like the 2022 model with the 10.x inches display Vs the 11.x display in the 2023 model. Can you please confirm? Thanks.
2,i3wip4SUM-o,"If y‚Äôall helped get rid of the capacitive touch buttons on VW‚Äôs, can y‚Äôall do the same for that stupid push button shifter on Hondas?"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"You need to bend the level sensors because you've lowered the ride height and the compressions throw it. 
Also to disable  the dampers pull Fuse 13 in Interior fuse box. 
Go into VCDS and uncheck DCC from Can Gateway. 
Then go into ABS and uncheck bit 7 in Byte 27. 

Everything will then work as normal. Good lap!!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,The facial expressions say it all. What a kick ass lap that was.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Misha looked like a proud dad, cool driving.and cool content"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Insane to see his progress, he tossed me around in the UP once or twice but this is on another level. Can't wait for the season to start again and maybe pay another visit with him, this lap was awesome!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Misha reactions in this one are EPIC !!!!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,For most laps I‚Äôm left thinking ‚ÄúMisha could have been quicker‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure about this one! That man knows his car and it‚Äôs limit very well
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Can we appreciate how good the temps were during the lap? Man, this car is a stable MONSTER!!üî•"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Never in my life did I think Misha would think it was too fast ü§£ looks like he had a brilliant time. And damn that man can drive, one of the best laps I've seen on here in a while those cornering speeds are insane. Great video"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Most on the edge lap I have seen in a long time, the facial expressions helped show us where he was on the absolute limit"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Genuinely one of if not the best laps I've seen so far on the channel, really amazing stuff misha ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"How to impress Micha, 1st school yourself on how to drive fast by learning ""The Ring"" until you can go 100% in a slow car, then when you can do that without errors, upgrade to a better car and then continue your lesson learning until once again you know how to drive it at 100%. His practice clearly shows through, a very enjoyable lap made even better because he made it flow naturally, on a lap helped by low traffic levels, no yellows & courteous driving from other TF drivers"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"What a great lap that was! As Misha said, great track use!! That's someone for Apex race team!! Together with the guy in the wheelchair if there would be a way to make it happen!!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Filip has some mad skills. He is driving so clean and fast. He could drive in some racing series i think.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Amazing car, amazing driver, amazing video, keep up the good work!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,the car and the owner are fast as hell! really great driving and the car looks like a massive pleasure to drive
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"He‚Äôs a very good pilot, smooth and efficiently  ! That‚Äôs a gift because many times peoples get stressed out and try to go faster then they‚Äôre capabilities and often they try a correct the trajectory but are to abrupt and that‚Äôs when you loose it,
He was in full control the whole time, didn‚Äôt seemed to be nervous at all just enjoying himself and the machine. üëçüëçüëç"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Looks like a well setup golf matched with a fast driverüëå
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"The instrument cluster is definitely in Christmas mood , lighting up like the proverbial Christmas tree with warnings.."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,this is insane!!  utilising 1000% of the car capabilities...  excellent setup...  Its good to be able to drive like that with minimal traffic!!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,This is an amazing driver. I enjoyed the ride on the screen. Never seen a golf flying over the track like this.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Hey Misha, at 10:45 when you give your thoughts towards the end, you mention certain parts of the track where his entry and exit was perfect etc

would you ever put in short clips from during the lap over your voice so those who aren't as familiar with the ring can understand which part of the track you are talking about?"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,That was a VERY well driven lap!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,This was a lot of fun to watch. What a smooth driver. And bloody fast as well.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,I love the way you set the screen up with the 4 different angles. Can take the whole thing in rather than picking and choosing. Crazy lap as well
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,A well sorted FWD hatch with someone who knows how to drive it is always great to see! (As well as the many facial expressions of Misha The Passenger üòÜ)
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Definitely one of the most difficult videos to watch. I need to watch it at least 3 more times. 
1) for the lap itself 
2)the barrage of warning lights and messages 
3) Misha‚Äôs reactions
üòÇüëç"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,You know things are serious when you see someone who has a selfie stick with track pass‚ù§
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"It looks like perfect example of time, when only thing limiting your lap times is your equipment. What a pleasure to watch, so smooth... keeping full throttle in tiergarten''s right handed was epic."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Very cool! Congrats Filip! You really have a good flow, great to watch! Congrats for the BIG Upgrade and much fun with you new Tracktool! Always great to see proper driven FWD Cars :)"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"What a lap that was! Well done Filip, some impressive driving man. Judging by his face Misha enjoyed it too ü§£"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"That guy! He was in control all the time, relaxed and confident, his whole demeaner was that of a safe pair of hands, he had race driver written all over him, excellent."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"First breaking zone and Misha is sat in crash position with arms folded tight across the chest. I don't think I've ever seen him this nervous before. Just had to edit my comment after Aremberg... I've just seen Misha more nervous...
Second edit: By the end of the lap Misha had relaxed. Just a few eyebrow raising moments in acknowledgement of driving skill and car set up.
What a lap. Not sure I could have that much faith in my tyres..."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"this was fun to watch, great lap!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,This looked fast AF on video...can you imagine in real life!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"100 kudos for the VW Golf setup and it‚Äôs driver !! Nice smooth driving and cornering speeds !! 
Congrats !"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"8:56  üòè  Nice air.
Big fan of this build and owner now."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,This was so much fun to watch. What a terrific lap!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Gotta love a GTI.  Looked like a really good lap.  Glad you enjoyed it. ‚úå
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"De perfecte stap voorwaarts, met een kleine auto (Sub7Up) beginnen en dan een maat groter. Wat een mooie ronde over de Nordschleife, Filip pakt het goed aan."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,You could make incredible memes with Mihas expressionsü§£
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Some seriously good driving there. Loved every second of it.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"That was nuts and super entertaining, when there's no talking at all, you know they are moving .. üëåüëå"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"F*ckin beast of a Mark 7, beast of a driver and priceless facial expressions of Misha. THX"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Amazing and controlled drive! Loved it!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"That was a great run! I love Golf 7, when you pull out some weight, tune maps a bit and lower and stiffened it a bit it's a great fun car"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"He can drive!!! What a lap, fast, smooth and I enjoyed it so much! I¬¥m still smiling! Congrats Filip!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,I always find it interesting with VAG cars that most people tend to not have the oil temp up in the centre display.  I keep that display on for commuting :-)
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Getting into cars that will travel close to 200mph, with people whose skills you are unfamiliar with, and who are motivated by your presence and the camera to push the limits of the car, is a recipe for excitement, channel growth, and eventually..."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"üëèüèª an awesome lap, guys got some serious nuts."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Wow! Nice driving! Car is set up very nicely and driver knows the car‚Äôs limit. Very impressive!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Una vuelta al limite, intensa de principio a fin. Hubo pasajes asombrosos.
Excelente maquina y muy buen piloto.
Hace mucho no veia una vuelta tan intensa."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Looks fine to me hahahahahahahaha your reactions are like ""wow"" . This guy drives like I do with a controller just brake turn and hammer and I like that he doesn't ride the redline and does mid rpm pulls through corners! That thing has alot of torqueü§Ø"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"amazing lap, Misha was like a proud mantor !"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Wow this guy has fantastic skills. The brakes on the GTI are absolutely phenomenal. I‚Äôm due to upgrade my brakes on my Golf r. Maybe 8 pots. Then use the golf r calipers on my  G40 polo. Need a few adaptations. 
I would love to bring my G40 down and see misha have a play It. 
As always Great video."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Car looks amazing fun, would enjoy this more than the exotic stuff you can really take it too the limit."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,You know you're fast when there's no one behind you the whole course.  How fast would the car be if you could turn traction control off entirely holy shit üòÅ
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,MIsha is using his balls of steel to feel out the car at Schwedenkreuz @4:02 instead of looking himself at the tachometer. Thats some skills.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Wow that's an amazing lap ! Driver looked so relaxed
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Awesome drive. Compelling case as why you start with slow car. Definitely get rid of the ESC. Maybe even ABS, it sounded like it started modulating very early going into Schwedenkreuz 4:04. Assists hide vehicle dynamics induced by the driver by a program handling them. Learning to be your own assists and control or avoid those undesirable vehicle dynamics no matter the conditions is one mark of an excellent driver IMHO.  cayenne or boxster brake cylinder in there might play better with the abs on track if you want to keep it."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Best lap in a while Misha. Love it. Keep up the great work.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"in just one lap, that traction control light blinked more than mine in his entire life time"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Pro5000's doing some heavy lifting.
Congratz to driver. Well driven."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Great driving. And it did't overheat. That's great. :D
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,This car is a monster. This guy is a monster
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Really good! Saw the driver sometimes with the sevenUP on track in the past, wasn‚Äôt driving really fast, but now; awesome driver!!üëèüèª"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Brake,turn, smear, accelerate. A lovely front wheel drive lap :)"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"That`s what I call quality content. Excellent car, adequately modified, and has a capable driver. Invite this young gentleman again, Misha."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Golf wouldnt be golf without all error messages when the soul is leaving the car on that epic lap üí™üí™
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Extraordinary driving.. it kinda remembers me the f1 driver on the m4‚Ä¶ impressive for the owner/driver!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"This guy knows exactly how to drive his car fast, fantastic lap!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,That was a great drive in a well sorted car üî•
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Amazing driving! Such a smooth driver!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"The last part of the track was flyingggg - also the dashboard is hilarious, I had no ideea some of these errors even exist hahaha"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Superb üëèüëçüòÄ  loved this, sure makes a difference when the driver knows what he‚Äôs doing, sounds obvious, lol.üëçüòÄ"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Driver did a superb job of connecting his lines and managing momentum. Impressive.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,WOW! Great lap. Luv'd that driving style. üëèüëè
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Eier aus Stahl und vertrauen in die Traktionskontrolle. Wahnsinn
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,I'm super impressed engine temps stayed planted at 90C
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Great driving. There didn't seem to be much more you could extract from that car on that track even in theory.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,3:29 Again - it is very strange to see the passing in the forward camera from the left and the back view to show that you passed the car from the right. It messes with my brain every time :D
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Damn VW went on strike for this lap. You got ALL the warnings and then some... It didn't even wanna give you accessories at one point, whatever those are. Solid lap though. Taking the golfness out of the golf may get VW's panties in a bunch, but it looks like the party's better that way. Drooling over those AP brakes..."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,I read 238 km/h peak! At 9:00 Wait... What? Did he FLY?!? Is that a professional driver? if not - he should! Stunning.
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Brilliant driving! I admire you! Misha‚Äôs face speaks more than thousand words :-)
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Awesome video. That Golf is a badass build. I too was surprised in the sections he stayed flat through. I didn‚Äôt know Schirmer built Golf‚Äôs!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Holy sheeeet!! Great mad driving, is not everyday you see such a happy and smiley Misha üòÇ"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Now this is how you supposed to drive a GTI üî•
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"At 6:50, Mischa finally relaxes and checks out the quality of the welds on the roll cage above his head üßêüßê"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Superb drive, driver took the car to its limits but well with his own limitations"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Great driver that guy!!! And a great track car too! Your faces Misha tell the whole story without words! ;)
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"This man's car looks very nice! Is it streetlegal like that?
You pulled some funny faces aswell Misha, very enjoyable to watch! 
Thank you for sharing!"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"He's at 9.5 / 10ths darn traction control! 
Love the good vibes"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Question to Misha? What‚Äôs the feeling between being passinger and driver? Are you more tense or scared while in passinger seat?
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"The FWD MQB chassis setup seems to be a much better setup, the haldex system is to on and off"
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Fair to say my man can drive it like he's stole it aggressive like I'd try and drive all the time
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Since you started doing the facial expressions the videos are so much more fun!
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Always good to see a hazard light doing 200klm/hr ü•∏
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,Misha awesome content as alwaysüëå If you could upload the bonnet/hood outside view of this Lap i would appreciate it. üòÖüòÑüôèüôå
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,That was really good. Very positive and confident inputs
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"Hello Again. Wow Misha that was some drive, really enjoyed the lap, great car very good driver. Regards, RichardA."
2,LI0KfBx-S9k,"That smile on Misha's face is priceless, my favorite yt channel!!"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"I have been sponsoring children through World Vision since 1986. They are a great organization, and are usually the first people on the ground when there is a natural disaster providing services to the victims"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Have you checked to see if the throttle position sensor on the accelerator pedal is actually going the the full range?
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Good morning from Minnesota!! Wow what a project! Glad you and all your elves got it figured out! I also sponsor a gal thru world vision. My wife and always find enjoyment in giving goats and other animals as part of our support!  If you do decide to do some sort of support flight count us in!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hope you have finally found the problem with the diesel not being able to allow normal throttle control of the Cummins diesel.  It has taken awhile.  Good thing you kept the smoke in without causing major damage.  Hope to be able to see you in the spring if I can get the repaint of my Sonex Legacy done by Sun and Fun.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Hi Jimmy...never short battery cables (battery disconnected) cause those capacitors can burn some components in you module. Use a ""1 OHM 30W 5% SAND STONE RESISTOR"" to drain the power slowly."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Jimmy, love your persistence and good humor, you are one fine fellow!"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Sealing the roof and all the places it might leak in the future would be good.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"You talk about the crazy animals Darius sees! When I learnt to fly at Titusville, I'm from the UK BTW, one of the lessons over the Everglades, the instructor said to me always be aware of a safe place to land in the woods.
 Woods? Frigging woods? I said. You've got alligators, snakes, bears, poisonous spiders, panthers and fire ants down there, That's a frigging jungle;
 squirrels live in woods, deer live in woods  mice live in woods where  i live."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Instead of replacing the ECU, you could use a low voltage relay with a voltage regulator to power the unit instead.  but replacing it is fine, and is a good clean fix."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,the ecm is in limp mode you need to be able to clear that code the crossing and shorting battery leads out works but sometimes it can take up to an hour to clear using this method also when starting the genset make sure it is not under a load it will pop that fuse every time you could send an email to JH diesel or  JC smith he is not in the area but he is an amazing at diagnosing maybe he could get you heading down the right road he also has a youtube channel J smith projects
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Heads up Jimmy!! You can do it!!!!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"The joys of modern vehicles, so many more things to go wrong!!!!!"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hi Jimmy. It definitely sounds like it is on limp mode. There might be an air pressure leak on a hose somewhere. The computer will stop RPM increase to prevent damage to the engine. Make sure you check all the air hoses for cracks.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,The alternator issue is a non issue. It's the intake heater grid cycling on and off.  It will quit after running a few minutes.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Well I'm certainly glad all you diesel guys figured it out for Jimmy because I was along for thr lesson on this one. Great job. Glad Jimmy your a listening type guy
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"The trouble with disconnecting all the connectors at once is, if that fixed it, then when it goes again, down the road, you will have to do them all over again. For future ref, disconnect in turn, then try. If it works, you know which connector needs fixing."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Glad you found the problem. It was the bus all along! Put that ECM into another bus and call it good.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Boats also go into limp mode after a warning light event. I thought I cooked an engine after my outboard overheated. In that case it will reset after the engine is shut down and restarted.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"JUST CHANGE THE FILTERS. ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILTY THERES ALGAE IN THEM  ,My boat engines idled great when filters were plugged. But would not run under a load."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,this thing gonna look brand new after wash
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,World vision is a great charity. Compassion international is a great one also.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Alternator cycling on and off happens when the grid heater in the air intake cycles which draws heavy amps.. just a Cummins thing.   
Will happen below a certain temp every time you start it."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Alternator won‚Äôt charge immediately on a diesel. Glow plug (air heater) circuit usually pulls it down for 30-60 seconds. Give it a minute and rev it up and recheck voltage. Or the brushes could be corroded from sitting for years in the salt air.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Good morning Jimmy great to see ya on here this morning üåÑ love ‚ù§Ô∏è your videos üòä
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Keeps the smoke in... just love it üôÇ
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,You definitely don't want to let the magic smoke out!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Normal voltage drops after start. The grid heater for the engine. It's the only thing on the RV that draws down that kind of power to dim the lights with the engine started. See it on my old MH.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Jimmy, you‚Äôre gonna need a bigger plane to do thatüò≥üò≥ü§®ü§®
I think you‚Äôre gonna need something equivalent to a DC three or do you see four to accomplish that sort of feat!"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hey brother I love what your doing have you thought about calling Busgrease monkey he‚Äôs a YouTuber famous for repairing all type of vintage and modern buses with engine problems
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Yup, fuel filter wont help. It would surge way up then surge way down if it was fuel filter. This is a electrical governer issue. Text book. Runs great at lower RPM. Its a governer issue. Something is wrong that forces the governer."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hahaha!  I wish you luck with it.  You might send the ecu/ecm out to be cleaned and rebuilt. Might be cheaper then a new one.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hey Jimmy. It's a deasel engine have you checked the fuel injectors. Could be dirty and not spraying enough fuel in the engine for proper combustion.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Hi Jimmy, love your videos, however; I‚Äôm a pilot and look forward to more about your airplanes. üòä"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Love the Stripper comment!!! Fooled ya! Classic! I can't get enough of your videos Jimmy! You make my day! Thanks!!!!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"That check engine lights gonna remain on until the thing turns over once the engine starts it should shut off, but I‚Äôve never seen a check engine light go off until after the engine has been started I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think soü§´.."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,The tps needs to do a count from zero to 100 direct  to the ecm.the ecm needs to talk with the tranny emc via a inter face so that the ecm knows if you are in correct gear before giving you more counts/ power to the engine. Tps are cheap to replace if you can't check it.ecm are not cheap and you can't return  them.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Good job Jimmy üëè
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Glad Steve was right. Thanks Steve.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,check all ground wires after it sitting for a length of time. injection pump is not being conveyed correct commands
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,üôèüôåGOOD ON YOU JIMMY! üôåüôè
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Put electric jell in plugs will help your connections and keep them dry in side plug.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"As a new viewer, I don't know what ""Steve was right"" means. Did you fix it? *confused*"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Is this model cummins drive by wire by any chance? I suspect it is. I'm betting its a throttle pedal issue.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Maybe I missed something, but I watched the vid twice and ""Steve"" was not in the vid.  Who's Steve,
and what part was he holding up at the end of the vid?  He leaves us not knowing the solution except that he had some type of alternator problem. . . . . So I guess Steve is the mechanic in the prior vid, and the bad part is the Electronic Control Module (ECM).  Wish he would have been clear in this video."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Also low voltage can cause problems
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,ECM.s need full voltage to function . When I was a Ford tech we had one issue with a ECM spiting out mulitple codes we checked it the voltage and the the alt was bad replaced the alternator and cleared the codes and it was golden went back to normal no codes. Check the TPS Throttle Position Sensor if you have a bad sensor as you crack the throttle it want send the signal to the jECM it needs and you will run into a lean condition off idle. Its a Variable resistor like a volume switch on a radio . If its bad you will never get off idle and move the coach I know you dont read or reply but I had to try
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Jimmy ! Let the engine run for several minutes, the Alternator won't start charging until the engine runs several minutes."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,CRC electrical contact cleaner. Don't go by looks. I've had many trailer connectors look fine but were corroded. Try cleaning the connections.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,well we all tried to the best of our abilities what could possibly go wrong? be we were all correct though eliminate the different things work smarter not harder.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,I have worked for multiple car manufacturers now and fixing a vehicle over the phone is almost impossible.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"A man after my own heart ""MT.DEW"""
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,You need some Bruce Wilson for this beast to run right.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Diesel engines were better before electronics. Mechanical governor and manual control racks are much more reliable. Two stroke diesels are the bomb.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Jimmy at least it starts fast. Hope it gets going soon.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"So is it fixed?  I wasn't 100% sure by the end of the video that said ""I use your comments to FIX free Abandoned RV""."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Hey Jimmy have you seen the new pop machine that has touch screen. The guy that made that for coca cola the deal was if he makes that they make a new water filtering system that doesn't use filters. He's also an airplane guy. You should look into that and see if you could get some for the village of the kid you sponsor. They made a documentary about it. Pretty cool watch.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Love you, man, your like a good tonic & always put a smile on my face. Watched your video on sponsoring kids in Africa which my parents did some years ago now as they are brown bread, yep dead now it struck a cord. So I was thinking & decided to call you ,""Jimbob "" & if your ever thinking of doing more sponsorship I will send you my bank details.  üòÜ  Serious note fair play to you, Jim Bob Slainte from Ireland üáÆüá™ p.s. You should be a star as you have star quality big time. Happy Flying"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Trust the pros Jimmy
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,there's the problem - if you got a dinosaur stuck in the fuel tank - you need to feed him and get him out
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Just a short FYI diesel‚Äôs don‚Äôt need air. That‚Äôs why you bled the fuel lines.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,You're a solid man and a funny Dude.  I enjoy these muchly.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Steve was right about what? Who is Steve? I thought you were talking with Terry? I did watch the whole video. What did I miss?
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,The 24v cummins is a hybrid throttle system with the vp44 it's mechanical to a electric sensor. The sensor is known to develop a dead spot. Common problem on that system. Apps with a scan tool you can read live data and check the sensor
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Alternator cycling is the intake heater cycling after startup. The intake heater is a big draw. Volt meter will drop and even dim the headlights when it kicks on.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Have you checked the throttle position sensor in the RV that can cause the engine to go into limp mode it happened on a freight liner I was driving earlier last year
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,I can relate to the smoke ordeal! üò≤ü§£ü§£
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Love World Vision and Compassion International.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,My rv got the same engine my injector pump  was shot and ended up replacing the injector  pump and lift pump fixed my issue
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"IT'S GOING TO HELP ANYWAY. JIMMY ON MY RV IF I WERE GETTING THAT SITUATION SIMILAR, THE BATTERIES WERE A COMMON ISSUE BUT THERE COME A TIME WHERE I COULDN'T GET IT STARTED BUT IT WOULDN'T GET STARTED BECAUSE THE GENERATOR WAS ON W WHILE THE MOTOR WAS CRANKING. BUT I GOT IT RUNNING EVERY YEAR AND IT'S NOT GOOD TO LET THESE MOTOR SIT EVERY YEAR FOR A YEAR SO YOU MIGHT TRY THAT TOO."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Jimmy my friend ....some vehicle will rev limit if its not actually driving on highway ...so go on the road
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,This video was released posthumously as Jimmy never made it back from the Bermuda Triangle he went to investigate in the last vid. ü§£
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Jimmy pls use safety glasses when dealing with battery cables etc  anything w a potential spark can go into your eyes ..  be safe brother   üëçüèª‚úåüèªüá∫üá∏üôèüèª   Same when in the planes working on elect
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Instead of clear prop you say "" ALL ABOARD "" for an RV I think . No wait that is a train I think ü§î I don't know what you say for an RV ?"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,If its been sitting a long time there may be old diesel in the bottom of the tank that is fouling the injuctors.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Wait ha ha what did Steve say??? ‚ÄúSteve was right‚Äù??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ I missed that joke!?
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Replace the crank sensor.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,I know something jimmy. It‚Äôs not running right. That I know for sure. I‚Äôm glad I could help buddy‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm a painter let‚Äôs do a custom paint job on one of your planes we could do some flames and some candy colors. If I ever get a plane that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm doing to it.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Jimmy that would be awesome!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,less RV more Airplanes..... Jimmy
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Maybe someone will donate a 2022 Prevost Liberty Coach :)
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Always fun waking up to another Jimmy's World video.... I know you get a CLEAR PROP when you do airplanes.  Not sure what you say on an RV.  Clear roads? :)
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Sweet tea just don't cut it on days like this, gotta dew the ""Dew"". Cheers from Jacksonville Florida üåû"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"I'm starting to think this project is *FUBAR'ed*  Good luck chasing phantom ""I wonder if....."""
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Battery cables together, good joke!

HOW OLD IS THE FUEL??
üòÇü§£ü§£ü§£
You realize that fuel loses its volatility over time.

Bad fuel = low power.
Also fuel filters restrict flow."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Don't let it run out of gas Jimmy...
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,What year is that engine?  2007 and up it will have a ‚Äú DPF‚Äù ( Diesel Particulate Filter) if saturated  the ECM will derrate the engine!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Love how diesel is under the master bedroom.. lol does this mean you wryly love the diesel because you sleeping on it probably clogged exhaust... Look for nest in the pipe maybe snakes try unplugging the exhaust anyplace before the cats. And start it up .
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Find a mint front engine swap it out for a cummins and if the motorhome like a 05 or older no emissions and you will need a Allision trans 7 speed auto you got a great rig with at least double the fuel mileage or more .
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Just a siily idea, check your throttle position sensor for full travel"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,At least it's charging now. Hope it doesn't decide to quit on you.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,You've found an alternating alternator‚Ä¶What a sense of humor!
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Think it's the turbo. You should hear that thing whine even at idle. Without that it won't allow it to go full RPM. I sure wasn't hearing it at all. The way the exhaust was kinda blown off in the last video leads me to believe something catastrophic happened to it. Had a Chrysler with a 2.2L Turbo (not diesel though) and a stuck wastegate took the turbo out and it never ran right afterwards. Blew its exhaust as well.
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,is it not boosting on the turbo ? check for perrished air hoses ..
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Mountain Dew makes everything better
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Jimmy please wash that rv.  ü§£üòÇ
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"Just buy an OBDII scanner, I have a ‚ÄúBlue Driver‚Äù it was $99 bucks and it reads codes and resets engine lights"
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,"umm.. Jimmy, big heart... honored to watch... now did you remember how Amber Heard and Johnny Depp got in trouble by trying to sneak their dog into England... you might have an issue getting the Silver Bullet full of chickens all the way over.."
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,Darius says the crapper is full aka the Porta-Potty on the airplane
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,you need to get Watch Wes Work down there with you with all his crazy laptop connections so he can watch the PCM do its thing
2,xNQo8VC_gR0,World vision is a great organization!!
2,H3IsujmILlI,i am blown away by this car.  What an amazing restoration!
2,H3IsujmILlI,Who would have thought this could happen from a wreck? Simply gorgeous. Well done Mat and all those who had a part in it.
2,H3IsujmILlI,Well done guys. This was one of the best builds yet. I love everything that you have done to the Porsche. Awesome stuff.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"absolutley clinical! amazing restoration!
not too keen about that huge spoiler, i think the standard would have been enough, but I just dig the paint, the wheels and the front. amazing work!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"I've just had the absolute pleasure of watching the build from start to finish, all 8 episodes. The colour looks unreal, and the whole car just looks soooo good. I think this build has to be my favourite. Kudos to you, you've smashed it out of the park! Phenomenal car."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Flipping genius Matt, what a car, what a production, excellent in every way...congratulations buddy, I‚Äôm proud that we finally have a British A list automotive youtuber, Shmee‚Äôs got money, you‚Äôve got balls and talent üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"

2,H3IsujmILlI,It's a thing of beauty Mat - the colour really works! Loved watching this restoration.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Those wheels and the tints just finished it off superbly.

Stonking build mat üëåüëç"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"It looks awesome!!! Love the gt4 style look. I don‚Äôt think I could ever do the gt4 justice with my driving skills, so having a cayman S that kinda looks like a gt4 might be the perfect compromise, awesome looks, good driving and not too fast"
2,H3IsujmILlI,You‚Äôve pulled it out the bag yet again Matt. Looks amazing and should be very proud of yourself and the team.. üéâ
2,H3IsujmILlI,"I've watched all of your builds & this one is by far my favorite... you basically re-manufactured this car from scratch from bare chassis.. and it turned out amazing, looks better than most porches i've seen on the road & I see alot of porches where I live... great job üôå you inspire me... keep up the good work"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Absolutely love this car! What a final finish! Bravo mate.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"That is one hell of a nice car .
Top job Mat.
Everything about it is spot on.
Hat's off to you fella."
2,H3IsujmILlI,Don‚Äôt know anything about cars but binged this whole series in one stretch! So well done and making it even better then it was for the price of the cheapest one available it‚Äôs just a good job!
2,H3IsujmILlI,Wow this turned out so much better than my expectations. You really have a good eye for these builds. Respect üíØ
2,H3IsujmILlI,"This build is truly unreal , you are such a talented enthusiast . Great taste of colours and you don't stop at getting everything right ! Keep it up and can't wait for the next resto ! üëè"
2,H3IsujmILlI,I‚Äôm a massive Porsche fan and this was the best one I have seen you do Thanks It looks SO GOOD MATT !! Question - are you selling it or giving it away or keeping it or what ? Brilliant job and thanks for sharing the full journey
2,H3IsujmILlI,"The Porsche was brought back to life and you guys went above ans beyond to make it justice, beautiful looking,  sounding and just a gem to look at knowing the before and after."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Stunning transformation! Great colours, ride height, exhaust and attention to detail with the roof and the shut lines. Great build Mat & your energy, enthusiasm and optimism are extraordinary and best of all infectious!!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,The quality of videography when revealing the car was next level. Felt like I was watching The Grand Tour! Brilliant stuff.
2,H3IsujmILlI,well done Mat...this was beautiful to watch and enjoyed all the episodes
2,H3IsujmILlI,"This car looks are off the scale, in my mind this needs to be the next Bumblebee car. But is this better than your beloved Aston Martin? Hmmm, it's so close but I think your Aston has the edge imo.    Amazing work once again Mat and co."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Mat, this Porsche Cayman rebuild has to one of your best looking projects to date. The transformation from a crash damaged/wrecked car to a stunning looking GT4 Cayman is next level. Loving the stunning new colour & the lowered stance with the new wheels. Absolutely brilliant! üëçüî•üëçüî•"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"This car came out absolutely amazing! The wheels are perfect! I also can't believe the sound of it. Well done Mat, this one had me worried from the start but you seriously smashed it!!!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Some transformation! Great colour combination and top job on the exhaust - it sounds good now too üëçüèª üòÄ
2,H3IsujmILlI,Love the way this car looks now. Brilliant job Mat.
2,H3IsujmILlI,Lovely build as usual Mat - congratulations!  Could do with some Porsche center-caps to complete the OEM+ look!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Looks mint mate. Honestly tho, everything you do is amazing."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Super sick build! Love the content. Always fun to watch. Shouldn‚Äôt you start factoring in time/labor (at minimum rates, at least) to get a more accurate accounting of the cost for each project?"
2,H3IsujmILlI,What an amazing transformation Matt definitely one of the best builds so far. When‚Äôs the raffle üòÇ
2,H3IsujmILlI,The car looks great!  I‚Äôve enjoyed this series
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Great journey to get to this point, got to love Caymans. I had a Mk1 picked up from Silverstone Porsche as a surprise for my 40th leased for 3 years. One of the hardest things I had to do in my life was hand the keys back 

The Car looks fantastic awesome work loved watching you rebuild and bring back to life"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Proper humble guy that gets the results every time. Thanks for the trust Mat üëäüèª
2,H3IsujmILlI,"I'm a huge Porsche fan, absolutely loved this series - congratulations Mat. Incredible job."
2,H3IsujmILlI,WHAT A FANTASTIC LOOKING CAR ITS SUCH A PIECE ART !!!!!!........GREAT WORK MATT üëç
2,H3IsujmILlI,"So without the expensive paint, body kit and seats, and one or two more details, you could have had a completely rebuilt 718 S WITH an awesome exhaust and some more additional stuff that sounds like THAT for what... 30k?? Insane bro. Awesome build, awesome vids, and I respect the decision to go all out in the end because it was definitely worth it for how insanely sexy the car looks. Bravo."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"The colour looks absolutly stunning! Well done Mat! When you painted it i was doubting the colour, but seeing it finished it just looks amazing! Great rebuild by you and the crew. Love it."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Man, I just found this channel and series this beautiful Sunday and enjoyed every episode so much. Finished part 6 and was sad, that I can't watch more. Refreshed your channel and part 7 is here. I'm beyond thankful :D
Insane job Mat and friends!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"looks amazing, absolutely love the colour! My first thought was that it sounded expensive but I'm sure you've made plenty from all the great videos (Y)"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Loved this build, well done it looks amazing üëç"
2,H3IsujmILlI,this final cinematic was amazing... defo the best looking car so far.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"For me that's  one of the best looking Porsche  out there , hats off to you Matt cant see how you can better that one, well done. üëå
Cheers Pete ."
2,H3IsujmILlI,I love that you show the cost of the builds. I feel like alot of people stop doing it when there channel's get bigger. I'm glad you still show its really good to see
2,H3IsujmILlI,Amazing resto Mat. Keep up the hard work and I hope it inspires many other young lads to get into this kind of work/hobby
2,H3IsujmILlI,Amazing build! Loved watching the progress you made with the cayman! Its a beautiful car!
2,H3IsujmILlI,DAMN MAT!  The car looks amazing‚Ä¶love the color‚Ä¶stance‚Ä¶looks TIGHT!  Congrats!! üéâüçæ
2,H3IsujmILlI,Ooks absolutely amazing. Bet you didn't even think it was gonna turn out that good.
2,H3IsujmILlI,I am in awe of you Mat. You take big risks and put in so many hours and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such entertaining restorations of these cars I could only dream of affording. Absolute class guy üëè‚ù§Ô∏è
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Probably my favourite car you‚Äôve done, it looks absolutely awesome üëçüèª"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Think this has to be your best build so far. The colour and them wheels look amazing. Great job ‚ù§
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Looking amazing, great choice of coilovers and tints"
2,H3IsujmILlI,This was my favorite car build so far this year (on all of YouTube). Love your channel.
2,H3IsujmILlI,Dude you have absolutely outdone yourself on this one... wheel and paint combo is spot on and that exhaust sounds awesome. My favourite car youve done to date. Great work matt.
2,H3IsujmILlI,dude! this car looks and sounds incredible! Nice work!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"I was skeptical when you first revealed the color but seeing it with the wheels fitted outside man it was such a good pick , car turned out stunning this was just an amazing build series"
2,H3IsujmILlI,this car looks incredible! probably one of my favourite cars youve done. that front end just looks mean!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Taste wise, this has been your best transformation! Have you thought about tinting the rear lights? Not too much"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Another masterpiece! Honestly Mat I love the kit, I love the new wheels and I adore the paint job and the colour! It looks amazing! Awesome work!!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Amazing how you restore all these cars like better then new, the love you put in to it is fantastic!"

2,H3IsujmILlI,"Loved the entire series, car came out super clean. Absolutely smashed it mate."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"This car looks perfect, man! Congrats! Also, its hard to see any youtuber finish projects like you do, keep the hard word, I'm excited to see the lambo finished!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Man that colour looks incredible with the carbon accents and dark wheels. I wasn't sold on the wing, but I must say, with the car being lowered and sitting in it's final form, it's really grown on me."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Cracking content Matt!
Incredible build from start to finish üôå
Think this is my fave so far‚Ä¶.."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Amazing. The car , the content and the crew fantastic work"
2,H3IsujmILlI,I wonder how good this car must feel on track with the lighter engine and the added downforce from the body kit.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Absolutely amazing job, hands down one of the nicest Porsche's I have seen!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"The amount of progress this guy can make in 3 months is crazy, love the car and can't wait to see the other projects finished!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,One of the best restorations you have ever done imo
2,H3IsujmILlI,WOW!! What a transformation. The car  looks insane Mat. Incredible  work.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Amazing outcome Mat! Bodykit, colour, wheel etc 10/10. Each time you finish a project I go, thats my fav. This doesn't dissapoint."
2,H3IsujmILlI,Matt you‚Äôve done it again - love your taste on the mods - cinematic footage look on point. Your living my dream dude fair play. It‚Äôs sounds like a Porsche 4 knocker should very  hot car üî• üî• üî•
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Well done, Mat. This car restoration is a work of art. Really enjoy this series."
2,H3IsujmILlI,Mat you do everything so perfect and extra. The new lambo merci will have a second chance at life again.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Wow, best transformation you have done Matt!!!! Really really good, from where it was to where it is now is epic üòéüòéüòé"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Absolutely brilliant üëè  well done Matt ....the best yet.
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Awesome job on the restoration! üëç
I would have used a bit narrower rims and N-marked tyres to get a bit more protection of the edge of the rim."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Mat, that looks incredible, honestly. Well done to everyone who contributed to this build"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Amazing job Matt, really enjoyed watching all the videos. Great job..keep them coming. Thank you"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Impressive work Mat! The only thing holding your builds back now are the tyres!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Great work, it looks amazing! Hard work really does pay off!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"This car!! This build series!! An amazing transformation, keep up the great work!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Amazing work mat! You really are setting the bar now and your progress is crazy! üòÅüëåüèª
2,H3IsujmILlI,This car came out amazing! Amazing Job Mat!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Mat, this is amazing....always in awe of your work and entertaining videos"
2,H3IsujmILlI,Dude the car is gorgeous! Great work with this one and great vid as always .. never a bad video with you ‚úåüèº‚úåüèº
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Matt
The car looks amazing. I love the color and the stands with the new Coil-overs.  You did an amazing job with this one congratulation.  I can‚Äôt wait to see what you build next!!! 

Best Regards 
Orlando from Arizona USA"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Spectacular transformation, that is a stunning car. The decision to paint instead of wrap makes this build next level."
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Beautiful car, it looks so right - what can I say you've done it again!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Good god man ü§§ it‚Äôs perfect. My exact project staring back at me haha you crushed it as always man. So hyped for you to see you finally enjoying it üôåüèº 

As always, stay awesome man ‚úäüèº"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Great Job Mat, you created a stunning Car. Well done all of you! Onto the next one!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,You smashed it on this build well done.üëç
2,H3IsujmILlI,"The Porsche turned out amazing, the colour definitely makes it pop from others and the whole build is amazing. One thing that would have been interesting too see is, if you were able to tint the red part of the taillights black. This is definitely one masterpiece of a build. Looks great!"
2,H3IsujmILlI,This is one of the best rebuild ever! Well done Mat!
2,H3IsujmILlI,Absolutely blown away how good it looks Matt üëè unbelievable job!!!
2,H3IsujmILlI,"The detail and work needed to get this going Mat, one of those baffling ones, i never thought you could ever repair all of that, getting that roof off, jeez, to sorting the radiators and getting the inside right too,  that troublesome left hand side as well, more a headache, but the end result. wowsers. Lot of work but by god what a result."
2,H3IsujmILlI,That car turned out absolutely stunning üëèüëèüëèüëè
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Great energy as always Matt. You guys have smashed, the car rebuild along with the TV production perfectly complimented by your character are always great to watch.
Pat on the backs for all of you guys üëçüèΩ"
2,H3IsujmILlI,"Dude! I watched this over 2 days on a business trip, and at part 4, 1am in the morning you had me thinking of how I could start doing this hahaha! Not gonna happen, but that's how much I enjoyed watching it until then end. New subscriber, look forward to the old and the new. Great work, I love Porsche and this was a job I thought wouldn't make it looking at the state of it in the beginning. Great content, great editing and the short parts are easy on the watching time. Thanks!"
2,Db-bclis12k,"Change my mind; This was one of Teej‚Äôs best vlogs/vids in a while (not saying i dislike others, this was just great to watch). From that awesome intro through the school class test, and watching Calvin fall. I would happily watch this vlog 3x over with a smile on my face. Great work TJ! ‚ù§"
2,Db-bclis12k,TJ and the boys going to become the new Wild Hogs üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,"Love everything about your work TJ, keep it up and Keep Moving Forward!!!"
2,Db-bclis12k,"On the eight day of vlogmas TJ gave to me: a BRG M4 delivery, an intake from Eventuri, an exhaust to make the M4 scream, some pickle ball games with big T, an oversized Christmas tree, another exhaust that sounds gnarly, selling parts to keep the shop clean, and a cease and desist from harley!"
2,Db-bclis12k,The prank was savage‚Ä¶ perfect timing because he‚Äôs so serious
2,Db-bclis12k,Teej just want you to know thanks for the video's man! They can really brighten up someone's day in just knowing there will be another day with teej !
2,Db-bclis12k,This one had me laughing so hard throughout the whole thing üòÇüòÇ great vid brother!!
2,Db-bclis12k,This was the best vlog of vlogmas so far üòÇ üôåüèæ would love to see more stuff like this
2,Db-bclis12k,"I‚Äôm pumped for the Harley content and potential collab! (Harley x Hunt?) Motovlogs with the boys? This brought me back to my motorcycle license test, the pressure was real"
2,Db-bclis12k,Let‚Äôs gooooo. Keep the Harley content coming! I did those kind of tests not the classroom but the riding stuff when I started to learn how to ride! Very good to know how to ride at low speeds which is the hardest to do.
2,Db-bclis12k,"Thats honestly weird af that they made you guys take the test so many times... I got my motorcycle license in August of 2019 and I did the class at Harley Davidson like TJ, and then I went into the DMV and they only made me take the motorcycle written test and then once I passed that they sent me to take my picture and called it a day... I did it in San Diego at the Chula Vista DMV 

Also where was the vision board update?

btw For The Boys... I went onto TheHuntandCompany website and saw some new Black Camo T-Shirts.. dont know if it was there before or if everyone else is just seeing them now too but just looking out incase you didnt know"
2,Db-bclis12k,"such a great vid, i was rolling the whole time. rare successful sabrina prank on tj!!"
2,Db-bclis12k,I wish I have friends like yours TJ they‚Äôre the best üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,Love how their merch says ‚Äúkeep moving forward‚Äù when that‚Äôs literally the one thing they‚Äôre struggling to do
2,Db-bclis12k,"Good to goüéâ
Looking forward to some Harley content, 
Live to ride‚ù§"
2,Db-bclis12k,Who else thinks that was the best vlogmas episode yet?! Bloopers at the end were icing on the cake üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,I can‚Äôt wait for Kev and Calvin to get bikes if they haven‚Äôt already. These motorcycle vlogs are going to be insane. Maybe you can do some vlogs with the boys from thrashin supply
2,Db-bclis12k,Congrats boys! You earned it!
2,Db-bclis12k,Asked for the bloopers yesterday and received them today! Good on ya teej
2,Db-bclis12k,Congrats boys! And that glasses prank was pretty good lol.
2,Db-bclis12k,In my 2/3 years watching this channel is THE BEST video I've watched on this channel. Good on you guys.
2,Db-bclis12k,So pumped for more motorcycle content! Keep up the awesome videos!
2,Db-bclis12k,I took that same exact test at Harley in Sacramento two months ago! It was great and I‚Äôve enjoyed being a licensed hog rider these past few months
2,Db-bclis12k,Thank god I always felt like I was one of the only ones that didn‚Äôt own boots üòÇ. Glad to see I am not alone ü§ò
2,Db-bclis12k,I love tj‚Äôs vids but this one for sure is top tear good work boyzü§£
2,Db-bclis12k,That was honestly one of the funniest vlogs in awhile and entertaining
2,Db-bclis12k,"Congratulations on passing your hogg test ,just, and everyone else aswell well done üëè"
2,Db-bclis12k,Such a good vlog. Respect to Harley Davidson for reaching out and not playing the corporate big business card.
2,Db-bclis12k,The energy they Jokesüëç‚ú®Ô∏èbless all of you team supreme‚ú®Ô∏èü´°üëçüôè
2,Db-bclis12k,I think this was one of my favourite videos to date. I like the switch up in content
2,Db-bclis12k,"Tj has been a licensed hog rider for years, glad he finally learned how to ride a motorcycle Lmao"
2,Db-bclis12k,i am deadddddd tjs reaction to no glasses got me dying that fist on the mouth said it all üòÇüòÇ bruhhh this was a great video and yes im saying it with the hogs voice
2,Db-bclis12k,This is why vlogmas is great you get the intimate bonding you guys go through. Just funny randomness!
2,Db-bclis12k,"this vlogmas episode: truly 10/10, one of my favorite vids!"
2,Db-bclis12k,Another petition for Dillon to take over the vlog for 1 day of Vlogmas
2,Db-bclis12k,Haha absolutely love the video when tj comes out the stall he looked like a gta v character üòÇ that made my day it was so funny
2,Db-bclis12k,Lots of genuine smiles on both sides of the screen !!
2,Db-bclis12k,HD really sent a cease and desist just to get in a vlog and clout chase  üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,Sees like harley davidson took care of this the gentleman way. Things can be resolved without threatening to sue right away
2,Db-bclis12k,THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE EVER.....I Never laughed so much in one episode ü§£üòÇü§£!!!!!!
2,Db-bclis12k,One of the funniest videos I have seen from you tj!!! Keep it up! üòÇüëåüíØ
2,Db-bclis12k,WILD HOG! dude I‚Äôm so glad your a HD boy ! Growing up my entire family rode HD I have photo of myself sitting on my father and grand father lap riding and I got my first harley at 17 and got my street glide it‚Äôs awesome man something I hold near to my heart. Need a blockhead video bud
2,Db-bclis12k,this video was absolute gold üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,"It‚Äôs crazy to me because In Texas, all we have to do is take an MSC ( Motorcycle Safety Course) take our paper from them if we pass to a DMV, and they just put a class M initial on it boom you‚Äôre certified üòÇ"
2,Db-bclis12k,Tj and the boys are certified hog riders now ü§£
2,Db-bclis12k,On god tho I did this safety course in Florida and hands down the best riding course I‚Äôve ever done. I suggest to anyone wanting to ride to take one of these even if your state doesn‚Äôt require it
2,Db-bclis12k,This made me wanna get a motorcycle license lol
2,Db-bclis12k,It would have been such great promotion for Harley Davidson if you did that drop. So many people would be waring shirts with their logo on it. Probably close to a record number. Too bad for them...
2,Db-bclis12k,"Love HD being like you cant do that, but you can do this! Ferrari need to take note on how to be a cool company"
2,Db-bclis12k,Wow Harley Davidson is smart they realize that they can get more sales with the amount of presence teej has on YouTube . Good move Harley instead of sending a cease and desceac you used your mind and worki something out.
2,Db-bclis12k,*The intro should definitely win a YouTube award* üëè
2,Db-bclis12k,This might be my favorite Tj vid so far üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,I just knew Calvin would lay it down. üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,Kudos to Harley to pivoting and then doing a collab with these guys.
2,Db-bclis12k,That was the hardest fit I've ever seen in my life ü´°
2,Db-bclis12k,"I've watched your videos for years TJ, invested in Throtl  due to your videos, but I  never felt more disrespected then this video. I live that MC life, this video felt like an insult to my culture. Do better bro i know you can."
2,Db-bclis12k,Such a hilarious video that had me laughing. Good video
2,Db-bclis12k,Wait so there is a test to get an official license but no one bats an eye if you drive without one ? (Assuming TJ didnt until now)
2,Db-bclis12k,I think I had 6 points deducted for slow in the turn and not looking far enough lol
2,Db-bclis12k,Couldn't imagine why Harley didn't like your shirt.üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,"Good job guys, but harley Davidson has to do something with the rumors going around to save them"
2,Db-bclis12k,Wait until tj gets to dmv and finds out he has to take the class C test in order to pass for his m1 test as well
2,Db-bclis12k,"Kevin said it himself, Teej is deep voice Teej when he has the vest on ü§£"
2,Db-bclis12k,Nice part about my state is if you pass the motorcycle safety course you go right to the MVA and they just take your pic and hand you a license.  No more testing.
2,Db-bclis12k,"That was exactly the intro I wanted to see when I saw the thumbnail. Great video and I'm not at all into hogs ""BROTHER"" lol"
2,Db-bclis12k,This was an excellent video. A lot of good laughs
2,Db-bclis12k,Oohhhh a ride with the boys all linked to a sena would be amazing. I‚Äôd watch however many you posted lmao
2,Db-bclis12k,great vlog man it was fun to come along with the boys on this adventure
2,Db-bclis12k,Tj sounds like he‚Äôs gonna snap into a Harley Davidson.
2,Db-bclis12k,"Pretty obvious you'd get a C+D from harley, quite funny that this happened from it all üòÇ üòÇ"
2,Db-bclis12k,HAHAHA THAT GUN SHOT ON THE GIRL KILLED ME. I CHOKED ON MY FOOD
2,Db-bclis12k,Haha the intro teegüòÇ awesome videoüî•üî•
2,Db-bclis12k,Love the ends of the videos. Always the funniest missed clips üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,Laughing the whole timeüòÇüí™
2,Db-bclis12k,Really solid episode ngl super entertaining
2,Db-bclis12k,"I can fully see Calvin turning up to your house on a R1, decked out in a black suit and helmet."
2,Db-bclis12k,There had BETTER BE some  Harley videos coming!
2,Db-bclis12k,Definitely want one of those shirts once they let you go through with it
2,Db-bclis12k,Props to sabrina on the glasses prank üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,"Wow, imagine almost failing üò≥"
2,Db-bclis12k,That intro was hilarious ü§£
2,Db-bclis12k,Good news is taking this test through Harley Davidson gets you a deduction from insurance.. I mean I scored 100% having never ridden on the street at that point but  I mean every one i different yea? lol
2,Db-bclis12k,Tbh I thought of TJ as more of a sports bike kinda guy
2,Db-bclis12k,i really enjoyed watching the riding portion. ive been riding streetbikes for almost 32 years now. current HOG is a 2019 Kawasaki ZX14R (my profile pic) with a LUIGI helmet cover.
2,Db-bclis12k,"Honestly, Harley is awesome for this. 
""Ya.. no you can't do that.. but if you want too, let's talk üòâ"" 
That's how you do business."
2,Db-bclis12k,TJ Hunt Awesome Video I think it's awesome that you guys got your Motorcycle Drivers Licenses and I can't wait to see what you and Harley Davidson have in the works and I also think it's awesome that you guys went to the Harley Davidson Academy
2,Db-bclis12k,‚Äú you hit a con ‚Äú ‚Äú I do that ‚Äú üòÇ
2,Db-bclis12k,As soon as I saw the design first shown I said yup there‚Äôs gona be legal issues there!
2,Db-bclis12k,"The receptionist doing her darndest NOT TO BREAK OUT INTO HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER ü§£ü§£ü§£

2,Db-bclis12k,Love this bike content man great video
2,Db-bclis12k,10/10 for that intro. Need some Hunt & Co Biker jackets
2,Db-bclis12k,I can‚Äôt imagine teej throwing down lol.
2,Db-bclis12k,Teej you should also checkout some of those sweet Japanese super sports ;) they're cheap too
2,Db-bclis12k,7:43 this is where TJ channels his inner Toretto
2,Db-bclis12k,What a good example. Everyone would be better off to take some friends and do a riding course. Most even provide bikes to practice and test on.
2,Db-bclis12k,Let‚Äôs go I just make dinner and gonna see this video üí™üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èmuch love Teej
2,Db-bclis12k,Taking the MSF Course this weekend... pretty nervous!
2,Db-bclis12k,that intro killed me ü§£ü§£ü§£
2,Db-bclis12k,That class is super easy passed mine with a perfect score
2,Db-bclis12k,That intro was spot on. For the Boyzzzzz!!!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Previous gen s63 and s65 amg are a masterpiece, best work from Mercedes thus far. It can never be topped"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Looks absolutely KILLER. There‚Äôs really not much negative to say about it but I do have a few things that come to mind because who wants an overly positive yes-man? Lol. First things first the design language of amg has become so cohesive that I will say all the cars do look extremely similar. Wouldn‚Äôt mind more distinction between them. Although the panamericana grill looks great here I am getting bored of it. Especially with all the aftermarket conversions people are doing. The s63 has always had a unique grill and this could‚Äôve been an opportunity to introduce us to something fresh. Was also expecting a fresh new steering wheel design as well. Over all I‚Äôm excited for this and glad that it exists.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Looking at the other comments I probably get hate for it, but ignoring the optional radar I actually like the look. Not creative, but imo good looking."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"A Stormtrooper spec, White with carbo fiber bits would look mental on this!!!"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Looks gorgeous and thank goodness they‚Äôve kept the V8 üëçüî•
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"long time coming, im happy that they didn't misplace the fuel cap for electric charging and tail lights are great."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"That sensor in the front grill is ridiculous though, couldn't they have put it anywhere else?"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Would love to see this powertrain in the 2024 E Class!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Detailed and informative as ever, keep up the good work üëç"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Lovely growl from that V8, almost seems to sound a bit better than GT63S E-Performance üî•"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"great video raz keep it up!  Question: why does the amg S63 have only 2.5 degrees rear wheel steering while the new S-class has 10 degrees?
I noticed the same difference in the GT63s- does it hinder performance?"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"I don't like those wheels and am still... on the fence about the Panamericana grille. Don't think it suits the nature of the S-Class compared to, say, the GT63. But the overall package looks immense and, I'm sure, will perform magnificently."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"The AMG looks are wayyy to overstated for an S-class. The Pan-Americana Grill destroys the classiness and elegance, the predecessor AMG  had a better mix between sportiness and elegance."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"7:53 electromagnetic engine mounts are present in 2018 S63 as well üòâ
16:00 showing off üòÆ‚Äçüí®
21:30 stock S63 2023 sounds much better than stock 2018 S63 ü§©

You could added top speed 250kmh or 290kmh with driver pack, as the 2018 was 250kmh/315kmh üòÇ
The space for luggage is 300l, the predecessors was 550l üòÜ"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Any word if they‚Äôll make an S65 variant with a V12? This gen Maybach has it
2,_DRK0qjoLac,When you changed it to w222 it's showed how beautiful and exquisite the w222 design compared to this one
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"12:30 - I immediately hate the implementation of that sensor. I really hope that this is merely the prototype and that the production units will have the sensors tucked away nicely inside the badge as usual, even for the level 3. Quick question... Do the tail lights really dance like that when you start up the V8, or was it the camera misbehaving as it always does when recording LED's? If it's not an actual feature, please ask them to add it. It looks amazing."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,charging this on a public charger will be such a flex xD
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"What‚Äôs a sound.
I love it"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Sooo... they replace the hood ornament, a Mercedes-Benz insignia for over half a century, with the big star in the grill in order to hide cameras and sensors. Then they add more cameras and sensors that don't fit under there, scattering it all over, making it look like a hot mess. Worst of both worlds, gg Mercedes"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,This is definitely the best modern s class. Wow. Love it
2,_DRK0qjoLac,well this will even more plumet in price with this battery stuff then the old ones. its just a big red flag to buy a used one.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,I have a 2022 S580 and I gotta say I like the grille on my car more than the Panamericana on the S class.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,16:45 it literally looks like you are sitting in heaven
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Hybrids are the future, not EV's"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Great video. I hope one day I can get there too doing live reviews on new models rather than having to use videos from the manufacturers üòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôve compared this to the previous W222 though. Let me know what you think of it!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,The new s63 now comes with a.3.5 liter 4 cylinder with e performance üòÅ
2,_DRK0qjoLac,The s class MUST have the star on the bonnet
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Should I trade my c63s for this !? üò≠ I can‚Äôt
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Still has the v8 üòçüòç I think it's the next one!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Just looks like a bigger version of the C63......Mercedes are miles behind BMW in the design stakes.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,amazingly carüî•üî•
2,_DRK0qjoLac,that thing sounds like a dragon on start up!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Who thought when he showed the old S Class wow that looks better than this. New nose looks the same as every AMG from A45 up. If I‚Äôm spending that sort of money I want differentiation.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Incredible. I think it's their best s class, ever"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,My dream üòç
2,_DRK0qjoLac,2.6 tonnes!!. How can this be efficient. Its more powerful yes but constantly carrying 400kg extra weight for its entire existence is not progress. Ill buy the old S63...when it comes down to 50k
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"that sensor in the panamericana grill looks so cheap and ugly, but otherwise its a true beast"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Oh boy each time I come back with hopes to see a great Mercedes what I am facing is just another ""descending"" D pillar car... I can't do this anymore.. From now on I am going to skip all Mercedes videos until they fix their d pillar curve.. Dear Mercedes designers, I am begging you: Bring back the ""Ascending d pillar"" please!... I am tired of imagining a shitting dog each time I see a mercedes. Until you fix it Mercedes doesn't exist for me."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,What a story for a 6kw battery that is empty in one acceleration ü§£.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Thumbs up for the dragon ball z intro ! Love the instant transmission
2,_DRK0qjoLac,finally they fixed that stupid sticking camera on the nose as they have it on the regular S class. Love it now!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"SENSORS ON THE GRILL ARE A BIT WONKY. OTHERWISE, SHE'S A NICE PIECE OF KIT."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Not a fan of the Panamericana grill on the S.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Happy it came without the power domes on the bonnet. Looks cleaner and does not fit all cars.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,I wonder how this will differentiate from the new E63S in terms of looks.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Someone swap that engine to the new C63S-E
2,_DRK0qjoLac,What a beast!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Sad that going forward Merc fanboys will have to spend upwards of AUD$400k-$450k to get sound like that? üò¢
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Wow, what a weapon!! Finally what I‚Äôve been waiting for! Time for a new daily ü•≥ü•≥"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Car these days looks so big and long that even an adult look like a kid next to it üòÇ
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Do you know why on the bonnet we no more the silver arrow badge ? It‚Äôs an S-class
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Looks way better than that hideous 7-series
2,_DRK0qjoLac,So  what‚Äôs 800 brake HP to the rest of us?
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Looks nice but this grille makes it look like an E63 AMG. And what happened to the emblem on top of the hood? They never removed it from the previous S AMGs but now it doesn't differ from what Brabus has been doing.
They should've kept the horizontal grille (modifying it slightly in terms of thickness and color maybe) and kept the hood emblem so it stands out as an S-class and not an oversized E."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,0:58 Jesus! All that money and they couldn't creatively hide the Radar sensor somewhere else? üí¢üö™üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇüí®
2,_DRK0qjoLac,A big E class and an even bigger C class
2,_DRK0qjoLac,MB the bestÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Dear AMG
What happened to the sensor in the grille? You are coping the bad look of Audi? Oh dear, not good news. Where is this perfect Mercedes quality and engineering where they used to hide everything clean?"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,This is just a recycled GT63 SE in an S class body.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"The car is beautiful and thank you for this review but maybe you could have on clean sneakers next time.  They totally stood out in this video as the car is so clean and your shoes were not so clean.
Just a thought for your future videos."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Mercedes current design language is pretty good and infinitely better than what BMW is doing with some models. New 7 series anyone?
2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Looks way too much like the E63 S. However, this just tells me what the new E63 S E-Performance will have, 800+ HP E63 S."
2,_DRK0qjoLac,I love it üôåüôåüíØüíØ
2,_DRK0qjoLac,what a disappointment it looks like they stole a rendering design from a website and make it more uglier by sticking a radar in the middle of the grill !! i think this generation bmw is killing Mercedes in every category
2,_DRK0qjoLac,AMG is so delusional for keeping the V8 on this and giving the C63 a 2.0L! This company continues to disgust me because of their decision making.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Fantastic vehicle
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Will there be a S coupe still?
2,_DRK0qjoLac,did you hear any info about the coupe version?
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Bonkers car and video!
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Fantastic Video and first.. Love it will be ordering..
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Does not look classy as the previous s63 or s65! The Maybach is too much! The ageing S8 looks much better in comparision! Anyway these will go the US and China! And all these horsepowers!!! For what???
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Why do all new AMG's look the same? They all have the same tail lights and headlights.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Front sensor and camera look absolutly horrible. Like some glued on aftermarket part. Unacceptable.
2,_DRK0qjoLac,The interieur looks cheap as fuck with these big screens
2,_DRK0qjoLac,OH! MY! GOD!!! The taillights when you start with the #EmotionStart!!! That looked AWESOME!!!

2,_DRK0qjoLac,"Matte color and blacks wheels worst spec possible, not classy at all for such a car. Mercedes lost it since they cancelled the best models and engines in the line up. Hybrid is a joke with this range, don't care if it makes 800hp"
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Why did they move the radars :(
2,_DRK0qjoLac,Can I come check it out ?
2,_DRK0qjoLac,I don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm partial to BMW but even still‚Ä¶.. its not a good looking car

2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I've got an 06 Jimny Soft top, and its a brilliant little thing with the heart of a lion. At 06 I believe it to be one of the last soft tops available.
I had to have the death wobble sorted by our local Suzuki car dealer, and I put a new roof on it for about ¬£500. Easy job, even for a mechanical 1/2 wit like myself. It has had some welding done around a seatbelt mount.. I'm 6'2"" and 20 stone by the way, so I put it on rather than getting into it, but it is excellent."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"We had one of these in Skiathos last September. Brilliant off road, totally gutless on any slight incline. Distance between gears was about five minutes. The only advice we were given about the car was to make sure the roof wasn‚Äôt left open overnight - apparently cats like to use them as Airbnb‚Äôs (and toilets). We‚Äôll be getting another one next year üòÇüëç"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"My mother had a soft top Jimny until fairly recently. It suffered from the notorious Jimny ‚Äúdeath wobble‚Äù at around 45mph. Her partner did some research into it and discovered that the soft top versions, unlike the hard tops, were built in Spain, not Japan. They supposedly produced them with greater tolerances, hence the reason for the play in the steering."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Speaking of three spoke wheels. The only manufacturer that made the best-looking ones were Saab. Though, I vividly remember them on the original Range Rover (Classic); Vauxhall Nova and Corsa (in sportier guises); SMART Roadster, Ford Probe, and the Dodge Viper."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Definitely a market for it as an off road play thing. Decent set of tyres, and it‚Äôs good to go. The more adventurous may jack the suspension, add a snorkel and maybe even a roll cage and it‚Äôll be good to go"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"To be fair, 17 years old is getting on a bit as far as rust is concerned, for example plenty of Mercs and Beemers of that vintage have rusty bodies.  As for the emissions, a good code reader may well divulge a commonality between the various high readings.  However there is little scope for profit if sold as a runner, as matt often demonstrates solid flip cars are somewhat of a rarity.  It's why they get traded in, the owners already decided that fixing them up just isn't viable, either through a multitude of faults or a single major problem."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Definitely something to be said for the greenlaning pitch. They get mutated to all sorts of degrees, external roll cages, massive wheels and snorkels. There's even one I know of that's had a Cavalier 1.7TD engine fitted üï∫"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Love your videos as always! Would you recommend buying a Jimny and carrying out rust prevention? Also what do you use to film in the cabin? Great quality and angle üëåüèº
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"We've had a couple of Jimnys, our current one is the same age and about the same age, rust has never been a problem for us though the engine warning light is, every year or two it decides to come on for no obvious reason. Their flat paint doesn't age well either.

Suzukis are generally reliable especially with  age, that's why they're beloved in developing countries."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,I‚Äôm very glad you‚Äôve acknowledged Japanese rust (and interior quality) because so many people focus on the mechanical reliability of Jap stuff but don‚Äôt realise how shyte the original construction was. Note to Japan: the UK can‚Äôt accept your motors because we Salt our roads and we can‚Äôt be arsed to go about cleaning and protecting your chassis.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I had an especially good chuckle at this video! Great stuff. The Japanese Car lovers will be a bit butthurt over this one. In fairness, even though I don't drive one currently, I do love a good Toyota."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Rented one exactly like that on holiday in Corfu and loved it. They probably rust a bit less in Corfu I'm guessing üòÅ
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Very very good timing. I was toying with a Jimny for Dartmoor lanes and that has put me right off the ones at sensible prices. As my local bodyshop on Dartmoor, a mere 500 yards away, never ever gets back to me with a quote for work, I can't face having to sort out welding etc. Saved me a fortune,, thank you!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I recently decided I needed another wallet draining hobby so I got a 2005 grand vitara with all the off-road bits, what a load of fun that‚Äôs been for a cheap laugh 

Love watching the jimny and vitara off road"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"My mom had one of the hardtop versions of those many years back. I heard a report that they rolled easily.  My old man insisted on proving me wrong, then very nearly rolled it in his exhuberance to do so. Hilarious.  Hideous old bucket even if it didn't roll."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Wife had one early 2000‚Äôs. Great car for the shops as she used to pull up Velcro on roof and put bags in the back.  Drive that at 70mph on M25 and you‚Äôll realise what scared feels like.  Steering was shocking!
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I gave this video a 'like' at the intro, because I knew it was going to be a good one. Keep those cheap car videos coming, they're great fun."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Love the videos mate, please keep up the cheap car buys - they‚Äôre the best part of the channel üëçüèº"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Good video! I‚Äôm actually working through my rusty Jimny at the moment and it‚Äôs cost me ¬£1000 to weld, MOT, battery, bulbs and brake hoses. I‚Äôm hoping to get a decent return on it, but there‚Äôs nothing left for it to rot, it‚Äôs mostly weld and sheet metal!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Its good to see that you are now testing cars that fit better with your character.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a pity that I bought what I thought was quite a rare Suzuki Jimny because it had no roof, it turns out it‚Äôs got no chassis either‚Äù üòÇ"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Great but sad video Matt,  both for you and the car.  You tried your best and offered it a chance.  Sorry to hear that it didn't work out.  Good lesson for us Japanophiles who believe that the answer to everything is non European- carwise.  Thanks."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I had a Jimny as a loan car.  (I'd previously been given a Suzuki Liana ...üò≥) 
Loved it's Tonka truck looks - hated the roadholding.
Incidentally for years I thought the model name was 
'Jimmy ' (as in Osmond - oh that ages me !)"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Farmers love them as an alternative to the John Deere Gators and their ilk.
Loads have been converted to flat beds - basics implements added....etc...üëçüëç"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Due to the cost of living crisis it still might a cheaper option than a traditional Turkey this year‚Ä¶.. üòÇüòÇ Love the reviews Matt üëç
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I have been into cars all my life, I'm currently 26 years old, and I literally JUST found out it's Suzuki JimNy and not Jimmy ü§£"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Looking at the old Jimny you can certainly tell the Suzuki design team has modernised drastically! Great video mate, can wait for the next! üòÉ"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Ironically, the new Jimny was removed from sale on the UK market because of exhaust emissions. It seemingly wouldn't have complied with Euro 7, due in 2025.....  I think someone wiped their rectum on that MOT certificate Matt.  I liked the ""find somebody who is handy with a MIG welder"" bit - and a bible presumably......"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Yes. High Peak back to form with a car that needs more work than the titanic. Feels like being reunited with an old friend
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"This video again reminds me what a bargain the Terios is. Twice the doors, much more comfortable and modern inside, and half the money for an equivalent mileage and spec!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"‚ÄúThought it was a creature, no just a bit of rust"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Neighbour has one in full black with snorkel, it's awesome. Definitely like to see this in the hands of someone who'll get some more like out of it."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I think this is the first car on the channel you've bought that doesn't ""just needs a good buff"" to fix  ü•∫"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Let us know what eventually happened to it...would be a great farm car
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Love the Jimny I bought new one in 2017, should kept it but it's worth more now than I paid for it, madness."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Very entertains. My wife had one of these a few years prior to our meeting - loved it! Going even further back to 1979, a pal of mine turned.up at a party with the predecessor, which had a 648cc two stroke engine,  I had a series III Land Rover at the time & we did a bit of green landing. I must admit, that althe thing sounded like a strummer, it wasn‚Äôt too bad off road. That was until he tried to follow me down a steep bit to a oriver crossing, for some reason he managed to w turn it on its side. No problem we just pulled it upright & off it went again. He also decided to hook up a trailer loaded with about a ton of sand & gravel in it - very embarrassing, he couldn‚Äôt use the high range, and a right hand turn at some traffic lights, saw us only about halfway across the intersection in fourth. Gear when the lights changed - they changed again before the trailer was half way across..üòä"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Rented  a Jimny whilst on holiday on a greek island many years back and it was great fun for the sort of roads out there - wouldn't want one to drive in the UK though. Bit of a shame that it was so rotten as it might have lived on for a while - hope it brings you some profit as well as the entertainment it provided for usüòä
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Well Matt, this was good entertainment value that I would give a 7 !!! Keep the super work up üëçüèº"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I suppose, where they don‚Äôt salt their own roads, the Japanese make something that would last forever, in their own country. Astonishingly, and this is true car nerd, geek heaven, those trace their roots back, to 1970 üò≥"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I have had 3 Suzuki's, my current a 2022 Ignis all of which came or come with a 12 year rust guarantee.I have had no repairs made on any of the 3 cars,and that includes the fact that in winter here in Denmark a large amount of salt is used on the roads."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,I actually came across this on eBay and thought I recognised the place it was taken looked at the seller and my mind clicked on someone will probably buy it for a offroader
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,I seriously recognise and respect your positivity Matt facing utter piles of shit at times.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Good evening mat,I had one these years ago, in red it was great fun, I sold it for ¬£2000 to a green laner who probably completely destroyed it..cheers Phil form Newark"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Wonder how many viewers will get that ""Little Boy"" reference?
I'm sure all the other Japanese brands are very grateful to Toyota, and Honda for creating this notion among the Public that all Japanese brands are excellent quality. As far as the Jimny goes, bit ironic that vehicles that shape and size are now wildly popular in America. Thing is, the Public here wants such vehicles to be car-based. Why have something like the Jimny that's actually capable of going off-road, when you can have something that simply looks as if it can."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,‚ÄúI‚Äôve owned several over the years‚Äù.....matt is there a car youve only ever owned once?!
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"My family used to go on holiday in Cyprus occasionally, and we always got a convertible Suzuki jeep as a hire car."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I‚Äôm on my second one, I absolutely love it. My second one is auto JLX with 30,000 on a 56 plate"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Pair of second bumpers, pair of pattern sills and an aftermarket radio and that‚Äôd be good to go and probably ¬£2500+ in winter / spring"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"That is soo right and what I say all the time, no point praising the mechanics of these sort of cars but the rot takes hold easily, I used to have many Japanese cars but never again, they just rot soo badly and it‚Äôs not worth it at all. You will always be chasing rust on most past 10 years old. Hondas are particularly bad (especially the UK built ones) and they need to stay in Japan really with their salt free roads. They just can‚Äôt make do with the UK climate really. Great video though as always."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Bit of wheel spin for the lads  ! made me laugh ü§£
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"My lady has a 2002 Jimny. Great little car! Sure they rust, but when your sills are only about 3 feet long they're not going to be the biggest expense to repair. Hasn't failed an MOT yet. Just the odd couple of advisories each year, which we duly get put right. Far less issues than my 2006 Jag S Type R, I can tell you that much! We took a 2,000 mile road trip to Ireland in September and the little 1.3 petrol didn't miss a beat. Even got some pretty mucky green laning into the mix, on road tires. If you accept you may have to spend a few hundred ¬£'s a year to keep one fully roadworthy then they'll just keep on going. If however, you decide to neglect those little rust repair jobs then it will of course come back to haunt you. But that's the same with almost any older vehicle. I've spent thousands on my Jag in the last 5 years. Far more than I paid for the car itself, and I get way less reliability and usability than we get from our little Jimny workhorse. The Jag goes fast (if it goes), the Jimny goes any and everywhere, every time!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,First time I came across a Jimny it was Wheeler Dealers and they bought one thinking it could be fixed - it couldn't.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Haha that was entertaining! Good to see a different side to you enjoying the simpler things too
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Get the emissions tested at your local VW dealer, I‚Äôm sure it will pass"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Think I‚Äôm right in saying All the convertibles were made in Spain because originally they were intended for the Spanish holiday car rental companies
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"great video, i always enjoy watching your videos.  keep it up üí™"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Great review of this jeep definitely never knew about this car
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,It needs a good Italian Tune Up. I doubt it's been driven hard through the gears for some time.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Great video matt but right to sell as spares or repair or take the wheels off and keep chickens in it üòÜ good luck matt hope you shift it üëç
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt give Japanese slack for rust. As all cars rust in some way. It also depends where you live. If you live in Canada, those most likely rot to hell due to the snow and coldness. Where‚Äôs with like say some place always warm, might not. Even then, I‚Äôve seen pictures of French, German, british having rust issues. These were old and modern examples."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Not all all Japanese cars are rot boxes‚Ä¶..we have an 02 3 door rav4 in black‚Ä¶.used every day for last 7 years‚Ä¶.approx 110k‚Ä¶.passed every mot, probably a future classic."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I think a lot of the Japan vs Europe reliability points come from the Japanese market.  There they treat cars (and even homes for that matter) more like appliances.  The equivalent of the MOT is far stricter, so many cars are sent abroad after only a handful of years.  So cars that don't make it to 5-10 years without a major mechanical problem would be a big issue for the manufactures, but one that rots away in 20 when it's sitting in a different country not so much.  Can't help but feel that will apply at least a bit to global operations as well.  And as all cars need to be cost-cut to some extent can you blame them for prioritising the poor sod who paid full whack to your own coffers over a theoretical owner 15 years from now?"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Not always the case, but far too expensive s/h for what they are now.  Having said that I wouldn't mind one at the right price üòÄ For a petrol very capable off road."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"You chose the model to avoid like the plague. The spanish built soft-tops with zero corrosion protection, poor paint application and a soft-top that funnels water into its important places tells you why there are so few of these left. Emmissions are probably a failing sensor. 3 spoke wheels are a nightmare to get to balance."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"You seem to know a lot about Malibu Barbie, Matt! Is there something you're not telling us? Hehe. It is a shame bout the Jimny. Every one I've ever driven has had something really wrong with it, or at least something that's made it uncomfortable to drive. I hope you get something back from it anyway. Cheers."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"To be fair many so called luxury cars from this period rusted and proved to suffer from poor reliability including Mercedes Benz (front wings, sills rear subframes, wheel arches), Audi (sills), Range Rovers (numerous places.) Other cars that rusted from this period include Volkswagen Polo ( Sills and front wings), Volkswagen Golf (front/ rear wings and sills), Audi (sills), Citroen Berlingo (rear subframe, sills), Ford KA (everywhere!) and Ford Focus (sills.)"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"It‚Äôs probably end up as a off Road warrior. And probably in about 10 years time, people would give you an arm and a leg for it. Maybe worth sticking it a shed for a few years, then pull it out and do a full decent re-store on it."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,I lived in Trinidad for a few years and these were quite popular. Slow and noisy is how I remember them but excellent little offroaders.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Love a suzuki... my brother's first car was a K reg vitara convertible with fat boy wheels and a roof that needed someone to hold it down at 50mph.. it was a complete laugh to drive.. the fuel indicator needle was broken so we'd guess how much was left in the tank and even ran out once.. the starter motor was fried so it always felt like you'd won a tenner on the lottery if it started first time.. in the end we sold it for ¬£350 to a couple of Irish lads who had to push start it when they wanted to take it for a test drive.. good times.. lol
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Some of the non body and chassis issues may be down to lack of servicing. You always say most cars are much better if serviced and there wasn't any mention of it. Pity it was so bad.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Jimnys are ok but you still can‚Äôt beat a Range Rover in my book üòÇ
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I can beat that. About 30 years or so ago I bought a second hand Datsun Cherry, I didn't have a clue what I was doing and the bloke who sold it to me knew it. It cost a couple hundred quid which then was a lot. It was so rotten that it didn't even make it home before one whole side of it collapsed. I literally paid ¬£200 ish to deliver it to a scrap lorry who gave me I think ¬£30."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I went to buy a jimny once, I couldn‚Äôt fit in the driver seat üòÇ"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Good video Matt as always. üëç
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I was going to buy one as a weekend car,    a 1.3 and as dead as a door nail...a  horrible drive.... bought a 2.4 petrol 2014 Grand Vitara instead, it's brilliant."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Have a 'soft-spot' for Suzuki's Matt as I have a Grand Vitara (Never owned a Jimny though)....shame to see its suffering the tin worm and as you say jap cars do rust although my 14 year old Vitara has no mention of rust (Just m.o.t'd today).....I'm sure one of the off road boyz will snatch your arm off for that as a Sunday toy....Bouncy as hell, but will give  supposedly 'much more  capable' off roaders a run for the money!
Keep up the cheapie vids!...üëçüëç"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Absolutely one of my favorite small SUVs. Great around town. not so on a highway where you tend to
become a Born Again Christian praying it doesn't blow over evertime an HGV passes by...."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"You have forgotten the Saab 900 turbo had 3 spoke alloys which looked good, so maybe the only car which did"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I saw this on the High Peaks site earlier today (only because I had set the filter to petrol) . . .
Hopefully you'll find a buyer - it definitely wouldn't ring my bell :)"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Quick Q, best budget 4 wheel drive, Jimny or Panda?"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Just little fact, softops need cambelts, different engine in hardtops that are chain drive so will need belt as well sadly üò¢"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"A few years ago, I was looking at getting a tow vehicle. Found a Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel at a Car yard.Stunk of  üê¥  üí© all thru it and with hay all thru the interior. Obviously a horse family and would have been towing  a horse trailer. Easy, fast pass and couldn't believe the Car dealer rushed it thru, to put onto the lot. Brave buying a car, without a first inspection. üëç"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,One of my friends has one of these. Absolutely loves it. Spent a fortune keeping it going
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Can you transfer the engine and drivetrain onto a homemade chassis? Maybe add a cabin and rear cargo space?
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Don‚Äôt be hating on Japanese cars and Suzuki because of that rot box Matt. Here ( southern hemisphere ) we get made in Japan models cheaper than in England and they dont rot .Japanese reliability is a real thing. My swift sport is a great drive albeit without the finish so many people seem to want.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Oooh... that front bumper! Craftsmanship, at its best! ü§£"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Loving the temporary attack of yobbishness at the end üòÇ
I had a little 04 kia picanto (my first ‚Äòflip‚Äô) and it was so liberating driving that thing. Not worrying about damaging the clutch or anything‚Ä¶brilliant. Great video!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Of cause you would never find a rotten Range Rover or Land Rover of the similar age or newer that didn't need a mechanic rebuild as well. As we have seen on your channel.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Not all Japanese cars rust I‚Äôve a 02 plate Nissan Almera and a 03 plate Primera and ok there British built but not a spec of rust on them and underneath looks new the Primera for example still has the original exhaust system on it‚Ä¶ wonder if the rusty chassis thing is a Spain issue has the Nissan navara had a issue with this and was also built in Spain also the plusars have problems with rust underneath and that was a also made in Spain ‚Ä¶ü§î
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"There is a rule in Japan where you cant keep cars on the road that are older than a certain age, i think its 10 years or something. It probably explains why the chassis is not as tough as the rest of the car"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Matt, I always look forward to watching your videos. I appreciate the honesty in your reviews. I wish you would upload more in a week but that‚Äôs asking a lot from a man who works all day everyday. I hope this channel grows and gets the success and recognition it deserves. Thank you sir for your great work!"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"A rule I have stuck to that has never failed yet is, only buy Japanese cars made in actual Japan. 
The reason is simple and cultural. If a Japanese company builds something in Japan and it turns out to have defects when exported, that's really shameful for Japanese people. 
If it's made in a foreign factory and has defects well, there will be people in management who will say ""We told you so, foreigners do not understand our culture."" They will use it as proof of Japanese superiority.
(I had this explained to me by a prof. of engineering at Tokyo University that I got friendly with, so I believe it.)"
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"I'd love a Jimny as a daily, but they are too small for what I require. Its a shame."
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Here in NZ a lot of these become farm runabouts then spend their final days blocking a hole in a hedge.  Cow poo on an already rusted body means they develop big holes very quickly.

2,MsFL14Gy_0I,Matt do you not remember the Fiat 3 spoke claw alloys on the Stilo? The wheels looked better than the car itself.
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,If I was a car I'd be a Jimny !
2,MsFL14Gy_0I,"Me and my mate looked at this exact Jimmy on Auto trader last week and said f#ck no, it was up for ¬£1,500. I realised it was the same one from the stained MOT papers."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I was wondering when this was going to happen.  Great choice, the Tenere is known to be a real workhorse, super dependable and just what you need without going overboard.  Excellent choices on the aftermarket bits as well!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"@MotoFeelz, bike looks crazy good. I'm not normally a fan of adventure bikes but this one has a bit of a Mad Max vibe that I really like."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"In case it is of interest to you, the high exhaust that I have seen in another video is more protected from blows and prevents it from breaking.
The only drawback would be the right rear indicator, but with your change it doesn't affect you anyway.
I have seen it on the CDOM Motovlog website. here the details... It is an HPCorse here the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4XuQn9EK4


Can't wait until the 2nd part of it"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Rob! Congrats!!! Very exciting for you (and us viewers!) Really looking forward to all your new content with the bike (and hope we still see the street scrambler from time to time!). I'm running a T120 and Tiger and feel like a street bike plus adventure bike is the way to go! Always love your content and seeing one of your new videos pop up puts a smile on my face!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Phase 1 build is already beautiful, can't wait for the full docked out bike üî•üî•"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Congrats man, this would be my next bike after my modern classic for sure, have you seen the Crispy Club kit, gives it a nice retro styling - looking forward to seeing this bike in the future camping videos!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Oh damn! This going to be an awesome bike. That adjustment thing for the screen, was made by a genius. üëçüèª"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Great looks ! üëç And the sound of the exhaust seems cool too ü§´
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Such a great motor, that Yamaha CP2! Already looking fantastic with your mods. Now take the scrambler back to minimalist, bare bones, bad assedness."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"grats on the no bike! got one myself in may, loving your take on the build.  hightly recommend the Camel kickstand, waaaayyyy more confident on pivots etc."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Great looking bike.  I can't wait to see phase 2.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Every single time I got on my T7, all I could do was grin and be thankful.  It's such a great bike.  Awesome video."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,congrats on your ongoing build :D do you ever ride with a passenger? how do you work that out?
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Looks good man. Did you buy it used?

I am still torn between buying an adventure vs sport touring bike... Until I make my mind up I guess my CB will have to live through the beating."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,So keen to see the transformation continue!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,I hope you'll be satisfied using it  with what you ever want to doüßøüëçüèª
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Beautiful walk-around cinematography and background music. Loved it. üëç And of course the bike looks amazing.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Belle pr√©parations petit fr√®re j'avais exactement la m√™me que j'ai gard√© 2 ans mais franchement ma 650 royal enfield interceptor pr√©parations baak me donne encore plus de satisfaction ü•∞ et cerise sur le g√¢teau elle passe aussi de partout üòÅ
Tu vois partout o√π tu ais je te vois üòä
Chang√© rien mon gars tu ais au top !!! üòâ"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Damn,  I was looking at getting a scrambler...now I'm reconsidering. Sick bike!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Rode one a little while ago mate t7 is sick what got me was the stability great power very impressed you‚Äôll luv it just turn that abs off ruins everything happy riding man cheers
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Great bike. I have the exact same bike with many mods also. I completely dig mine. Hope your digging your as well. Another great video as well.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Gotta be honest I really hate seeing Ridge ads due to their offensively absurd pricing.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"While the sound of the Akrapovic is great, you might run into problems when you drop the bike on its right side and damaging more than just the exhaust. This is a known problem with the T7 and is fixed by changing the exhaust to one running up high."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Congrats for your new bike! I'm really excited when you revealed your new bike is tenere because is gonna fit with your camping videos
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I bought mine 1 1/2 years ago and love mine. Enjoy! 4 months of winter to go here in Canada, can`t wait to get back on the T7."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Damn man you are living my dream. I have a 2020 mt10 and love it but I have been
Wanting the T7 for a while now. I live on the central coast and have been watching your vids for inspiration for moto camping.  Love your content keep up the good work."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,You can check out the Huzar high exhaust for the T7 as well. They're cheap and fairly well received in the T7 forums. I have them as well on my T7 and they're pretty great.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,I looked up ‚Äúthe rubber things‚Äù you used on your exhaust. There were reviews on Amazon (U.S.) that stated they melted. One had pics. Just a heads up. I still bought a set. Lol. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"That's bad ass broo! Cant wait for you to make that adjustment on the pipe exhaust, making it higher and look better. Ride safe!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I dig your colour scheme and your house layout man! Damnnnn, dream buildsüòÆ‚Äçüí®ü´∂"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"dude!!!  after seeing it last night on the other video, and now seeing the build, I want one!   I'm currently rocking a Yamaha FJR1300 (which kicks ass for touring, but its a heavy 300kg beast of a bike)....might need to see how I can score myself a T7"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"well worth watching to the very end to hear that awesome tone!! Great video, glad you got a new bike too."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,This is my dream bike.. You made a great decision buying the T7!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Just bought the T7 yesterday and put 300 miles on her. Now she‚Äôs  sleeping next to my MT10! 
Thanks for the video, the SRC products look like the way to go! Keep the good videos going."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Offroad is where it starts to shine!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Looks excellent. You're making me want a new bike.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Looks awesome! Exciting project.
All but the cheap levers, never buy cheap levers could be your life man"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Hell yeah I‚Äôm excited for this build ü§©
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Here in the Northeast U.S. the Tenere 700s haven't been available at all since being introduced. I have never seen one on a showroom floor.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,it suits your life style sir hope you enjoy to the fullest!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I have an idea, it would look fantastic the instrument panel mounted on the side of the motor!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Great bike, Great vid as always. Love it!!!! :)"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Mate that looks the ducks nutz!!! She looks so tall too!! I got in touch with SRC and name dropped, I reckon I'll get a headlight protector for the Africa Twin for sure!

Can't wait to see you get out tehre on this beast!! Looks wicked!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,i had a 750 in the early ninties  .not many sold in australia but the super ten 750 were popular in europe   nice holden wagon
2,jVH9tKeKE38,yeah i bought one 10 weeks ago for my iceland road trip; PERFECT BIKE
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Finally pulled my finger out and watched this video. Cheers for the mention too, bike is looking good üëåüèºüëåüèº"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"For the exsaust there's one made in Italy from ""sc project"" that stay much higher. Here's a video where they mount it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Mrh9J3jUI&ab_channel=DANNYLAZZARIN"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Rob you need to upgrade front and rear shocks and put a steering damper  on  it will help you off road and put busters on your handlebars put protaper bars just help the bike a little bit better off road
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"One of my favorite bike t7,, so congratulations Again,, ü§üü§üü§ü"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Yeah boy soo cool looking foward to the up n coming footage üëå
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Love mine. You need some new rubber on there.

It‚Äôs in the plan, I should have watched your whole video first üòÇ"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Looks amazing
2,jVH9tKeKE38,You had me right up until the shorty levers üòÖ
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Damn! can't wait! I put a deposit on a black T7 on Oct 19 and still have no idea when it'll come in!!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,For sure is a more versatile bike. Congratulations!! ü§òüèºü§†üíÄ
2,jVH9tKeKE38,I am so here for this build. üëçüèæ
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Love your othe channel and follow it from the humble beginning...a warm hug from a fan from Tel Aviv
2,jVH9tKeKE38,looks so cool waiting for next video for new accessories fitting
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Can't wait to see her modded up bro.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,I think it's awesome the way you are fixing your bike up bad ass man. Can't wait until the 2nd part of it
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Ride T7 in good health!!! Enjoy your trips!!! I hope you won‚Äôt sell Triumph, ‚Äòcause I love it! Tasos from Greece"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Looks mean! Love it.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Congratulations from Thailand.
You will enjoy your Tenere' more and more every ride.
Take a look on my little channel."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I really want to take the piss out of you for replacing the Triumph, but I like the look of the Yamaha and what you are doing to it."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Happy for you brother. I figured you for a triumph tiger 900 rally pro guy. But the T7 is such a bloody beast hey. Beautiful brother. Happy miles
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Congrats , i have been eyeing up one for years now, one day."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Looks awesome
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Awesome upgrade.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Master Rob you are happy we all are happy for you enjoy
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Looks a perfect bike for your adventures in camping
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Great choices Rob..bike is looking fab!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Congratulations and welcome to the club!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"It has not been very clear to me if you continue to maintain the scrambler or if you have changed it for the Tenere 700. In any case, the motorcycle choice seems very successful for what you do, although I feel sorry for you to have been undone of the Scrambler, It seems to me a very exclusive and a lot of personality."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"just an idea, could you cover up or change the lime / yellow text to the same as the forks? I first thaught, it looked like it on instagram but would probably look really nice"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,It's too bad SRC continues to just copy other companies designs. You're gonna love the T7.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,bro the bike looks rediculous sick!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Yeah, kinda looks like Year Zero final act Batman's bike. Cool ride."
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Link for the windscreen adjusters please Rob ‚Ä¶ ‚úåÔ∏èü¶ébike looks awesome so far ‚Ä¶.
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"you're at the right way now!! im waiting to sell first my tenere xt660z and then go for t7 too..
But not before March of 23' cause then Yamaha release the t7 at tech kamo color..
this color have it already tracers 700 & 900 ...
cheers!!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,The T7 is a great bike for sure but after watching Ryan F9 on the desert X you could have regret that you didn‚Äôt remortgage the house and sell your soul for that Italian goodness. A shame the T7 doesn‚Äôt have cruise control. Best upgrade to your bike is better rubber!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,only TRIUMPH suits you NOT yamaha or other brands  ! Congratulations !
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Right choice to adventure! Cheers
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Yess mate, very capable bike now, supporting here in the Philippines. Saw you using the DJI action 3 on the other channel, are you going to review that on this channel?"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Congratulations!!!!!!!! Enjoy your purchase!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,SC Project also make a high exhaust for the tenere
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Finally! Congrats!
2,jVH9tKeKE38,How many extra kg did all the bolt-ons add?
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Congrats!!! üëå
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Had same slip on for r3 but üò¢ why yours sounds better ? üò≠
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Really cool video, thanks for sharing"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"I own 2 CP2 engined bikes,I have no intention of buying a Tenere,ever....Tracer7,lower,comfier, bigger tank,etc...XSR flattracker, 115bhp like Kenny Roberts original TZ750....same can on the Tracer7, ¬£44 inc delivery from China!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Genial saludos cordiales desde Patagonia Chile

2,jVH9tKeKE38,Was it difficult finding one to buy? In the US they're basically unobtanium
2,jVH9tKeKE38,"Noooooooooooooooooooooo
The great thing on this channel was using a Scrambler to actually to some scrambling!"
2,jVH9tKeKE38,Love it
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"This was such a good video Doug. I‚Äôve been feeling the exact same way about the ‚Äúenthusiast‚Äù crowd around these cars and what these cars have become lately. The gt3 is essentially unattainable and the entire market has been saturated with people buying these cars to flaunt their wealth as opposed to what they‚Äôve always been, being the holy grail of the ultimate driver‚Äôs car. Hope to see more of their models start to trend this way in the future"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,That MC12 will be an awesome kickoff for Dougcember.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Porsche never fails to deliver world class products.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Keep in mind with an ecu tune these ‚Äúbase‚Äù 911s are able to reach over 500hp and also over 690nm so they‚Äôre  actually a really good car
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"100% agree! I drove an S and a T on the same day on a track. The T still hangs in my brain as the best car I've ever driven. The one I drove at the time even had the red door pull tabs to reduce weight. Coincidentally, it was the same canary color."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Keep making 911 variants please, I need to afford one someday and vast quantities will ensure that lol"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"You watch this guy for some time and you realize what a true enthusiast is. An honest to God, quirky, average guy, like you and me, being genuine, true to himself and the audience, telling things just as they are, no more, no less. I would like to approach life the way you approach cars Doug, like a true enthusiast.

‚Ä¶I also want a GT, red with white stripes, and drive the hell out of it."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"The 911, and porsche in general has by far the most complicated trim levels in the car business. It's absolutely ridiculous"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"At first I couldn‚Äôt believe the thumbnail, but his review is phenomenal.  I feel the exact same way.  Owned a 930 for twelve years 40k miles, amazing car, especially for looks.  However have owned a 981 GTS for 8 years and 60k miles and it is not even close.  Every category the car is at least twice if not 5 times better, except for only one matrix, looks.  So completely understand him pointing out the difference between a ‚ÄúCars and coffee‚Äù car and a drivers car.  I don‚Äôt necessarily like the looks of the 981 overall compared to the 930 or any 911, but driving is infinitely better and massively more enjoyable for me then sitting around at car shows."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I was looking for reviews of this car yesterday and thought to myself 'man.. Doug should review this.' And here we are. Keep up the great work!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Looks like a fun model!  Have a 992.2 C2 Cab and love it, plenty of performance, agility, handling...and commute every day in it.   Not a new money deviated stitching freak, for the record.  I'm in my 50s, and been into 911s since I was a teenager (long before I knew what deviated stitching was ü§£), and come from a long line of petrol heads"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Very interesting take by Doug here. Love his last line on which Porsche cars he would get despite the scoring.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I've always wondered why rear seat delete wasn't an option on all 911's. I'd rather have 2 seater sport car with extra storage space than a useless back seat. Carrera T with normal seats and a stick shift, no other options, would be my spec."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I feel like a 911 no-option GTS would be a better option than a a Carerra T with all these options.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,You are so right Doug.  I want a car that I can drive and enjoy every single minute of every day.  They can keep all the stitching and other options that add nothing to a driver‚Äôs car fahrvergn√ºgen.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Fun fact:  In a survey of the ultra wealthy the 911 was found to be the most popular sports car to be in collections of owners who had more nine or more vehicles in their collection even if they had other very high end sports cars in their stables. 
That‚Äôs how loved this design is. If I was blindfold in an empty lot I‚Äôd know I was driving one.  Wish I had one."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I've been a Porsche lover since I was in my early teens and got my first 911, a 78 SC, at 20 in 2003 but I haven't really cared about an 911s since the 996 or maybe the 997.  I was very lucky to be able to drive lots of Porsches starting at 16. My first experience with a 996 was when it first came out and I originally thought that was too big and soft but I had just gotten out of a 930 so that might have had something to do with it. I've come to really like the 996 and now have a C4 Cab.  I still like the air cooled cars more but the 996 is wonderful. I'm very glad I watched this video because I might just take a look at a T when before watching I mostly glossed over any new 911 stuff. I'm not sure I can bring myself to spend even that much on one but maybe the Porsche stitching buyers won't care about this and they will drop on the used market ü§îü§û"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Yep- I traded my GT4 to a dealer for a 911 T allocation. Why? The GT4 is a true track car - noisy to the point where I started wearing earplugs and too hard to get into and too small inside besides. I am 6‚Äô1‚Äù and 250 lbs - so there is that. But it is not a 911. In a 911 I can slide the seat back to where my feet don‚Äôt touch the pedals. In a 911 the dashboard is far away from you and the cabin is very inviting. The electronics are all state of the art- standard lab for example/ and a huge screen but the gt4 is old seven years ago design. And the gt4 rides hard all the time. While the 911 in comfort mode is just that comfortable- but in sport and at over 4,000 rpm it is a screaming race car. The gt4 is always harsh and hard - always. 

And this new T is fun to drive with a manual with downshift matching capability. So sort of like an automatic. 

And by the way the base engine is superb. It has smaller turbo blades than say the S or GTS - so the base engine spins up instantly - no taking a deep breath like the s or GTS does when you plant your foot down on the pedal on your he freeway or hitting a straight on a mountain road. 

The sport mode with this base engine makes fantastic back fire and popping noises when down shifting which get louder over time as the engine breaks in. A fantastic sound but the darn GT4 just howls but no pops and bangs etc- ever. The engine in the gt4 just kind of drones away - not pleasant to my ears.

The GT4 is designed to be driven for short periods of time on a track - but is too expensive and too pretty to chip and ding on a track. The T is designed to drive on a twisty country road or a mountain road which is where all us Porsche guys really drive our cars with our local porsche club.

And it is the ‚Äúreal ‚Äú Porsche - a 911 not a baby Porsche like the cayman. 

I do also own a 718 Boxster GTS and that is more fun to drive than the GT4. So trading the GT4 was easy emotionally - and I also get a new car.

Big question - Python green or GT Silver?"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Best friend's dad growing up had a 911 Carrera. The roof had to be left in the garage driving it here in Houston. It wasn't made for the heat. I got to ride in it a couple times. The engine was so cool looking. Like a jet engine or something. Oil cooled and the radiator was in the engine hood in the back. It had a huge Wing. Red. What I remember the most was his had asked what tape in my walkman. Got to listen to 311 debut album in a porch! What is cool was he was a neuro biologist at UT and was published in scientific American. A. Bit more than 20! years later... I was too And like üòÆüò≥. I love all you guys. In the future robots will be making all our shit. Handmade thing's like this will propel people to innovate with love and creativity. Doug should review my first car. A Subaru gL 1987 stick. It would admittedly be a boring video maybe he could tack it on a fun one. Sure, it wasn't a Porsche but it felt like it with the stick as a 16 Year old in the 90s with the windows down in October. nostalgic moment damn yo. üíóü´Çüíú"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"There was a time when the regular Carrera 2/ 4 models were bought by enthusiasts who wanted a fun car, while the GT3s were bought by people who really wanted to take them to the track and do some serious driving. It's so sad that nowadays the non-GT 911s are bought mostly by social media influencers and the GT products are bought mostly by wealthy as hell VIPs (because the cars are expensive as fuck) who either hide them away in the garage or take them to the Porsche meet to see who has the better spec. It's refreshing to see the Carrera T and this one spec'd in the way I'd spec it i.e. focused on driving. I'd go ahead and delete the rear-wheel steering too, to make it even more organic."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Can't wait for the MC12 review! If I were to get a more expensive sports car, it would be a 911 hands down."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I agree, my 996 4s is so much fun! Small, enough power and the stick which all makes it such an emotional driving experience!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I wonder what the dealer markup will be on this car. This is the 911 I'd want next to my 993. I agree with you on the way this one was ""speced ""as well! :)"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I can see this car being the starting point for a lot of tuners.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"""Reasonably practical (unless, of course, you decided to delete the rest seat)""
Couples without children or any intention to raise children: ""Are you kidding? There's more cargo space to carry things that way! We also don't have to let our friends ride in it."""
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Thank you Doug. You made the point and I do agree to what you said. Even over here in Germany it‚Äôs the same issue. The cars are getting larger and heavier. The real driving doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. üòäüëçüèª
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I agree with Doug completely 100% it‚Äôs all about how the car drives!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I‚Äôve got a 2020 992 S manual and it‚Äôs an amazing drive if you‚Äôre an enthusiast this would be a great car for you. Their driving ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô definitely overlook their quirks. Main quirks in the 2020 are rattles but the dealerships are handling pretty well. Imagine they are working on those.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I love the basic Porsches way more then the GT‚Äôs or S. Though we need them to bring the whale wing back! and having a classic small Porsche would be awesome, like the ‚Äò86 Targa‚Äôs"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I remember buying my 991.1 turbo for the same amount 8 years ago. Porsche prices are becoming ridiculous
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I was hoping you‚Äôd answer my question Doug: is the carrera t a successor of the carrera gts? They both seem to target the same segment and serve the same purpose.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"It's good to see the old T designation. My first Porsche was a beautifully restored '72 911T. It wasn't as fast as the E or the S, but damn it was fun. üôÇ"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Thank you for calling out all the posers!!! Exactly right right about stuffy spec owners!! Want the pure fun 911 993 driving experience!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Great review Doug. Loved the ‚Äònice spec‚Äô quip‚Ä¶ so funny and so true.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,The most beautiful car ever! It looks perfect from every angle unlike some ferrari cars  (because it doesn't have angles...maybe)
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Can someone tech savvy please make a supercut of Doug's impression of Porsche owners?!?!?!?
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Doug I want your take on a GTS with carbon buckets, rear seat delete and manual."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,These are actually affordable on the used market (100k) comparatively to other new 911 modes and most likely gonna be one I end up picking up in a few years
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I took my driver‚Äôs test in 1986 in a Porsche 911SC. I loved my 82 928 except it was a maintenance nightmare. Since then Porsche has become less quirky, offers far more features and has become near unobtanium. Thankfully the SC is still in the family. My Dad passed it on to my brother. I think today it is worth about $41,000 today. I like the 911T, but $151K? OMG. Might as well wear that Rolex on your cuff."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I love the 911. My favorite car! So many options. So many expenses. So many expensive options!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Great review.  Had they figured out how to put some type of  NA engine in there, they would have had a homerun."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"With all the 911s, you wonder about the significance of each model. This one is able to be optioned out as a cheap GT3. Why didn‚Äôt they just make everything standard? Weird. As for all of the options available, it makes the configurator on the Porsche website one of the most funnest things to do! Great review. Very advanced analysis. Doug used to work for Porsche, he knows their cars!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"After this review I'm left wondering what the point of this trim level actually is. It's only marginally less expensive than the Carrera S, but the Carrera S offers everything the Carrera T has, but it also has more equipment standard (which you can also get deleted as no cost options if you want the weight savings) and has almost 70 hp more."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Bold of a watch brand to branch out into motorsports. I hope it'll be successful for them
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Doug I absolutely love how much you make fun of the Porsche purists. Keep it up
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I always wonder, how far a Mustang GT500 is from a ""budget"" Porsche in terms of driving experience?"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,The down shift at 12:07 üôåüèæ
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Man great video Doug on the new T. I love all your insight on the model. I plan on getting one so my wife and I can drive around but have a 200 Lbs Boerboel Dog. And for that reason I‚Äôd love to know if he could fit in the back with the seats removed. Wish you could have your dog üêï get in the rear to see if he fits.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I think this doug score is the perfect example that proves your ""value"" numbers are out of whack.  You don't score expensive cars low enough."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Is this car similarly equipped to how a 911r would be? I kinda thought that was the m.o. of the R‚Ä¶ purist, stripped down for performance and enthusiast experience."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Cool cars. I always thought they looked like tree frogs about to jump.  THEY NEVER CHANGE THEIR STYLE..... EVER!!!!! üòÑüòÜ
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Perfect, almost.üíõ
This car needs sunroof, standard four directional leather seats and steering wheel, rear wheel steering, and delete the door decals.  Should be around $130k, give or take. ü§ë  Grey exterior with all red interior preferred. üëç"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Back in the days when I was young and had money, I drove a 1986 Carrera fast and hard and had so much fun until getting too many speeding tickets so I got rid of it! Looks like this T is the one to buy soon in my older age and I shall not drive it fast and hard!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Doug. I would say you are off on that car being the ‚Äúcorrect spec‚Äù. It‚Äôs overbuilt for a T. You are in decently equipped S manual MSRP range. Carbon roof specifically is/should be for a GT3. The T is about value. The sweet spot is probably 130-135k
The T interior pack loses all appeal with the bucket seat option. The upgraded normal leather saves a couple grand and is necessary so the dash and top of door panels don‚Äôt look like a base model Jetta."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Realistic dream car, cannot wait to spec one out"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Doug is so funny... the rolexes and the spec! love it
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"""Which 911 would you like?""
""Yes."""
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,imagine watching this video and being the guy who met Doug in real life and told him about his Porsche stichings
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Looking very much forward to the first 911 T deliveries!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"You can‚Äôt even come close to what a GT3 or GT3 RS can do unless you‚Äôre on a race track!
This is the perfect street car."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Ayoooo, he finally got the MC20! He can finally cross that off his list of cars he wants to review"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Ahh a drivers car for the driver that can't afford a drivers car to drive with.  Love it üòÄ
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Do those rear seats fit a car seat... if so, drop the stitching and the roof, keep the rear wheel steer and you are golden. Come on Doug, there is another good spec out there!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"It‚Äôs ridiculous, I look at the price thinking I could afford it, then the options and markups shatters my dreamüò¢"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Porsche 911 is a true jack of all trades sport car. It covers all areas very well and then some.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,The best car reviewer always with another banger
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,100% agree with you Doug!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Doug has been so catty lately and I am here for it. He has zero time for pretentious nonsense and neither do I.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I love when Dog demuro features Cars and Bids raising and moving his arms, he's like an inflatable dancing doll and frankly I love it, he just needs to look at the sky while raising his arms to make it look cooler. Caars and Bids, baby!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Hey Doug, question - which sport‚Äôs brand or sport‚Äôs model do you think people buy nowadays to actually drive it? I assume the group of people who buy cars for this reason migrated to another brand/model."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I keep falling in love with Doug every day lol.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"12:34 It's about the driving, not the spec... ‚ù§"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,The 911 Carrera T is something to consider.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Porsche snobs SMH. I was a Hoosier tire changer at the track SCCA. You definitely hit it on the headü§ô
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Doug, I don't understand why you don't appreciate the back seat. I know you're one child is just a baby, but when your child is 3 to 7 years old, you're going to enjoy bringing them with you in your enthusiast car. As are they!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Cool review, except for the fact that as usual Doug fails to realize that a car with unusable back seats is actually leas practical than a car without back seats.  Anyone ever just wanna throw their luggage, musical instruments into their sports car before going to the track and then the  hotel and getting laid later?"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,This vid is proof how Doug is THE best car reviewer out there today....
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Right with you on the driving.  Enjoying the details of a car is nice.  But having the details & tidbits, the name & 'symbol', etc as what someone cares about ... that's a loss.  Would much rather enjoy the car for what it is and what it does.  Stitching?  Who cares.  Special color or options?  Who cares.  A fancy name or badge you know others will envy?  Again, who cares.  A car that's hella fun to drive and own?  There ya go."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I never knew Doug used to work at a Ferrari dealership at 17!! That's the dopest job anyone could have at that age.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I bet having to be consistent (and being taken to the mat when you aren't) with your scoring across hundreds and hundreds of cars is probably one of the bigger drawbacks of doing the Dougscore.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,How would you compare this to the *GTS* model? It seems to be the middle ground between the T and the GT3
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,How does porsche keep giving legendary and class leaders  ‚ù§‚ù§. Another legend and class leader yet again .
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Now we just need a Carrera G and combine them for the ultimate supercar
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Thanks Doug, after this video I decided the GT3 to drive and to keep and the Carrera t to take out the tires and put the Km on it. üòÇüòÇInfondo le gomme ed il carburante spariranno.."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I love the way you trash all those rich kids/adults that have changed the meaning of owning a sports car for what is made for!üòÅ Thanks Doug.üëçüèª
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,I seriously think the rear seat delete improves the practicality of the 911. The rear seats in 911s just add weight and remove storage space... nobody gonna sit in those things. Vestigial rear seats are one of my biggest car pet peeves.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"So after watching this video Doug makes his criticism of ‚ÄúPorsche people‚Äù and their ‚Äúspecs‚Äù loud and clear. Its all about the specs and not the driving experience he argues. Curiously, if your going to buy this Carrera T make sure you spend the extra $40k to get it with the specs he so eloquently rattles off‚Ä¶yeah it‚Äôs clearly not about the specs!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"great video, love the t version of the 992"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Looks like you can easily get a great T for around 130k with great equipment. This one is loaded with nonsense.
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Dang Doug I'm convinced, I'll take one"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,AWESOME without the rear seats .. ready for a double dog cage and off to the woods with Pooch and Rex <3
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"‚ÄúI want something less touring and more performance-y, with more torque vectoring‚Äù

Dealer: Right this way‚Ä¶"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I bought a 2004 boxster S, and I‚Äôll probably never be able to afford a modern high performance model, but it is so much fun to drive. These videos keep me dreaming, though!"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,They Can Keep this Car! I wouldn't even bother looking into it...! Great gadget Inside! But I wouldn't pay the other extra! Is ridiculous...I rather stick with my 2022 911 Turbo S 992 Best Yet to come!
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Doug's gotta get a new scenery driving route.  That area around San Diego's Sorrento Valley around Freeway 5 and 805 is getting monotonous.  There are much better driving scenes in Cuyamaca, Palomar, and Ortega Hwy."
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"I placed an order for 911T here in Australia, with practically no options. Drive away price is $310k AUD üòÖüòÖ Gotta love the good old Luxury Car Tax in Ozüò¢"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,$5900 for factory sport buckets is a steal. Comparable aftermarket options can cost just as much or more
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,Thank you Doug!!!! I bought two of your mugs!! I'll send my email confirmation as proof!! üòÅüòÅ‚úäüëç
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,"Doug: Let's take it for a drive!

Also Doug: (stuck in traffic half the video)"
2,Iob9JbtBgU4,They actually should have used the NA engine from the Cayman GTS I think would make it more like a baby gt3
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Which performed best? VOTE BELOW!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Next time please do another down hill run with all the right settings for both cars, like you always do with drag races when there was an error on the first runüòÅ"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"For timeless looks, I‚Äôd say the Range Rover. But for off-road/ outdoor looks, that goes to the defender."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"At 4:28 I would have wanted to see a repeat of the hill descent control, but Mat always likes to win ü§†"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Really cool off road head-to-head. Really want the Hummer EV and Rivian to go head-to-head on this course and see how much range is left after doing some off-roading. Thank you carwow.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Regardless of the result, this is a great example of how important it is to understand how your vehicle works and how each program can effect your progression."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Darren's knowledge of what the different modes do to the car is so interesting, never knew about all that. Where is that information?"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Wow! Another awesome challenge to watch. I totally think the Defender should have won since it's mainly built for off-road hustle than a Range Rover that sways between luxury and off-road! All in all, it was so lovely to watch and thanks a lot guys for sharing an amazing challenge!!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"The tests that were done incorrectly with the Defender should've been done again, we need to see the full capabilities of both cars when used properly, and not when drivers select the wrong modes"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"A suggestion for a way to set up the scoring system, how about each cars start at the maximum amout of points for all the challenges and the aim is to work their way down so that by the end of it all we can easily tell which car did everything flawlessly(assuming a car had no points at the end of it all) and that way we can compare it to other cars that weren't in the same video as lower points are easier to remember than higher ones cause we dont know what the upper limit is. Cheers!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Sounds effect when Darren moves should always be included from now on! Brilliant! LOL
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,This is the best off-road challenge to compare turbochargers and superchargers when it comes to torque!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Don‚Äôt we all love a daily dose of watching carwow?‚ù§Ô∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You should do a video where Darren drives and shows you his skills üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"You should also have a session of REVS through off-road challenges, I love the engine sound as wellüòç"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,At this point Mat is just having fun in cars.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"You *DO* get instant torque with a supercharger, more so than with a turbo. Nick was just sleeping at the wheel the whole video."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Interestingly I work on these cars for a living and the suspension on the defender is very different, the defenders suspension is fairly similar to that on a Range Rover sport although it doesn‚Äôt have the same clever anti roll bars which help with articulation as they can be disconnected electronically, whereas the defender has old fashioned fixed anti roll bars therefore reducing articulation, they also don‚Äôt drive anything like a Range Rover although they‚Äôre pretty good still"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,These are the insane off-road challenges we love!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Love the new Defender but only with raised coil springs of course for durability.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"They might be equal in the artificial set , but when it comes to real off-roading , Defender kills it."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Really do love both, and their in one of my fav colours, apart from navy blue or Dark green.

But I'd choose the Landy, but on a short wheel base..."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Both of these vehicles are absolutely stunning. In my opinion, for that classic, timeless look and feel, the Range Rover. For a more rugged feel, the Defender."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Love the off-road testsüòÅ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You never seem to disappoint
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I would love to choose both because it's great for both rovers
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Time to find a tougher  circuit Matt
Great content, keep it up"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"It hurts to see the Range Rover lose on any of the obstacles. And more so when it‚Äôs damaged in any way! But, seeing Matt lose, üòä my day is made. Good day everyone."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I like that you adjusted the trail turn-around challange to test car capability instead of speed
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I can't say which one of those cars performed better, because you both made mistakes, so it's really not possible to say which was better. My advice is to set up both cars in the same way, then we could know something more, perhaps. I know Mat that you always want to win, but it doesn't work always like that üòÑ Thanks for the video."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Darren seems like a good dude
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"100% driver made the difference, Mat has way more experience of doing this and drove very smoothly. I reckon stick him in defender and it would have won more challenges."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,we just LOVE watching matt watson even tho we know we cant afford these cars right nowüòÖ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I am yet to finish the video but I am already unhappy about not re doing the down hill challenge. I don't understand matt's obsession to win. We are not here to see you win or boost your ego but to honestly understand the vehicles being compared.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,You guys are most welcome!! Was great to see how you guys do it! So much effort!! Stephen
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I'm so happy that those modes actually do something and aren't just for show
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"‚ÄúAre these cars pretty much the same..?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"This contests just proves that the despite its luxury car, appearance it still needs side rails to be capable as a true off road vehicles. After all, what good is its off-road prowess if it gets all dinged up in the process."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Would love to see how the Evoque compares the full size Range Rover on this course
I think the results could be surprising with the Evoque short wheelbase and lighter weight"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"for the team to be able to have any days off , they must be shooting a bunch of these on a single day. 
Imagine being Mat , a tough day at work doing this .."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"As capable as both cars might be, I can't get on board with the huge alloys and road tyres and this modern dependence on ""driving modes"". I'll take a an 80 series Land Cruiser with ARB lockers and a set of BFG 33s. And have about ¬£80,000 change. I'm sure I'll be hated for this but the old saying is true: Want to explore the wilderness drive a Land Rover. If you want to come back again, drive a Toyota."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"These are the two vehicles, every mechanic will tell you to stay away from."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,We need a drag race of these 2. Or a Sport SVR vs the new twin turbo V8 Sport.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Honestly if Daren didn‚Äôt tell Mat to be in the correct mode when coming down he would have lost. But Nick in the defnder didn‚Äôt get any help and had to do it himself or else defnder wouod win with the correct mode. So for me defnder wins
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"The defender won, the second obstacle was a fault from the driver."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Vote Matt Watson! Love to see him go up and down the hill üòÖ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Not only we enjoy watching your amazing reviews 
But you're so funny too üòÇüëçüèª"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,The defender wins. This was an important off-road challenge after all. Greetings from üá∫üá∏
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I agree the Range Rover is a Defender in a suit; however, the Defender has thicker independent suspension components which are ideal for violent offroading and desert dune bashing."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Does Nick lead another carwow channel? He's so composed in front of the camera, it's like he does reviews too."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Interesting to see a charity/ charity exec owning a c140k car‚Ä¶ not sure I would brag about that! I certainly won‚Äôt donate given they have that!!
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Carwow reviews, drag races, off-road challenges and videos make me go crazy!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Having had Range Rovers for 11 years, I decided to order a Defender P400 90 in 2021.  After waiting 9 months and running it for six months, the conclusion: it ain‚Äôt a Range Rover!  Sold it; bought a Range Rover‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.best car in the world!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Awesome vehicles (face it, I‚Äôll never be able to afford either üòÇ) Does beg the question why / who paid for a charity to own a Range Rover V8 ü§î"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Driver error caused the tie, so the win goes to the Defender. Not that I‚Äôd feel like I lost with the big Range‚Ä¶"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Even thought I‚Äôm not a Jaguar-Land Rover person, I‚Äôd still go with the Defender overall when it comes to off-roading. It just has that off-road look and capability to it. The Range Rover is just too luxurious to off-road imo ~"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I would like to see the Cayenne go through this challenge
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Awesome, that's comparison we all want, loved it‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"So happy you did this comparison, makes sense if you going to buy a reputable 4x4. However sorry Matt, it was the Defender!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Definitely gonna donate to a charity that needs 100k range rovers üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I think the driver plays a big part in the scoring. These 2 drivers have a different level of skill
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Adding the Suzuki Jimny to the off-road drag races would make it quite more interesting.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I've been thinking, are those smooth cars built for off-road use?"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,And I thought I was the only one who would take the Rover offroading! üòÇüòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Let talk a-bit about the engines that get sea-sized and and the warranty issues you get with dealers plus them being very easy to steal üòâdont make it look nice we know what it is matt
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"defender is made for off-road, and range rover is made for luxury,
Concslusion: both are best in their segement and defender performs better in this challange"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Defender. The hill descent and one before the last challenge should have been draws/wins giving it the win. Drive modes aren't the cars fault üòã
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Been Waiting for this ! Being from a country where I can apply these cars and my love for elegance, I choose Range Rover. However, not much difference between them."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Which one wins!? depends on your pocket. when they are both have the same drivetrain, its up to ur tasting on the shape size, style, etc.. but i personally go for the rangey, even tho i cant afford it. but thats my shape üòÅ"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Matt, you need to do 4x4 offroad water test to see if it would die under water or survive it. ü§£"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Thanks for this amazing offroad battle, Carwow!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I think both are equally winning. But I never knew that Mud ruts keeps wheels better on ground than Rock crawl mode where wheels move individually. Damn that Terrain response system. All Land Rovers are computers on wheels, besides that they doesn't solve maths."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both of these are fantastic looking cars but the defender for me all day ‚ù§Ô∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Both my favorite üî•üî•üòçfor off-road defender and luxurious range rover üòç
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,It's very hard to say both SUV are winners in my book it's just a deference which a person love more or best üëçüëç
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,This had to be one of the most toughest and closest comparisons ever on this channel
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Someone needs to explain why mud and ruts is preferred over rock crawl on an articulation obstacle like that. It was my understanding that rock crawl opens the crossover valves and allows for better flex and articulation‚Ä¶
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,It would have been nice to see the defender do the hill descent with the proper settings again.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,it would be interesting to know how much it cost to repair the scratched side skirt of that range rover
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Hi Matt, You always go last and it generally works out for you. Next time why don't you start or randomly select the first to go on each challenge (except hill descent control and climb)?"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,The V8 Defender has a more road orientated suspension (anti-roll bars etc). Would be good to see a Defender P400 v the equivalent Rangie.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"So in essense, to compare these two cars this whole video has to be redone with Darren driving both, as it seems the main deciding difference is the driver knowing which button to push in which scenario..."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Amazed that they finished the race without breaking
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,the fact that a range rover matches or beats a land rover defender off road is a testament to how far the defender has fallen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Darren really knows what he's doing.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I won‚Äôt tear my hair out when I‚Äôd scratch a plastic door part in the Defender. üòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Hi Mat Loved your content Love from India ‚ú®üî•
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"It is like a battle in between AbramsX üá∫üá∏ vs T14 Armata üá∑üá∫ 

Both are phenomenal!"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"I am addictive to watching Carwow, lifted up my mood all the time, every time(Yanny). Shout out to all the Aussie üëèüèªüëåüèªüëçüèª"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Defender came away with no bodywork damage so that's the winner for me.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I was really hoping the land rover would win but i guess it is what it is.
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,I would like to see the Defender against the Discovery ‚ÄºÔ∏è
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,It was the Range rover I loved the most üî•üî•
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,Those two cars are just awesome in the offroad even with the low profile tyres..
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Next time you guys have a tie, you should do a Road Drag race as the decider ;)"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"Wow, India really make good cars. Bravo! Love from Japan."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"as an american i freakin love these two cars, im partial to the defender v8 though"
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,"if the Range Rover has 295mm clearance, and the Defender only has 291mm and they both have 28¬∞ breakover angles then how on earth can Darren possibly give the point to the Defender in the forest turn section, based on clearance? it's literally a mathematical unfairness."
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,3:43 üòÇTHAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME üòÇüòÇ
2,RwaNGQcUhU4,The Defender defends it's title as the MOST Daddy ASF off roaderüòè

2,hgzh1AtAa0E,This is just wholesome American human interaction.

2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"I love how the husband and wife are just on the same page...living life together... awesome üëç and so curious,"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Props to them for wanting to learn
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,‚ÄúThey just keep getting better‚Äù like when the whole car falls apart after 5 years
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,The important thing is that charging at home overnight gives you a full ‚Äútank‚Äù. People are so fixated on fuel being something you drive to and that you need to be ready for it to catch you off guard.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I appreciate how both sides had a civil conversation about something . This would have been a totally different situation if both weren‚Äôt being ‚Äúneighbors ‚Äú to each other .
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"It‚Äôs so nice to see a person who would look like they‚Äôd just assume the worst of what they don‚Äôt know, but they‚Äôre actually opened minded enough to actually ask a person who owns a Tesla and the capabilities of it ‚ù§"

2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Thank you for being someone who explains and helps them I see a lot of people getting mad and ignoring them they just wonder and have questions
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,A really wholesome moment :) no bashing just a genuine curiosity without opinion taking over. Wish everyone was like this üôè
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,What a wholesome conversation! You know right when they walked away they were like‚Ä¶ we ain‚Äôt never gonna get one of them teslas! üòÇ
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Reasonable people having a normal conversation. Sooo refreshing to hear on youtube
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Actual conversation I‚Äôve had before. Just polite and normal answering questions about the Tesla ownership process
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"This was the cutest video ever. Love to see country folk interact with city folk. It's pretty awesome.  I love this country and the people in it, regardless of race. We are all God's children."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"""The carbon footprint is terrible and the batteries only last a few years until they need replacing at immense cost""

Is what he should have finished up with"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,200 range is great for $10. Perfect for UK I would say. I know Elon is developing the battery charger stations where you just drive in and it changes the entire battery so you get a fresh one already charged
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"This is literally the best Tesla video I‚Äôve ever seen. When technology crosses from early adopter to everyone else, that is absolutely huge. These people were so genuinely curious and allow you to share your knowledge."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"That was such a wholesome and genuine conversation, sweet!"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"‚ÄúSo let me ask you this, do you start panicking when you need a place to charge?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNah bro I don‚Äôt even panic when I see the kids in China mining this shit.‚Äù"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,As a Tesla owner - I can tell you the charging on long trips is the only major drawback of the Tesla.  Its a great car in the city.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Finally, people of seemingly different backgrounds having a normal conversation regarding something that divides other people. And those other people are exactly who the media seek out to showcase their biased agendas, on both sides."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"I'm a Southerner myself, we're all very nice but people don't see it that way üò≠"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I‚Äôm glad they were open minded about this. There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation for EVs right now
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,These the kinds of folks who will come out and greet a new neighbor with food and real neighborly love
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Dude seemed genuinely interested. I hope he can buy his kids one one day
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,This is exactly how this should go. Just a couple of curious people and a gentleman who induldged their conversation. Need more people like you sir. I dont agree with EV yet the battery tech just isnt good enough for me to be on board due to them being lithium. Its a dead product once its made and sits in landfills. Atleast with gas engines you can melt em down and make new ones.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Next version is said to have a pedal system that allows you to charge the vehicle while driving or at a stop. The Dutch Libraries were the inspiration behind this idea.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,How polite both of yall were. That was such refreshing content it's hars to even explain how enjoyable this was.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,One question they forgot to ask was how long the battery will last before needing replacement and how much it will cost to replace it. That's the desk breaker for me in the end.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"It's nice to see, how friendly people can talk to each other about stuff, that normally ""woke"" people try to scream in your face."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"This is one of them cool interactions where you both walk away having learned something new, with a little bit of faith restored in humanity"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Not a fan of EVs(right now). 

But I do appreciate how polite an informative he was."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Great conversation. Questions and answers without snarkiness.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Man, can't remember how many times I had to explain this to people when I owned my Tesla"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"They asked all the right questions, gotta respect that ü§ô"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"When this is just a normal interaction most people have, but it's like seeing a caveman to the internet. ü§£ü§£"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"As someone who wants an ev,

I don‚Äôt think we should force evs on everyone but it would be nice to dispel some of the misinformation, just put them on the market and let people decide what‚Äôs best for themselves"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Props to that guy for being respectful and not just dissing people for asking genuine questions üëè
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Just wondering if in the full video, you were honest with these people, and told them how much the car cost, and how long it would take to charge if they didn't have access to a supercharger."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,They‚Äôre really interested because their son wants one so much. These are great parents
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Definitely nice for road trips if you have extra time to kill for charging stations, but I would personally be too nervous about running out of juice, and I've seen videos of people in line to charge, as in several hours of wait time."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,They just keep getting better...made me laugh HAHAHA
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Isn‚Äôt cool what you can learn when you keep an open mind and ask questions rather than make assumptions and running with them?
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,‚ÄúNo wonder why my boy‚Äôs want one‚Äù lmao
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"""It costs about $10. . .not counting the loss of charge from the car just sitting in the parking lot"""
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Damn curious, polite and nice farmer folks. That‚Äôa so cute how they‚Äôre interested"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Teslas may seem expensive, but they're actually cost effective and the ultimate savings car. No paying $100 on gas every week, no oil changes, no engines failures."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"‚ÄúSon, I lived just fine with my truck and my toothpick‚Äù Is what everyone expected him to say"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I appreciate people that are curious and open minded.  Good for them and good for @Gjeebs honestly answering their questions.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Information is definitely key,  I don't exactly support evs  But if implemented correctly With alternative power sources it makes sense"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"I mean... I start panicking when my gas gauge needle is below the first thick line, I'd assume you'd also panic if your Tesla was running low üòÇ"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Thanks for posting this. Makes my day to see this rather than constant slandering
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"The only downfall is if something came up and you had to get somewhere fast.

 Depending on where it is, your gonna be leaving your Tesla charging somewhere and hitching a ride if your battery isn't fully charged"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Great questions actually, very informative replies! Learned something myself!"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"This is how its supposed to be!!!
You can tell they are From completely different parts of the demographic chart, and they are asking questions about something they know nothing about. 
Imagine if this happened with a lot of different classes of people, on different subjects."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Southern brother, he was curious might even get himself one üò≠"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"My dad did the same thing to a stranger owning a Tesla at a charge station, he was so surprised to learn all the benefits about EV cars.. he shared the information with his friends and one said ‚Äú i heard a crack windshield on an ev can take months to replace it‚Äù. Then all of them agreed its a shit invention.. yes they were all republicans and believed something they heard instead of something being shown to them"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I wouldn't mind having one for the wife in city usage.  I love long trips in the Tundra.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I just love how respectful and curious they were.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I love how he is so interested and not what media shows
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Some people want to learn I'm always happy to help. Learning is fun of someone's asking they're interested and you've already won.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"I like videos like this, don‚Äôt need to flex, couple have genuine questions and no arguing and bitter attitude over EVs and how they suck and all that non sense."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Now the real question: How long does that car last before the battery cell pack needs to be replaced. Google says 15-20 years,  seems like a bad investment. A gas car can last 50, 100, maybe even more"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,i thought he was trying to trip him up but he was genuinly interested. nice to see a wholesome human interaction
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Idk why but people just talking to each other and being nice is just heart warming.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"When they make a tesla with a manual transmission, I'll get one."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I love the respect. I know for a fact farmers love gas/ diesel because they can keep em going but everything eventually will be ran off of electricity. Maybe not in his lifetime but eventually.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Assuming the actual driving time to be the same, a 600-mile trip (besides the drive time) would require three stops to regain 200 miles of range each at an average of 20 minutes each. As long as the charges are all working and available when you get to them,  that's about an hour for charging. A gas-driven car would need only TWO refills at an average of 6 minutes each (assuming working,  available pumps). That's 60 miles vs. 12 miles. Can everyone afford the extra 48 minutes just sitting and waiting?
The charging/battery infrastructure/speed/efficiency has to improve."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Good to see so many nice people just communicating about simple stuff~
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,That's awesome how they actually wanted to learn about it.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,That was a cool interaction man. Doesn‚Äôt happen very often anymore.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I wonder how long and how many times it would take to charge a tractor to plow a 400 acre field? Or how much it would cost to charge a semi truck? These cars are cute. Pretty sure guys are not using them to haul lumber or concrete. Gonna need a lot of coal to power this plan.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Nice to see some people interaction without screaming and a lawsuit.

Remember when that was actually the norm?"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,This is such a great sales videos if it was one lmao YALL ASKING ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS üòÇ
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,they need a 500 mile run to make  me even think of thinking of buying one !!
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,We need more electric utility companies to increase competition to lower prices and install utility built chargers. Free charging if you're a customer in their area. That's what we need because just one utility company will jack prices up.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"It's definitely not just $10, some old articles place it around $16-20, and the range can be as low as about half that of a tank of gas in something like a Civic or Camry, so not exactly a huge savings."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"When I used to work at a call center, southerners were the nicest people I would talk to. They always sound so kind"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"I love how they didn‚Äôt attack him being electric. Im all for gas cars, but I like electric too damnit"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"so long as people don't want to get an electric car to be ""green"" they are really quite unique! 
as the power comes form non green sources"
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Dude confirmed what we all know about EVs. Also, go to Alaska and interview a Tesla driver..."
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I wonder if they had the some questions at the time where Mobility changed from horse-drawn carriages to petrol carriages...Don't you panic to find gas???
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,Finally a decent conversation between decent people... Don't see that every day
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I love how genuine the question are
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I love the curious southerners! They‚Äôre the best cause they‚Äôre wanting to learn and form their own opinion.
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,I‚Äôm with Andrew tate on this one they want to be able to shut our cars down ü§£
2,hgzh1AtAa0E,"Simple interaction between good people, was a joy to watch. I was wondering how that worked also..."
2,JmmDMbth8KM,I‚Äôm constantly amazed at how josh is just living the dream soaking in everyday doing his thing. And yet hanging with what our generation would consider some of the ‚Äúbig leagues‚Äù because well‚Ä¶. WHO WOULDNT WANT JOSH AROUND?? He‚Äôs the üîå the homie and the legendüëåüèº
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"This probably my favourite era of this times, all of my favourite car YouTubers are all together in 1 vid of each every individuals and contents. Really loving it tbh!!

Stay safe out there guys!! Iloveyou all‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

Love from the Philippines‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"That R34 you guys were looking at towards the end of the video belongs to Takashi-san I believe. That R34 is well known in Japan, they even did a Speedhunters article on it and featured it in numerous videos on Youtube. It's a well crafted R34 that is almost all custom made in parts. It's actually an ER34 GT-T but he did such a great job building it that it looks like a GT-R"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"If Randy has this much energy now I can't imagine how he was like as a little kid! Thanks for sharing, Josh."
2,JmmDMbth8KM,üòÇüòÇüòÇ man when in doubt randy pulled it out!!! Haha you guys are way to funny and the content is fire üî• just some true people doing what they love! Thanks for vloging Josh! Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next‚Ä¶ hopefully the S15!

2,JmmDMbth8KM,Thank you for sharing all this cool content! Always looking forward to the adventures!
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"This has been the best time for JDM car content ever.  Randy needs to move to Japan now, and you, Kota, and him always make your videos together.  Featuring special guests like Sammit, Jeff, and Albo."
2,JmmDMbth8KM,Date Night: Literally brings all the boys out lmaooo
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"I love watching your content with your R34, because my dream car is a 34 GTT as well. I currently own a S15 that I love but the 34 GTT is like the 1 car I'd replace it with. Keep up the content! 

Also, I'd love if you made some R34 GTT POV driving videos!"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,Pumping out these videos like crazy ü¶æ love to see it
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"Typically those guys run the hondas all night, so when they pull in and park for a few minutes they pop the hood to help cool it down faster before going back out. Watch a few no-good racing videos. Guys are insane out that way on the streets! Nice seeing you guys all together creating content! ü§ô"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"Gidday Josh,great vid and thanks for sharing .That 34 was pretty cool,which is hard to do in Japan as there is so many.But custom work always adds when done well.Look at Max Orida's .Leah will have her car soon,4drs come up looking good.Thanks again."
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt win it, so I joined him‚Äù 
- Leah, 2022"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"Mr. Josh, what is the time difference between the regular route (which you say is 2 hours) vs expensive route? how long of a drive is it for expensive route? just curious"
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"Josh: Talks about how expensive everything is 
Josh: Proceeds to buy 30 more cars 
Good city vlog brotha‚Äô ü´°"

2,JmmDMbth8KM,I'm not even gonna lie half the reason I watch your videos is your wife .... your a lucky dude!
2,JmmDMbth8KM,"Randy is the type of guy who is friends with lots of YouTubers. I wish I can meet you all. So far, I only met Dustin Williams."

2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Heating can be controlled from steering wheel and annoying beeps and loud indicator sound can be fixed in settings. Props to my local dealer - he‚Äôd watched all the YouTube reviews and it was the first thing he told me when I took a test drive. It‚Äôs excellent and I want one!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I know you love your exotics Rory but your reviews of lesser cars are outstanding - your understanding of what real people want is something most testers miss.üëç
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"The heating control is just on/off (it says that on the button).
Press the top of the screen (where the temp is shown) or swipe down and you'll get a set of controls that don't disappear (or use the button on the steering wheel).

All models have parking sensors at the rear (not at the front though)."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Here's a question about 'one-pedal-driving' in general but not about the MG on test.
If I use full regenerative braking and the car slows to a stop, do the brake lights come on as the car does so?"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Nice car. I could see myself in one - but ¬£30K isn't cheap, and the standard model sounds very different."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"You forgot to mention the fact that there's no rear central headrest... Quite a dealbreabker for a 2022 car and the cheap cost of putting one of those. The risk in case of an accident is quite high if you don't have a headrest. For my family it's probably the dealbreaker that crosses out this car, sadly, because we love it"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Rory, loving your work as ever. I‚Äôve seen several top reviews for this car but I‚Äôm worried because it‚Äôs so cheap, that it‚Äôs NCrAP rating is minus 19 because it‚Äôs made from tinfoil? Discuss.."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"While there is no question that MG has come out swinging for the fences and have succeeded in doing so, the non-cancelling driver aids and that insanely annoying constant beep is unacceptable. One shouldn't have to cancel it every time one gets in a vehicle. It should always be a choice of whether one wants that extra protection. Many of us actually focus entirely while behind the wheel and don't require a nanny to tell us off when we decide to take an apex and swing out a little wide because we can see there is the space to do so. If I were forced to own one, I would dig around to find the bastard beeping at me and beat the crap out of him until he stfu. =)"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks great. Love the concept and it's a step in the right direction. But, we need to see something reasonably priced with 300 miles range on a cold wet motorway drive üëç
I'm sure with the Chinese arrival in force it'll happen."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Raining and no rear wash wipe.
See the irony?
The lack of this useful safety related feature fitted for YEARS gives a peak into the odd minds of the decision makers inside MG 
Fashion won over practicality and common sense.
Unforgivable.
And Rory why didn't you call them out on this?
And that beeping, heating controls etc..designed to distract the driver.
Good grief
A fine design ruined by stupidity."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Having tried this car I agree it's pretty good for the money, but it's not helpful to potential buyers to get some of the facts wrong, ie the price, the wheel size and boot comparison size with other makes. Just correct it in the edit as others do."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"you can program the rh star button to control the climate control. I've got the SR model (with LFP battery) and I don't have the same issues about the infotainment system. it's not perfect and many functions reset on every start up, software update needed."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£25,995 starting price, not 24 ...  and 17"" wheels ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

I have an SE SR in Camden Grey ... and I love it. üôÇ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Rejected mine due to the oil leak and warped under tray plus all the other issues like over sensitive ‚Äòsafety‚Äô features. 
The storage bits in the rear of the front seats are only in the Trophy model.
Car drove really well and rapid charging speeds were faster than claimed, saw 143kW charging!
Not very efficient, 3.8mi/kWh where my Ioniq 38 was getting 5.4mi/kWh driven over the same route at the same time."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,WARNING: I work in the port of Zeebrugge where many new cars arrive and are moved between docks all day. I‚Äôve never seen so many cars break down as the MG‚Äôs. Often seen multiple per day on the side of the road with a technician with it. So there is clearly a reliability issue somewhere‚Ä¶
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"To be sat on my drive, a car has to tick a box in the good looks department.  I could never own a car that, in my opinion, was odd looking.  This is odd looking."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Just test drove one today, really great car! When you look at the price it‚Äôs an amazing EV"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"A generally good review but quite a few wrong facts...

Rory says they start at at ¬£24999...actually it's ¬£25995 for the SE..he says the Trophy is ""just over ¬£30,000"" ...it's actually ¬£31,495 for the blue or white and increasing extras for the other colours up to ¬£35190 for the orange as tested....a bit more than ""just over ¬£30000""....still excellent value though

Instead of pressing the button at the bottom to bring up the HVAC screen and it disappearing after 2 seconds...just press the very top of the screen where it shows AC and the temp display and you will find the screen stays on all the time.

It does have rear sensors...on my Trophy, as well as the rear cam view being displayed, it also beeps with increasing urgency the nearer you get to an obstacle ...just like normal rear sensors.

Had mine 3 weeks and loving it so far. :)"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"nice one Rory. Pity here in South Africa so far the cheapest EV is the Mini and Haval (introduced about 2 months ago) the rest are still out of reach for average consumer (Porsche, BMW, Merc, Audi and Volvo). Will eventually get there"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Another great review Rory, Top man!! But, I'll stick with my Diesel all the same."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Seen one yesterday and it looked better than on pictures or video.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Excellent review, always enjoyed Rory on what I reckon was the dream team on Top Gear with him, Chris and Matt.

The infotainment seems a bit shonky, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fixable with an update. 

You can‚Äôt touch the value though, and also worth noting you could actually buy one of these today if you wanted, not an option for the majority of cars, particularly EVs."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"My dad has one and he was trapped in it for 15 minutes. Then the car let him out. My sister drove it and she was trapped inside it for nearly 2 hours. The engine wouldn‚Äôt power off, the windows wouldn‚Äôt come down, the doors wouldn‚Äôt open. Recovery had to come out smh. It‚Äôs happened 5 times so far. The car keeps trapping people inside. My dad is getting a refund. Rubbish."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"What I do not understand is why EVs are held to a different standard than ICE vehicles. At the end of the day, one is purchasing a mode of transport and the drivetrain is irrelevant. These vehicles are not cheap is pure car terms. The MG4 may be lower priced than similar EVs from other manufacturers but compared to ICE vehicles they are very expensive. If the MG4 came with a petrol engine and cost ¬£30K it would be lambasted as overpriced and poor value. We really need to move away from this almost religious fervor around EVs. EVs are not good, they are simply a less bad form of vehicle in terms of emissions. This does not even begin to cover the concerns around their manufacture and use of rare earth minerals. I am not anti EV, just think we need a reality check."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"MG has quickly become one of the best-selling brands in the Middle East, even beating out big-wigs like Toyota and Chevrolet in certain segments. In no time, MG will once again become a household name in the UK."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Oh, dear. Legacy marques could really be in the crap now. An affordable electric car that's not only adequate for most people, but actively desirable in many ways."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"*sigh* 
It does have rear parking sensors, only the drivers seat is electric, and the heating controls are accessed in a variety of ways, none of which are double tapping the button! 

(also you have the earlier version with the annoying 'driver fatigue' sensor on the steering wheel which was removed a while ago.)

What MG DO need to fix is that the driver assist functions stay turned off when they're disabled. Some of mine do.. and some don't!

I'm also getting about 3.5 miles per kwh motorway driving in 5 degree weather wind and rain. Happy with that!"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Great review by Rory, I very much like how he reported the usability limitations with the infotainment system.  Balanced.
Things like that would drive me crackers I think, but that aside what a statement of intent by Chinese automakers!"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The front end is clearly inspired by the C8 Corvette and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not actually that bad
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Having no true One Pedal driving is a deal breaker for me. It's the best thing about driving an EV in the city
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"I've been waiting for you to do this one Rory, an I've heard a lot of good talks about it."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,My Fiat 500e also used to regularly provide similar over-cautious warning messages they have diminished with time.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"No rear wipers & they can't put in reversing camera as standard , even though it would probably only cost less than ¬£5"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Rory; you are a gem. Don't stop.  I just wish a certain AutoExpress reviewer could watch and learn how to mix humour with proper information.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Until the end of the video where you said this might be the best FAMILY car for the price, I swear I thought it was a small hatchback."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Motorized vents have been standard on Teslas for years - did I miss something?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"id love one, they will be every where surely on a cheap lease"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,180 actual miles vs a claimed 280 mile range! Constant bleeping when you‚Äôre driving! No parking sensors on the top range model! Do not buy this car until these basic ‚Äòproblems‚Äô are solved by the Chinese manufacturer!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would buy an id3 at this point.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks like an Urus if you blink a lot, surround it with thick fog and you have a chronic eye condition. For the price point, fine way to get on EV scene for cheap and avoid the taxi man prius"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"If I was in the market, I'd be tempted to take a good look at this ..."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Another great review rory !  üî•
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The only Company who can rival and out perform MG in terms of good value for money product is BYD.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Thanks for the thorough review!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"At 25K, it's almost affordable on a 4-5 PCP. This should sell well."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"There are a lot of pluses, but that beeping would drive me nuts after a while and what no climate control knobs! That is simply dangerous. The weather in this country can change in minutes. You can't be looking at a touch control screen to adjust the temperature. Definitely a deal breaker for me."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Nice video! But there were some errors and missing information, I just got a MG4 Trophy so I can confirm you first hand the following:
1) AirCon: you use that button under the screen to turn it on/off,  you pressed it twice because it was already on. You can access to that aircon screen touching the upper part of the screen, where temperature and fan speed are always shown, or from the climate button on the right side of the screen in the home menu. Using one of those two ways the screen will stay on climate setting, so you'll have all the time you want. Also the right star button on the steering wheel allows you to control temp and fan from there. Buttons are easier to operate but it's not that bad
2) 17"" alloys
3) drowsiness alert is the one beeping, is a known problem and MG is releasing soon an OTA soon, that's what my dealer told me when I collected the car few days ago. You can turn it off and it will stay off when you restart the car, same for lane keeping assist and preference on star button. Although regen and driving mode will reset to 3 (max) and Normal and the restart, that's annoying and I hope they will fix it as well
4) Regen has also the ""auto"" setting, changing the regen intensity according to speed
5) I didn't try to get 0-60 mph as fast as I could but it should be less than 8 seconds (you said 7 in the video). Anyway is pretty quick and the rear wheel drive gives it a really sporty feeling 
6) on the Trophy there are sensors at the back for sure, if you put it in reverse it will show you them in addition to the camera views. Not completely sure on the front, but you have a good idea where the front of the car is, so doesn't bother too much.

Anyway, I think it's a really good car, great experience for me so far, go and have a test drive by yourself, it's worth it."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"You can scroll down from the top of the screen to use AC controlls, it won't disappear in 2 seconds and you can also set shortcuts on the steering wheel to control it. So unfortunately you're wrong when you complained about that."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I've heard there will be a hot hatch version 0-60 under 4 secs coming soon.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Cheap? Immediately rules out the vast majority of the driving population. The trickle down of affordable used electric cars is years away for most people and then they will have to contend with the battery degradation. Questionable if its an ethical purchase given its origin.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I hear people say they don't like the design but in person they're a real head turner at the moment. I imagine that will fade with its success.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"*""Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.""* ---Winston Churchill"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"FYI guys, ‚Äòfake leather‚Äô is now called ‚Äòvegan leather‚Äô these daysü§£"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Like most Chinese cheaper products it is let down by software. I bought a cheap brand Chinese tv once because the specks were good, but the software was atrocious. I love the look of this car and the reports on the drive, but I know I couldn't live with sub par software."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Fantastic Review - thanks Rory.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"A few tips for you, you can set the car to enable the heating controls from the steering wheel. You can turn the beeps OFF for the driver awareness system and they don't turn back on after restart. The wheels are 17"" not 18"".
Otherwise, I agree with everything he said, it's a great car to drive at exceptional value."

2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Single tap for the heating, the second 'double tap' is a lagged response which removed the screen"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Love that Rory's embracing this economy drive, what with the cheap MG and the Salvation Army jeans, he's really setting a good example for the rest of us...üòâ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks ok from the outside, interior is just a dark dungeon.  The build quality is simply appalling, purchase one at your peril!"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£25,000-¬£31,000 ‚Äòcheap‚Äô for a small car even if it is an EV?! üòÇ"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Poor old Rory going from a TTRS iconic to an MG lmao
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Interesting EV!  Also noticed a new Roly on your wrist!!!  New edition? Or did you trade in your two-tone Rolex??
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I like your humour. hubcap and open the roof great. Is the voice control also on the standard 51 kWh version?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Waiting for the sedan version...
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,A true driver don‚Äôt need parking sensors üòÇ and yes the beeps are annoying but I love the car.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The Lambo+prius+clio thing ü§Æ .p.s. nice stearing wheel
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Ordered a trophy model in white. Pick it up first week in Jan

2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"""teslas dont need it...SHUT UP!!"" ü§£ü§£"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"It looks like a gr yaris, a smooshed huracan and a rav4 all at the same time"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,We are lucky enough to have a third family car for Town use and dogs etc...currently a 3008 hybrid due to replacement in July...this all electric is excellent value and will be on list
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"The boot is not bigger than the boot of an ID3. And not sure about the 0-60 time you mention. Other reviewers say the seats are too soft and not supporting. I hate the rear design, but this car could definitely become a game changer. Great value for money."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"¬£32k for trophy, cheap? Cheaper than EV rivals but not a cheap car. That word brings bad connotations. It‚Äôs a proper car better than most petrol hatches. Shows how cars need to be made if we are to go fully electric and reduce emissions, ha the irony."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Well done, Thank you very much."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Great review
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Love watching this dude ! We've got ours lol. But umm the car is a nope lol
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Nice video. Never seen 14s review before.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"It's beeping because you're a crap driver! üòÑ. The sports model will feature a sunroof, camera door mirrors and 4 wheel drive - with two motors that'll propel it to 60mph in around 3-4 seconds."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I hope everyone in the comment section owns their dream car one day.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Commooon Rory...I've got electrically controlled seats in a vintage benz I just bought. Make me understand why i should fork out 30 big ones for this?!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Averaging 3 miles / KWh?  Typical Rory... a real MG4 owner who's done 1000 real miles in his (40% motorway / 60% other) has achieved over 4 m/KWh.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,We need this car in America. It would sell out completely.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Looks like a 70s Hot Wheels car.
Why not?"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Very cool üî•üî•
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,isnt Dacia Spring the cheapest on the market?
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,The ID4 guy design the climate control system/software üòÇ
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Starts at ¬£25,995. ""A little over ¬£30k"" well it's 7% more than ¬£30k starting at ¬£32,040.00"
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Think the mg4 starts at ¬£25995 and also all mg4 have 17inch alloys not 18 inch.also 0-62 is 7.9
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,Looks nice
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I think we should set up a crowd funding page to buy Rory some new trousers.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,ID.3 has 385 litres of boot space.
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,I got to say the hubcap throw was so funny ü§£
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,That's a nice watch by the way!
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,First glance at the thumb nail I thought it was a lambo üòÖüòÖ
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Why would anyone pay 25k for this shizzle when you can buy used cars which are top spec. Insurance doesn‚Äôt differ that much as well if you have enough experience. And if money was really a problem you wouldn‚Äôt be paying for a new car, you‚Äôd be buying a used (2 to 5 yr old) car. So insurance increase of 100 or 2-300 shouldn‚Äôt be that much dent."
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,It does have rear parking sensors
2,m-SjlE2mnkE,"Fantastic, cheap car, only ¬£30K!  Real bargain...?  Rory, why only ever top-spec cars?  Come on, get a pleb mobile and test that.  I think the beeps are good for driving using one's phone though, you can keep in lane using them whilst watching the footie.  I like the Austin Allegro steering wheel, it was defo before its time at the time.  Looking forward to using those controls in an 8-year-old car, bet they will all work, with no dead spots/cracks in the screen and no failed online updates.  We are looking at built-in obsolescence big time, it will make rusting BLMC cars seem like they would last forever...."

The builder Mike from T.O.B (The Other Bike) uses a bunch of RC car batteries connected to make his batteries, instead of using individual cells which are way stronger, he's trying to say that the owner of the e-Bike caused it by sticking foam inside to stop it from moving around, with the builder being full aware of it, I think he's the one that suggested it, but he's saying there what caused the fire, instead of his sub par batteries he builds, I really hope for the sake of his lil company he makes this right with this guy!!! üíØüëç"
2,efKjSroQeDM,So did this guy actually remember to call 911 or did someone a bit more focused do it for him? Can't believe anyone would just stand there next to their e-bike ON FIRE and do nothing.
2,efKjSroQeDM,"I found your channel almost a month. I will say I'm not a rider myself, but I use your videos as an educational tool to be more aware of my surroundings on the roadway (more than I already was) ,and I will say I am more vigilant of the motorcycles and dirt bikes in my area especially since I live in an area with a lot of back roads."

2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad to hear your feeling better!

Saturdays (and sometimes Wednesdays :) ) aren't the same without you."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The king has returned! Honestly missed your videos especially these repair videos, but you have to balance it with carnage."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I like watching other people with similar car addictions, it always makes me feel better about my collection of old misfits. Hope to see more of this c4 in the near future"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I completely agree with you when you say you‚Äôd much rather have a collections of older, fun cars instead of something new and flashy. Could‚Äôve been me arguing that point:) Love the C4, it‚Äôs definitely on my radar too. Looking forward to seeing you address the issues. Greets from The Netherlands!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"i enjoy watching your junk collection grow, keeps me from going out and doing the same thing. Glad to see ur back man!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good to see you back, you sure that's just not a plug that was broken and then ejected the core out? How often does a head gasket blow and leak externally? Sounds just like a missing spark plug. 
And when you checked for spark, was that black decorative cover crap metal or plastic? Looked plastic and of course the test plug won't spark on the plastic. 
Good luck with this one, hope to see the rebuild in videos."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Happy to see you're feeling better! Someone else already said it, but Saturday really isn't the same without you. Reminds me how much I used to love working on cars when I was younger and less broken."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Welcome to the C4 Corvette family!!! Once you understand GM mentality, it's a great car! Very good performance even compared to newer cars. So much fun for the money!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"C4s are wonderful cars.  The 92-96 6spds have really good performance.  They are generally easy to work on, rock solid reliable and inexpensive to maintain.  If you're into modifying your cars... a great base to start from."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good to see you, glad you are back and doing well.  I'm going to enjoy this series of Corvette mayhem !   LOL"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"In this series, Eric renews his hate for repairing all variety of corvette. I did a harmonic balancer on a C6 a few months ago, what a massive pain that was...oh and Noco makes a mean jump box...the GB150 is a beast"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It would be a great to see you rebuild this, especially since you are in a unique position for parts and engineering contacts. All in all, if the frame is good and you can replace the broken plastics, then a blown head gasket and some heat damage is not a disaster and you'll end up with a low milage car in good condition you'll be able to enjoy, even if you end up just swapping out the engine."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I'm very happy to see you working on an LT1
I can't get enough of it."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I wholeheartedly share your love of 80's and 90's cars! and I'm very excited to watch you bring this wonderful example of a corvette back to life!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I had a 93, one of my 3 LT1 cars.  I miss that car and the opti wasn't great but was a bit over blown.  Currently, I have C5 Z06 in my little fleet, my second C5.  Looking forward to the videos.  I actually liked driving my 93 C4 6speed more than the C5 6 speeds but the C5s are much easier to work on, especially LT1 C4s."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I am HIGHLY surprised (but glad) it started with only replacing the ignition module and coil. My goto in this situation would always be the Opti ... Made life a tiny bit easier for you, so good on yah!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I have asked NONE of those questions, I just love seeing what you have up next.  I love that you are so busy with projects, and that you care enough to take us with you.  Keep doing your thing and I'll keep watching!  Thanks for the videos!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Can't wait to see what you do with it, Eric!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You are hilarious Eric, you always end up doing much more to get the car you purchase back to running condition, like with this yellow Carrera, but we all learn in the process, and this is where the fun lies üôÇ
You didn't have an engine teardown Saturday, I suppose you were busy wit this? üôÇ"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Welcome back, you seem much better now so let's wait for that dipstick battle to commence üëç"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Best of luck with the project! I've got a manual '95 in arctic white as well, though it's not as kitted out (or as low mileage) as your project. Lots of fun, but lots of work. Worth it, though! Looking forward to more videos!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"The minute it started, I heard the ""there's gonna be another video or 6"" noises. Hard to turn that engine over, too. Might be something from the crash wedged against a pulley or suchlike. (or a chunk of barrier cable wrapped around a pulley)  8^)"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Missed seeing a teardown video this past Saturday (12/3) but I gather you were under the weather ; glad you are feeling better.  That Vette is gonna be a good challenging build and I look forward to seeing it.  Nice to have oil pressure as well.  HB56
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I am super pumped for this series since I am working on my 93 40th anniversary convertible and need tips on engine stuff and would like to see what he has to do to rectify the issues.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Awesome channel üíØ just found and subbed a month ago! I get to binge watching at times. Thanks from Cape Cod  where vehicles rust soon fast lol! Stay safe and healthy and thanks for doing thisüëç
2,eRfNLGkohrw,excellent choice to add to your fleet sir! good to see you up and about and if it is too hard to find the parts or time to rebuild that LT-1 i‚Äôm sure you could easily find an LS platform to shoehorn into that engine bay? just an idea to ponder thanks for more education again be well
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I want one just like it, blown gaskets and all. I look forward to the series, or at least to the next project that takes precedence."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Well done on the buy!  I look forward to more videos on it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I'm both happy and sad that c4s are starting to make their rounds on YouTube across different channels. Happy because they're such cool under appreciated cars that are a great handling and performance bargain! I'm sad because of this attention, every Tim, Dick and Jerry will think that they have a special car and the prices are going to start climbing. Keep the c4 cheap!!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Hi, new sub to the channel.  Nice car, looks solid, good wheels & tires, 6-speed. I have a LT-1 T/A 6-speed, can't wait to see you dive into the engine.  These LT-1's are underrated, throw a cam and headers on it and delete the Opti-spark, go LS coils & mild port the heads, easy 350rwhp. Good luck :)"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Fun Corvette project and you got it at a great price. Can't wait for the continuing videos.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Darn, bad luck for you but this will be wonderful viewing for the novices like me. Great stuff as always!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice diagnosis!  Always loved the C4 - nice choice. üëç
2,eRfNLGkohrw,what a beautiful car. I'm excited to see more content on it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Awesome car. I look forward to seeing it rebuilt and back on the road.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"For what it's worth... I enjoy watching you tear down engines, whether they are good or bad, but this kind of videos entertain me much more. You get to follow along in the troubleshooting process and guess - ""I wonder what could cause that problem"", ""are we going to suspect the same thing"", ""how is he going to fix that"", ""wow, that was a neat trick"".
As someone who dreams of one day having the place and the financial security to restore a ""project car"", I really like these videos. If you keep 'em coming, I'll keep watching 'em."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Love C4's, glad you will be bringing It back to life."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"A new twist to the channel?  Not just a teardown, but a teardown and rebuild maybe?  Should be a fun car when finished.  Also, glad to hear that you are feeling better and hopefully the rest of the family is well by now also."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Love that you‚Äôre saving these 80s/90s cars.  All these other cookie-cutter automotive YouTubers who‚Äôll only touch carb/points cars because they are too chickenshit to touch fuel injection are getting very boring.  Keep ‚Äúdoing you‚Äù!!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I have had two c4s, an 85 and an 89 with the zf6, loved em both. Glad to see you back and healthy!!!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Haha, the whole ""If I had unlimited money I wouldn't buy a Lamborghini or Ferrari, I'd buy 80's and 90's cars"" thing definitely rings a bell! New cars just don't do it for me, I just LOVE the body and engine designs of that time period. So much amazing stuff that's so much more interesting."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You have the skills and tools. Go for it. With a mystery car, it's almost always worse than you first think. Par for the course"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Many people today sneer/laugh at the C4 but in reality it was a groundbreaking design and was unbeatable in ""stock"" SCCA classes, so much so they were banned from competition and ended up with their own class in 1988.  They are arguably the best bang for the buck racer you can buy today.  It doesn't take much to make them very capable in today's events.  As a young man in 1984 I really wanted one but I was more into drag racing and sport bikes.   Eric, I hope you spend the time and money to bring this one back to perfection, it is a worthy project."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice to see your running on all cylinders
2,eRfNLGkohrw,EXCELLENT  4 weeks ago I just bought a '96 LT4 (Manual) in great condition and now I get to watch you work on your C4 as I work on my C4!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You know I just finished watching legit street cars, finish up an auction C4 with a blower on it. Glad to see people enjoying the LT1 engine."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You made an interesting comment about doing these tear downs alone.  Maybe you could invite a fan to be there when you do the work.  Not that they have to be in the video but to help you when needed.  Also, it would make for a good safety move.  If something were to happen, then there would be someone to assist.  Keep up the good work.  I enjoy each video you make"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"48k on a clean manual LT1 is worth 5k any day of the week. Dollar for dollar, you can't beat the fun. My Camaro just so happens to be running great thanks to the LT1 you sold me a while back. Thanks again!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Nice car looking forward to seeing more of this one
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Great find!  Sorry about the gaskets, I‚Äôm sure nothing else was damaged when it overheated, right?  What are bearings for again?"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,always difficult in these videos to know what these cars really sound like in person  but ithink this video got the sound through great.  hah
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"You're not alone. I just sold off a couple of things that I had high hopes for but getting to old and not enough time or money.  You keep on trucking Bro. Oh, how's the new bundle of joy coming along?"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Another great teardown video. Keep it going
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Enjoy your show, both the teardowns and cars/trucks stuff too. I turned my 1995 Corvette into a Track Day only car and pulled everything out to save weight and I mean everything. Sold most of the stuff but have complete working when removed HVAC system, the good one, the automatic climate control system and includes the entire heater/evap assembly removed from under the dash. Includes compressor, condenser, lines, blower motor and housing, etc. I live in Michigan though. If interested, let me know."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Could also use a volt meter with the max function. Crank it over and then check the meter.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Currently chasing all the gremlins on my 96.    Was in pieces when I got it 3 years ago for $1900 with 81k on it.  Now looks much better and runs great but be ready for fun stuff like pinched wires on the trans tunnel which took out the tps and fried the ecm (rebuilt for $225 and ran wires up top for the tps).  Best of luck, can't wait to pick up some tips."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I knew something sounded wrong when you were cranking it and in a way I was right about the compression -- I just didn't know it was a blown head gasket. I hope the heads aren't warped.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It's not that terrible, it'd be well worth doing it all when your in there. Will be a great car once completed"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"C4's with a manual trans are extremely fun cars to drive.  By the audio, it sounded like a plug was MIA, as in not screwed into the head anymore, and compression was escaping. So long as the frame isn't tweeked, ur in good shape. My only issues with the C4 and up are the fact that they are glued together in some places, making bodywork a real chore.. Good luck!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Yup, I heard it when you were finally able to get it turning over and said there was a huge issue. There was a cylinder that didn‚Äôt have much compression. When it finally started and saw the smoke (steam) coming from the engine I said blown head gasket. Fortunately it wasn‚Äôt a fire that was causing the smoke. 

Aside from the obvious front end repairs needed it certainly does appear to be a Vette in very good condition and yes, a really nice white interior. So I can‚Äôt blame you for wanting the car. In the some 45 years being in the automotive industry I never had the opportunity to own a Vette. I‚Äôm sure once you have the repairs done you will enjoy that car immensely! Congratulations and good luck with your acquired C4.  üëè"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Great lunch break video.  Keep 'em coming, Eric!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Glad to see you back!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad to see you‚Äôre back, and with a new project car. I‚Äôm not a big fan of 70‚Äôs through 2000‚Äôs Corvettes, but it should be a nice ride when you get it done. With relatively low miles, it should be a decent investment. Looks like the Air bags and interior are still good, does that mean a clean title still?? Hopefully you and your family are doing well. Thanks for taking us along to enjoy your obsession or sickness, whatever it is."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"We missed you! However I'm glad to see you with a C4 Corvette. If you ever find a wrecked C4 Roadster, 86 to 89, I need a driver's door! The car rolled backwards into the garage with the driver's door open, folding the door forward. I have been looking for one for 3 years. I didn't think you looked for Corvettes, so I never requested one. I will put it on your list of cars to look for."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Would love to see more videos of your vette when you get time very cool üëå‚úåÔ∏è
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Sounds like a nice time to pull the motor and rip into it for repairs
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I had a white 1995 base Corvette LT1 6-speed for 8 years, it was a very nice driving car, great performance value, very reliable and zero issues with the opti. I hope you get this built soon and back on the road!  Very fun cars."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I bought my 1995 in 1997 from a Chevy dealer.  It was winter, and the price was $21k.  It had 22k miles and was still under warranty.  It had every option except TPMS and ZR1, including the Z07 Autocross suspension.  It has been a very reliable, fun car.  However, the Optispark has been the bane of my existence.  Nearly every aftermarket opti has the tone ring spaced incorrectly, where it scrapes the optical sensor.  This will make it have a very short life.  So you need to disassemble any new opti, check and correct the tone ring spacing, and then reassemble it before you can use it.  The only part that dies is the optical sensor.  It takes a ridiculous amount of labor to get the opti out, mostly because of the Corvette's layout.  The 2-piece balancer helps, but everything is squished in there.  The plug wires are the most fun - be sure to label them before removing them from the old opti."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I‚Äôd send it back to the auction with miles listed and make some loot. But then I saw you have a parts car! Gonna be a nice one.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Good stuff, looking forward to this build"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,i'm LQQKING forward to the build and drive on your new car !
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"There's nobody on YouTube more qualified to tear down an LT1.  Hopefully you can put it back together too.  As an 80s kid I love the C4 body style.  To me, that's what a Vette should look like.  Can't wait to see it drive!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"My son bought a 94 two years ago with 35K on it in like new condition However, because the car did nothing but sit for years, after upgrading the Opti-spark (installed the vacuum vent line) and driving it a couple hundred miles he came to my shop with a rod knock, sure enough pulled the pan and found one bad rod bearing (you could see the black moisture marks on the bearing surface) and the rest were fine so his LT1 is sitting at the engine builders as we speak, he will still come out on top, car is a British racing green with beige interior and the special deluxe seats (or whatever they are called he knows). These cars could pull a 1+ G on the skid pad. Love your videos, look forward to how yours comes out. Thanks."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Glad you found a ""good one"" and hope you get to enjoy it."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"while you're in there, drop the compression with thicker head gaskets and add a procharger"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,always just a little bit more work than you think lol. Ready for the journey!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,That loud noise sounds exactly like what a spark plug left out of the cylinder sounds like lol thats some serious leakage lol
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Please don't stop buying projects.  You're addiction for awesome car projects brings me happiness, therefore, it should bring you happiness too??  We love all your projects."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,Now this is a fix I want to watch ASAP Please !
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Just picked up a ‚Äò96 CE. Owned 2 previous C4‚Äôs for 16 years before this one. They are adult go karts. Easy to work on without too many electronics. If you need C4 parts, check out Mirrock Corvettes who specialize in C4‚Äôs. Enjoy your project C4 üá∫üá∏"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I get it.  I would love to have a rust-free (that's what killed ours) 85 or 86 Honda Prelude 5-speed manual like we had when I first got married. I really loved that car. Saw a navy one in the Barnes Parking lot on Forrest Park BLVD.  no rust... it looked primo and it gave me the warm fuzzies. I totally get it.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"After hearing it crank, compression check would be on the list. Check to see if it had coolant?"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,You're definitely different than a lot of car YouTubers. Most would already be dropping an ls motor in it but you seem to prefer your cars in stock format. I can appreciate that.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I love these late model c4s. Always wanted one.
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It's Christmas time and I've decided to sub, like, and such to channels I frequently watch.  I dig what you do and I hope the few pennies of ad revenue I'm providing helps you and the family out.  I still use an ad-blocker, but I digress... Merry Christmas!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,It's also got a skip. Usually means low or no compression in one or more cylinders. Didja do a compression test on er?
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Bummer about your findings, but it's likely easily repairable with such a low mileage engine assuming nothing warped or cracked. Merry Christmas!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,I'm so happy u feel better buddy üôÇ
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Ah yes, our old friend Project creep. I know him well. I'm re-gearing my Jeep and also redoing the interior of my house, so I know all to well, ""in for a penny, in for a pound."""
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Yea, tough break on it. Even with that nasty sounding crank, I‚Äôm surprised it ran! This one is gonna be a fun one to watch you build! Looking forward to it doing some nasty burnouts!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"Hey, I would have done the same thine. Especially for a 95 manual. Year I was born. C4 is the underrated gem of Corvettes"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"you are right my friend , the cars you are talking about are great and i feel like you. they are better then those fancy cars from european market."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"A friend of mine has the same condition you do. He owns his own shop, but he's still limited on space. He has a lot of projects, he still needs to finish and never misses the opportunity to take on another project."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"I understand your sickness.

I was getting bored so I gave my son a 2003 Tacoma Prerunner in really great shape and bought a 2003 4wd V8 4Runner to tinker with.  It's going to end up costing way too much for what it's worth but I want to get back into 4 wheeling again and this is one of the cheaper ways to do it.  

Happy wrenching!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,What a chore! As soon as I saw the busted radiator and heard that start up I assumed head gasket failure. Sucks but at least you have a donor!
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"well, if the injectors are pulsing (you can smell fuel) I'd start by trying a different ICM."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"IDC: Crap this is going to take a while and I'll have to tear things down.
All of us: YES! Content!"
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"As a former Mystic Cobra owner, I feel your pain with regards to paint."
2,eRfNLGkohrw,"It had been so long since your last video, I was beginning to worry about your health.

2,eRfNLGkohrw,You have to ground the plug to see a spark. Your plug is resting on a plastic bit.

2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Well done on getting to 40k subscribers shows you got the right sort of content . Buy at the right price and trade some out if you can to keep the best sales stock  üëçüëç
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Keep buying the right ones, it's where the money is made.  Cherry pick the best for retail and trade on the rest.  Pretty much what you already do."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"I feel like you need to concentrate on prepping one or two cars at a time. It's so easy to get distracted and do a bit here and there but nothing in particular gets finished. The way I did it was spend my days prepping my oldest piece of stock and my newest piece of stock at the same time, that way you're keeping newer stuff turning over and shortening your stock holding timescales. The mirca and possibly the up being your oldest units which could be prepped for sale with that clean skoda and the disco as they need minimal prep and wont take as long to do."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"These shorter daily videos make for great viewing and are often easier to fit into the daily routine than the longer ones.
 I don't think you need any advice as you obviously know what you are doing and have created a very successful business in a tough market. Well done on hitting 40K subscribers!"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Just noticed the bumper is dented on the Freelander (passenger side foglamp area) - heatgun and a good pull should straighten it out.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"I feel like you need to employ someone to help you out, you'll get more cars sorted and more profit!"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Congrats on the 40K subscribers!  Been watching since your days at Alfa Ragazzi - you've come a long way in a short space of time üëç

That 155 sounds like a job for Neil at Italia Autos üòÄ"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Great purchase the Kia, nice reliable, simple engineering and under ¬£3k must be the ideal stock for the uncertain times we live in now. 
Incredible that you can sell that for under half the price of the engine repair on the Discovery. 
Absolutely shocking that a 7 year old vehicle with average mileage needed a full engine rebuild. Speaks volumes for the build and material quality of them. Paid for under LR warranty too, so that's added to the price of it when it's new to factor in the terrible reliability. 
When will people get wise and stop paying exorbitant new prices for these pieces of junk?"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Buying cars at the right money is in theory always the right thing to do. The smart move is making your time work properly. So if you‚Äôre trading out cars like the Alfa and Citroen - don‚Äôt bother washing up, let that be up to the next trader. Focus on what needs to be advertised first, even a whiteboard inside might help prioritise."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Keep buying the right stuff Great content üëå
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,well done james you have hit 40k subs well deserved
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I think you should focus more on the small cheap to run cars which you seem to shift quickly.  Love the Fiat but the classic car market is a bit dead now but looking forward to seeing what you do with it. Love your videos and always look forward to the next one üëçüèª
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I think you could benefit from an employee‚Ä¶even if just part time‚Ä¶to help you prep and turn the cars over quicker
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Have as many cars as you can store James, but with this many, I feel as though it's becoming a bit overwhelming, and you don't know which way to turn or what to prep next, there's that many of them. Time to consider employing a 'spotty yoof' to get them at least reasonably presentable, ...with your expert guidance and teaching  of course....so you can get them advertised and sold. Your channel is a damned good advertising tool anyway. Keep up the grafting me owld mucker. We LUVS you!"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Like someone has said, ideally you need a prep guy to get motors clean, bodywork done & ready. Then you can focus on the sales, enquires and updating the adverts/pics."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"The XF seems cheap despite her issues....
Was looking forward to seeing even more of her :("
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I'm still very tempted to buy the Rio. I'd really like a 1.6 Sport though because they're so rare!
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Congratulations on hitting 40k subscribers James,if you can get cars at a good price and make a profit then carry on as you have the room but you do make Me shout at the tvüòÜso yesterday your video was the fiat and that is going to take an awful lot of time up but then your saying you need to trade alot of your stuff because you don't have he time so your giving mixed messages but then it's your life,channel and business but I just wanted to say it as I won't be the only one thinking itüôàü§£üëç"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Fantastic that you reached 40k subscribers before Christmas. Love your work. I like the more frequent shorter videos. Means that I get a more regular Chops fix.  I think your quiet December is out of the window now. All the best
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Enjoy watching your videos ,good to see what goes on ,keep up the good work"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Like in the JAWS film, "" You're gonna need a bigger trading space"" lol, Great video"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Very sad the Alfa came to this but hope above all hopes that she gets sorted and gives many more smiles:- because she's worth it!! From Trevor the Alfa man (I'll stop going on at you now üòÅ)
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"they might be a bit harder to get but id stick with the smaller cars,you never seem to have any issues moving them on very quickly,,
more room to park them indoors too,thankyou for the update James,,üëåüëç"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"The 155 will sit under a cover for the next 5 years.
The owner will never get the work done.
At some point you will try and contact them to get it collected and they will'ghost' you.
Tell them to pick it up now and free the space up for working stock.
PS. Don't offer to 'rent' then a space for storage. After the first month's payment they'll never pay again!"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"I think you know exactly what you're doing mate. You dint seem like your a gambler I think you've always got a plan a b c and d. 

Would love that alpha and jag.

Great content as always"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,As long as your making a bit of cash and your happy that‚Äôs the main thing‚Ä¶. Always a good watch the ramblings !
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Could you do a video on how you got started as a car dealer and how much you initially started with to buy your first Stock?
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,You‚Äôve made it to 40k üôå well done and well deserved congratulations üëèüòé
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"James where is the young lad that helped you before? Love all the content that you put out, it‚Äôs great to see you are doing well. Living way up north now I only follow 1 other person, and that‚Äôs your mate in Scotland."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"I don‚Äôt think you should ever turn down good deals‚Ä¶ just as long as there‚Äôs profit being made and your not getting snowed under! 
Can we see the Ignis sport getting thrashed about a bit (lot) !! lol üòÇ"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"You're a car dealer, you can't sell cars if you don't have cars. You also can't sell cars if they're not prepped and advertised . Maybe some help cleaning   them ? 
You've done really well and deserve any success you have . 
Peace and love brother ‚úåÔ∏è üëç‚ù§Ô∏è"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,If I lived closer would be happy to do 2 or 3 days a week prepping cars for you. Yes you probably have too many cars but your a car guy I would be just the same üòÇ the disco looks greatüëç
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,My ignis never let me down and only sold it as the ride was a bit firm.i was told the sports version is a lot firmer
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"The clues in your occupation name.... Car Dealer.üòÇ While it doesn't hurt and it's viable, buy 'em! I enjoy your sharing. Thank you."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Think u need to sort out the stock that‚Äôs been hanging around for ages. Let‚Äôs get that Micra sorted or sold. Up needs finishing.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Keep buying when geting the right price nice cars :)
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"keep the alfa and sort it out eventually, i think youll regret getting rid of that one"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"still loving the channel james :-) perhaps concentrate on your current stock for now? like that vw up!  which would sell easily, once done."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,As much as you'd like to You can't keep every car If you make a few quid on every motor without doing anything to them through the trade It's all good
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,You definitely need a good labourer to help out with day to day work
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I‚Äôd rather spend the extra cash knowing the car I‚Äôve bought is being prepped properly!
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"That land rover looks very nice , something im looking for ."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Really like the look of that Discovery and it‚Äôs ULEZ compliant. ü§î
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,You definitely need help to get things done
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I genuinely can‚Äôt understand the difference in prices for second hand cars around the country! That 06 rav 4 would be in the breakers up our way if the engine had gone. Sometimes you‚Äôve got to walk away and cut your losses
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Got the Topdon JS2000 using the code from this channel - great unit, very helpful"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,For me you either need to manage your work load better or hire someone to clean the cars even if it‚Äôs a youngen part time
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,You need to get somebody to help you to get cars up for sale even somebody part time
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"If the cars are right I don't blame you buying them, but I feel you need some help with prep and organising,  scotty was a good help, and the young girl used to help ( sorry forgot her name) . Apart from that, keep up the good work üëç"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I think you should keep buying stuff that makes sense but cars like the Rio theres not enough skin on the bone for the potential come back if something does go wrong in the 6mons
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Meh, you are having a time and making money, so just carry on. Pretty sweet, contract out the oily stuff to trusted agents, no long hours with bleeding knuckles, sounds good.üëå"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"James you can take that personal plate off the Alpha instantly on the DVLA website and it wiil allocate its original number,done it many times new V5 normally arrives within 5 days, congrats on the 40K"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"A mate of mine always had one his cars at mine until I got fed up, took it back and walked home."
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Keep the good work and don't stop you are enjoying it that's what matters. If I was nearer to you would come down give you a hand with car cleaning.

2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Think you need to start having a clear out James. December ain't a busy sales month unless it's something special. 
Like the black Mercedes soft top. Wrong time of year for folk to be interested though with rear wheel drive and an open top,"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Congrats on the 40k! :)
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,If the funds are in the account and the cars come available. Its a no brainer james.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Carry on buying cars at the right price but look to expand and get some more help.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,I had a jag Xf 3.0 61 plate had nothing but problems from day 1 it went to engine malfunction and Limo mode it needed both egr valves replaced and trace a loose wire quoted ¬£2.5k so get it prepped and out the door and don‚Äôt look back lol

2,5_PvMqSSKgc,just carry on mate your doing fine
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Must admit I will not buy a car unless it has a minimum 9 months MOT I try to find cars that will be motd before I collect or 12 months been a long time since I've dropped on 1 with near enough 13 months.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Blimey, starting to look like ""Chops Car Park"""
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,40k hit   congrats my mate  have a nice xmas
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"You seems a little bit stressed James.  Take care of the old ticker. I should start to make ONE car a day, prep and photo,  that would take some stress off. So 7 cars a week , not bad"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,That land rover is well traveled James it's a Dundee car
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"School holidays coming up get a keen, good young lad or lass in to help prep the cars for sale, find the right one could be the best investment you'll ever make in your business üëç"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Well done on over 40k subscribers
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Not buying too many cars but not got enough help to get the most profit out of them. I do wonder how your bank balance/bank charges are looking.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"If you can't prep them you can't sell them, so it doesn't matter if you're buying them at a good price. Maybe it's time to get someone in to help out, but that opens up another can of worms!"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Proud to be one of the almost 40k and growingüëç
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Congratulations on the 40,000 subscribers üëç"

2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Well it says you have hit 40K on subscribers... One more tick done already
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,You need someone else in your company even if it‚Äôs only part time for paperwork
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Small cars in high demand at the moment. Get the smaller ones done and out the door.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Keep grabbing cars were you can mate although I think you need another member of staff to help
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Trying to sell an Alfa Romeo after telling your viewers that the arse rots out of them isn't particularly good for business James...
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,"Remember that time you said you could ""make a profit out of anything"". What are you worried about then?"
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,Keep buying cars but employ someone to clean and prep the others.
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,get them traded on asap James because you can't stop buying lol
2,5_PvMqSSKgc,40K done! Who's the world's best juggler? James! üòÅüëç

2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"Your videos are awesome, and super chill. Top notch videography üíØ you're inspirational to us and our detailing business. Thank you!"
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"This video is on another level of creativity. The detailing part was secondary, the filmmaking took the scene. 

What a nice surprise seeing you use Vonixx products, that's what we use the most on our day to day here in Brasil."
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,That vintage style segment was üî•üî•üî•üî•. Doing an entire video like that would be dope with the 90s BMWs. Maybe a short
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,Probably one of my favorite channels to see a new Upload. Absolutely love the content and cars!
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,Another amazing video! You are my favorite channel to watch. I know how much work it takes to create content like this and am inspired by your dedication and creativity. Thank you for taking the time to create such thoughtful work! The car turned out great!

2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"Great video of an iconic BMW! One of my favorite models & year, in an absolute stellar color. Can‚Äôt wait to see the finished product. This car is going to look amazing! Lee up the great work. Looking forward to the next one! Swony"
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"As usual fantastic video, It's like therapy for car people!  Question... did you cover anything up to prevent water from impacting any of the sensors, electrical, etc?"
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,My guy. The video is awesome! One of the better E36 M3‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen and no one else better to detail it! Looking good brotha. Also the merch is üî•üî•üî• definitely making a purchase after sending this comment!!

2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"When I think of videos that push me to work on my content creation to be the  best I can be, I think of this video.  Not as competition, just inspiration from this viewing experience.  I admit I feel bad, as I have only recently started following your channel, and it has been such a joy to watch."
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"As always, spectacular work!!  Very much looking forward to the finished product with new tires."
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,Yet another piece of art by the man himself. Mr. Chromatic!
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"The little merch section on the CRT TV blew me away.. I would gladly watch a longer video done in that style. The cars fit the vibe so well, like you're in a 90s BMW racing team's workshop"
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,Always a good day when there‚Äôs a new Chromatic video!
2,QN2HGLN9eJ8,"The camcorder roll was spot on, perfect idea! And when it comes to the M3, what I can say Brother - simply perfect!"

2,qyia0GirO2A,Rob the type of guy to store a 2018 car for 6 years
2,qyia0GirO2A,Today Mr. Spaghetti finds an old Italian meatball in the back of the fridge and puts it on the daily specials menu.
2,qyia0GirO2A,I‚Äôm so happy for you as far as the paved road. You‚Äôve been needing that forever. Congrats!!! Happy for you
2,qyia0GirO2A,Those are aftermarket wheels. The optional factory wheels are not carbon fiber and a totally different (split 5 spoke) design.
2,qyia0GirO2A,I seriously would have paid $20 bucks.  My offer stands.
2,qyia0GirO2A,Glad they finally paved that street. I know you happy about it for sure.
2,qyia0GirO2A,The 4C is a sick little car. I bet it would be a blast on a track.
2,qyia0GirO2A,I remember back when this car come in. Thought it was going to be sold but I kept seeing it in the background. Glad to see it come full circle.
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Funnest car I ever drove.   Its amazing in the mountains.    Nothing has this much feedback  and driving experience.   Drive for yourself and you will be a believer.    However u can grab one for far less than 70K.  ITS not made for the streets.   Highway and mountain twisties only.   Weekend car.  Roller coaster fun, mods take this thing to the next level, turbo sound and will have you smiling ear to ear."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Not going to lie, when he said I've got something to show you, I've been waiting years for this....I was expecting the evo to be finished. Silly me"
2,qyia0GirO2A,"The pave reveal deserved its own video lol, finally...."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Couldn‚Äôt have had it for 7-8 years if it‚Äôs a 2018 lol! They probably didn‚Äôt call 3-4 years ago it was probably 2 years ago, because once they stopped calling you held onto it for another year and applied for the title. Good for you though, you put up the capital to take care of it and deserve the car for the process of keeping it safe and trying to do the right thing"
2,qyia0GirO2A,One of my favourite cars in the garage <3
2,qyia0GirO2A,"I say keep it,it's a nice lil car and wouldn't be anywhere near as much to fix the little things as a Ferrari would cost."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"When you said you were going to do a big reveal I thought you were going to open the door and have something like a Ferrari F40, but a new road is good I guess.  LOL 
Just had my subdivision roads redone a couple months ago, wasn't too bad, ended up costing about $2000 a household. New roads are nice."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Yes keep it & if you paint it in Competizone red coat 
that'd be nutastic and maybe some F.carbon ."
2,qyia0GirO2A,Good luck selling the alfa 4c  for 65 grand. Im sure you will get that in this market. Glad ti see the alfa go and glad you got rid of the green wrap or dip. It was horrible . Glad the road git paved so people can drive in and out. Look forward ti your spring car show.
2,qyia0GirO2A,Somehow Rob had a 4 year old car stored in his shop for 6 years‚Ä¶ interesting?
2,qyia0GirO2A,Congrats on the repaving! Id throw a party
2,qyia0GirO2A,"""I've had this car, idk, 6 or 7 years""
(A moment later)
""What year is it, it's a 2018""
Hmmmmm?
Btw, it's a flooded car too"
2,qyia0GirO2A,The road looks great. Long time coming
2,qyia0GirO2A,"""You're not a REAL petrolhead unless you owned an Alpha.""
         -Jeremy Clarkson (Top Gear)"
2,qyia0GirO2A,I‚Äôd probably rent one if I could. I don‚Äôt see why this shouldn‚Äôt move as a $350 a day rental
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Gotta hand it to NJ local municipalities. All it takes for them to repave a road after a high visibility guy complains frequently, and at length, is about 5 years.

Next time ask them for something hard. üòÜ"
2,qyia0GirO2A,Was it also flooded when everything else flooded in the warehouse?
2,qyia0GirO2A,Ive always wanted one of these üòç
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Its a cute little car just like a miata, unfortunately its well beyond even new miata prices. Not quite as cool as the 8c, but still within the realm of turning heads with a unique car."
2,qyia0GirO2A,Well done for the surgery and for the car! Great both of them! But Alfa Romeo 4c is more beautiful than you üòÇ
2,qyia0GirO2A,I owned one of these but i Spider form so fucking fun such a unique driving experience you can't get anywhere else for the price
2,qyia0GirO2A,Rob i have a 4c and love it. Its alot of car for the money. The model you have is very nice. @@John4C
2,qyia0GirO2A,I'm surprised you've  never looked into fast Audis as a bread and bitter tool in the car hire business. They hire well in the UK.Happy Christmas  Rob.
2,qyia0GirO2A,Finally a Paved Road!! Congratulations!!!!
2,qyia0GirO2A,"2018 model, stored 6-7 years."
2,qyia0GirO2A,Also because of your paved road my driver had to turn around because he wasn‚Äôt able to make a pickup from a neighbor of yours because of the road construction haha
2,qyia0GirO2A,Cant believe Rob actually came out on top for once
2,qyia0GirO2A,I want one of those so bad!!!
2,qyia0GirO2A,if you really really dont like it I'll swap my Alfa MiTo for it :D definitely a fair deal right? XD
2,qyia0GirO2A,"If you fit in it, definitely keep it! It's an analog experience you will not get in any other car."
2,qyia0GirO2A,This car is sick my dude
2,qyia0GirO2A,That white paint is GORGEOUS ü§§
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Green ... now it looks nice, I don¬¥t know the reason why someone whant to ruin a cool factory painjob ..."
2,qyia0GirO2A,I think so many people were interested because they thought you would sell it for cheap.
2,qyia0GirO2A,New Street! Also did you move forward with your luggage company?
2,qyia0GirO2A,Lol so we just gonna forget that 1 year ago it was 1 foot under water‚Ä¶.
2,qyia0GirO2A,Dude the road has to be a whole episode
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Give me the car Rob, I am too old to buy a nice car. Remember this car well, its beautiful ."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Rob, hair and road look great!"
2,qyia0GirO2A,You should try renting it and see how it do
2,qyia0GirO2A,Stored it for 6/7 years. It‚Äôs 4 years old üòÇ
2,qyia0GirO2A,Mr spaghetti finally calls tony soprano and the paving union to get the street pavedüëç
2,qyia0GirO2A,"What a weird story, the dude went on one of your adventure drives and filed for bankruptcy right? Why did he leave it with you to begin with?"
2,qyia0GirO2A,That‚Äôs a beautiful machine‚Ä¶. Curvy
2,qyia0GirO2A,KEEP IT
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Hey I‚Äôll pay the $65, because that‚Äôs about how much I got in the bank right now and I‚Äôll also give you my 2007 Suzuki forenza wagon for it üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
2,qyia0GirO2A,Sell it to Matt Farah!! Heard he loves them!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ Xx
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Whats the mileage? Looks like retail and wholesale are pretty close on this one, no? Might just wanna run it through Manheim."
2,qyia0GirO2A,How have you been storing a 4 year old car for 6 years lol
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Problems getting resolved for you before the end of the year, may 2023 be headache free and prosperous."
2,qyia0GirO2A,Best color spec on the 4C
2,qyia0GirO2A,"2:20 ""ive stored this car here for 6 or 7 years"". 2:53 ""it is a 2018 Alfa 4C""   Keeps hair treatment screwed with your Arithmetic Rob?"
2,qyia0GirO2A,How can you store a car 6 or 7 years when it is only 4 years old?
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Bro there value is going to skyrocket mid next year, don‚Äôt tell anyone I told you."
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Today Mr. Spaghetti shows another meet ball, from the motherlandüáÆüáπ"
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Yeah you should 

You could be blasting past American cars at both the traffic lights and the fuel stations"
2,qyia0GirO2A,That's the worst pave job I've ever seen. Two winters max.
2,qyia0GirO2A,Put it on Cars & Bids!
2,qyia0GirO2A,Beautiful car
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Looks so much better in white. I would buy it for 45K, but not 70."
2,qyia0GirO2A,4c you make back some of the money you lost over the years
2,qyia0GirO2A,"""I've been storing it for 6 or 7 years

..... car is 4 years old. The math isn't mathing here."

2,qyia0GirO2A,Do you have more hair I‚Äôve seen some other videos where it seems like it‚Äôs worse hopefully it gets better
2,qyia0GirO2A,"The market is cooking down so if you want to sell it I‚Äôd do it now, but I wouldn‚Äôt drive it much with you access and collection so it‚Äôs not worth keeping."
2,qyia0GirO2A,Rob I need a car. Sell it to me for 15k
2,qyia0GirO2A,Sell it and build your supra
2,qyia0GirO2A,"Hold up 40k 60k.. dude, it was flooded I remember too lmao. No way can it bring that much. And its oddball history. I mean in todays world anything goes i suppose. Id give 20k for it and it better not hydrolock on start up or something. But yeah, damn. Or keep it as a rental. Not a bad money bringer. Im sure people that dont have much would be interested. Say 1 or 200 a day"
2,qyia0GirO2A,theres been acouple that have been on FB marketplace here in socal for low 50s high 40s
2,qyia0GirO2A,Atleast track ot before you sell it
2,qyia0GirO2A,Sell it and call it a day.
2,qyia0GirO2A,That‚Äôs cool.  I‚Äôd go to a car show.
2,qyia0GirO2A,"soo 6/7 years

2,qyia0GirO2A,Rob has stored a 4yr old car for 6 or 7 years lmao
2,qyia0GirO2A,"The hair looks great!

2,-MAmqdDycK8,"brings me a smile looking at duos friendship, those hugs were sincere from TJ"
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"The widebody C8 is kind of a sad case because it‚Äôs definitely the best looking kit imo, and it felt like it took inspiration from the 458, and hurrican. Really hope the m4 lives up to the hype."
2,-MAmqdDycK8,Just ordered a license plate cover and a jet tag!!! Absolutely loving all the videos of vlogmas! Love you Teej!! ü´∂üèº
2,-MAmqdDycK8,I feel like I‚Äôd go into WCE and he‚Äôd somehow convince me to finance a car that I don‚Äôt even have a fraction of the money to pay for üòÇ

2,-MAmqdDycK8,Calvin coming back with a BANG! üòÜ harassing Tj on his own channel and have him agree is the most humble thing! Keep up the great work Tj! Always a awesome time !
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"TEEJ, I love your personality and it‚Äôs the reason I watch your channel im honestly not a fan of all the jdm cars but I love the Europeans and I feel like you are missing a supercar in the collection in the form of that 765 or either gt3rs"
2,-MAmqdDycK8,‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come back here till your c8‚Äôs are sold‚Äù Hunter is the best.
2,-MAmqdDycK8,Calvin back is what vlogmas needed.
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"On the ninth day of vlogmas TJ gave to me: a BRG M4 delivery, an intake from Eventuri, an exhaust to make the M4 scream, some pickle ball games with big T, an oversized Christmas tree, another exhaust that sounds gnarly, selling parts to keep the shop clean, a cease and desist from harley and calvin's back to join the party!"
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"Im 100% with my boy Calvin, i wanna have a good looking car that everytime i look at it it makes me happy"
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"Hell yea TJ, glad your getting rid of the other C8. I was just waiting for that to happen I knew you were smart enough to realize you and Sabrina definitely don‚Äôt need it üòÇ love ya man see you tomorrow"

2,-MAmqdDycK8,Damn poor Calvin. My lungs got absolutely rekt when I had covid. Glad to see he's back!
2,-MAmqdDycK8,Would be next level shit to do a GT3 RS Street Hunter catalog!
2,-MAmqdDycK8,I love Calvin so much. I have missed him and I was worried you guys weren't friends anymore. Or Calvin was mad. I'm so happy he's back ‚ò∫Ô∏è
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"718 Spyder is the choice Teej. Picture your 3RS, now remove the roof (and it‚Äôs weight) and remove the PDK (and it‚Äôs weight) for the GT 6 speed. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a more suitable place for it than where you live either. You can even get a brand new one and still save (and quickly make) $100k versus the 3RS or manual GT3. The 4RS/Spyder RS fenders will be readily available soon so you can spice it up. All of the other GT parts are already out there and the 8k vs 9k rev limit may just be a coding nerf ü§´."
2,-MAmqdDycK8,The Calvin/TJ bromance is a true feel good Xmas holiday story! Haha.
2,-MAmqdDycK8,"I always come through casually during the year, I have a dad car now and am lame. But vlogmas always hits!"

2,-MAmqdDycK8,I don‚Äôt think I would base my car reliability info off of chois cars üòÇ
2,-MAmqdDycK8,The c8 for Sabrina was a necessary evil. She needed that car to get her used to performance driving. I‚Äôm curious what she‚Äôs gonna get next. Maybe she gets a gt3 ahahaha
2,-MAmqdDycK8,looking at the current stock TJ would go with a Mercedes AMG GT Black series
2,-MAmqdDycK8,I love seeing C8‚Äôs get sold.

2,-MAmqdDycK8,"Love the videos, but wish the Corvettes got more action. Buy, build, sell every time with them.  Some driving videos with your friends out having fun (DDE style) would be a good change of pace and something different."
2,-MAmqdDycK8,T Goose hittin the TINA on the blooper I see you bro!  Honestly the UV Purp 991 would dope but I personally would love to see a baja runner build especially for your desert trips that would be sick!! Also what about the the vison boards my guy?

2,-MAmqdDycK8,"Love the widebody C8, However mods don't increase the price of the vehicle. If anyone buys it will be because it was your car. It will be interesting to see if you get the price you want. Keep us updated."
2,-MAmqdDycK8,Sabrinas C8 really had some charma issues or something so I can see how she never got to get attached but anyone would be lucky to get it especially with all the Street Hunter on it but daammnn TJs TT C8 looked awesome. Good to see Pepper as well .

2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"This is the best regular car you can buy.  Period.  Fuel efficient, increased power, fantastic looks, practical sportback design, impeccable reliability and attainable for all.  An absolute home run."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Wow, this car looks stunning!  I may have to consider this as an option for the next car!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Love the sleek styling of this new Prius. Looks amazing inside out. Great job for the styling Toyota.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,The only downside having owned a Prius in past...it that its just too low to the ground!...otherwise great vehicle and awesome technology.  I moved up to a Rav4 hybrid which gets about 45mpg city/why and its a lot more fun than a Prius to drive for me and I can actually see traffic ahead of me and around me a lot better.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"If pricing remains reasonable and the AWD stays efficient, this will be a knockout. They nailed it and, honestly, I think I‚Äôll be choosing this over the M3, EV6, or ID4 I was looking at. This will be reliable, practical, and I can do the majority of repairs myself.

I‚Äôll predict 38K-40K for the AWD top trim."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Wow, what a beautiful machine! After the last iteration, I was concerned the design team at Toyota was losing touch with reality. This is the best-looking car Toyota has designed in many years!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"5:34 my wife drives 2010 Civic EX-L. Agree, this Prius looks like the spiritual successor to her car inside and out. Glad you mentioned it."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Great review of a totally improved Prius!  I think the volume knob on the passenger side is a great idea.  Easy access for the passenger, driver still has steering wheel control."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Nice job you guys, as usual.  Can't wait until you drive it."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I'm really interested in knowing how the cabin noise is on the highway. I do not need it to be class leading but a little improvement from last model year would make me consider buying one.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Can't wait to see it person.  Hopefully the chip issue is behind  us and Toyota can start pumping these out.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Wow, a gorgeous Prius? Definitely would be on my list next time I'm car shopping."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,This car looks like a banger on all fronts...looking forward to Wednesday!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"A fantastic review once again, you two are the best in the business imo. Looking forward to more info on the 14th though disappointed to learn my height might be an issue.  Thanks for addressing that!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,You couldn‚Äôt have paid me to drive the previous model.   This version is great looking!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I love the body lines especially on the side of the car. I hope that it's offered in Blue exterior and Black interior on every trim plus 42inches legroom.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"The new Prius looks great.
What's funny is the new Prius headlights/turn signals look very similar to the Ferrari SF90's but they cost a lot less."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Wow! This is definitely going to be on my list.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Great styling! Do you know if the Prime will get heat pump for us in canada? I'm already on a waiting list for an Xse. Thanks for all your great reviews!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"In Ontario, at this time,  the top Prius 2022 model including Freight and Delivery 
is about $36,350 CAN .
This will definitely be a hit for Toyota if they can keep the price lower than $39,000 CAN
for the new 2023 model  !"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"If the price remains close to 2022, this is a gonna be a smash hit! Can't wait!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Minimalistic dash/interior - I love it!  And the increased power makes this very attractive to me.  Sorry, no EV for this guy."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Would definitely need clear film paint protection for that hood with that slant to protect against stone chips.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,This looks like a winner for Toyota.  Love the front end.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,most lovable couple of the auto industry..most awaited video for me this year
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I predict the pricing will be super close to 2022, something in the range of $300-500 more, thus being a stunning good value."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I predict minimum 10% price hike over the outgoing model. We'll find out on December 14th. Looking forward to your next video on this.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I would definitely get this over the Tesla model 3
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I would expect a 5 to 10% price increase over the 2022. Clearly this a big step up from the current model.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I would expect a price hike over the outgoing model. Toyota now has the Corolla hybrid in a wide variety of models as more of an entry-level hybrid, which will allow them to price the Prius as more of a premium hybrid."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I think the price will remain the same.  I wish it had a real sunroof that opens.  Beautiful car.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Andrea is so cute lowering that passenger seat!! Gave me chuckles!! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

AWD, 6 sec to 60, 57 MPG, fully loaded, $45k!!! This will be a very sexy sweet beast!!! Bring it.  Finally toyota is talking car language.  This really should have been the last gen Prius Toyota is replacing. But better late than never.  Prius is no more butt of the joke!!! üòä"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"The major reason for the abrupt change in Prius powerplant output from 4G to 5G is that Toyota realized people KNOW they're NOT SAVING MONEY (you won't recuperate the premium on the purchase price by the fuel cost savings for quite a few years) by buying a Prius, but getting a MORE BALANCED VEHICLE.

This being able to save some major fuel and CO2 amounts while getting a ""fun to drive"" car, even with the transmission choices used for Hybrids."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Very nice vehicle! Dashboard is ok but better than first generation! Good show Andrea! üëçüèªüëçüèª
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Love the new design on the outside. The inside looks great too but that quasi-HUD is just weird. It feels naked or bald when I look at it. I'd prefer the traditional display over this one.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Definitely buying this as the Prime XLE! Will fit nicely with my Bolt EUV.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,The best looking Prius ever!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"As soon as i heard about the new prius, i cancelled 23 corolla hybrid preorder that i made last September. The new prius is definitely sexier, more powerful, longer range(for prime), but the same fuel efficiency. But now im afraid of the price‚Ä¶ its too good to be prius. i hope the top trim is not over 3.8k"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Toyota, job well done. Personally I would like a AWD in Canada snow for an extra 1"" higher ground clearance the least."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,So funny he mentioned the interior is  reminiscent of the 2006 Honda Civic. I thought same thing and I just sold our last spring after 16 years and 210k miles- it‚Äôs was a great car!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I miss the old 1,8 litre engine. It was fast enough. Cheap Insurance. Good fuel economy"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Finally Toyota finally !!!  A good looking Prius !!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I hope it's not too much more than the last one - I'd guess 36,995 for the top model in Canada."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Great review as always. Thanks for making it.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Fuel cutoff still automatically operates at 10 mph below the speed limit.  Hammer down.  üëç
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Yeah, I'm with Andrea, the look of the ""quasi heads up display"" is a bit of a hot mess."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"That dash board is simply revolting. 
That exterior is amazing!!
The interior designers destroyed the efforts of the exterior designers efforts. 
Wow."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Honda needs to knock it out of the park with the upcoming Civic Hybrid.  This new Prius is sharp.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I‚Äôve been waiting for info on the new Prius.  Thanks for getting out the info you are allowed to now.  I‚Äôm looking forward to your upcoming reviews.  Thanks for the work you both do.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"üá∫üá∏ the red color looks sporty.    More hp, torque,  more mpg.   I hope it's below 30k."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Hated the look of the old Prius but love this one!  It will sell, sell, sell!!!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I‚Äôd like to see companies offer tech packages on more trims I hate having to go to top trim for the bigger screen. I like the new Prius, great video guys! You‚Äôre my new favourite car review channel!"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Do you have information about the ground clearance? I‚Äôm curious to know if it is higher or lower than the current model
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,actually looks really good..can't believe we are not getting the new Prius in Australia.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,The prius really zaps into the 21st century with a super sci fi look we used to see in comics backs in the mid 20th century Andrea üò≥
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"It looks like the seat is hard to get in/out of, it's so low. And the HUD / display isn't shielded, so I would expect a major glare issue."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Yes. It does look that older civic cabin, we had a few of those and they were great."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,The Prius has gone from being one of the ugliest cars I've ever seen to one hell of a looker what a huge upgrade in looks!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Good Looking!!!   Kinda reminds me of what a Modern Celica would look like!!!!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Absolutely love it!ü§©ü§©
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Good job Toyota.  This is going to sell like hotcakes!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Looks amazing. Unfortunately Toyota is taking advantage of the market right now and blasting customers with minimum 8% interest, and rest assured you'll be waiting a year + to get it."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Definitely want AWD 57MPG and HATCH üëÄüëÄ
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,This is going to be a big seller. The price point will be much more attractive than a Tesla.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Good job mentioning not only driver height but torso length. I am only 5‚Äô10‚Äù but I am taller than my 6‚Äù friends when we are seated because I also have the torso of a giant lol which unfortunately makes it tough for me to get along with most Toyotas and their lack of headroom.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,In the late 80‚Äôs & early 90‚Äôs this is what magazine showed cars would be looking like in the 00‚Äôs. Maybe we‚Äôre 22 years late but glad Toyota(of all company‚Äôs) decided to take charge.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I wish reviewers talk about the display quality of the all the screens as well and not just the size of them... cause my mazda 3 display sucks in quality.

Finally,  guess Toyota or any other manufacturers doesn't mind reviewers with shaky cameras to showcase their products?"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Does the LE trim have keyless entry for the rear hatch? That's my #1 complaint for the 22 LE trim.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but I want a Prius. Too bad wifey wants an SUV so probably end up with a hybrid Rav-4. ü§∑üèº"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Top trim $44,500 cdn before credits, as it seems to be for many vehicles these days. Would make a very nice looking wagon eventually."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,The drag coefficient must be crazy low with that car. Big Car youtube channel has a video talking about the back story of the Prius. Actually a neat story.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Can't wait for you're driving impressions.
Btw, what Panasonic camera are you using for these videos?"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I am guessing the PHEV top trim will be around 45k Cdn before rebate, and this will be a very attractive price for a PHEV at this quality."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,That‚Äôs a good looking Prius I tell you what.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I guess it should start around 30k as anything up will overlap with Camry or rav4 as they start around 32, 34k"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Looks great.  I wonder if this new generation will continue to work well as a taxi cab or will the lower height be an impediment?
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Loved the pics. Looks flattened in person
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Gone are the days when cars are slow and underpowered, even this super economy car looks like it will be really fast."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I sure would like to know how a senior can get into it and climb out of it because it looks more like a sports car being so low?????? Once in you did look comfortable ü§îü§î
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"I think Toyota focus on performance to compete against BEV.  Against a Tesla model 3 or higher performance BEV, probably not.  But a Bolt, Leaf, ID4 or the like yes definitely."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Never would have bought the old Prius but this one I would if the price is good
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Judging by the comments it's going to be in short supply like the RAV4 Prime and will be marked up over an already higher price.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,My alarm is set for Dec 14!  Thanks Zack and Andrea!  üòä
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Looks great.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,This checks off all the boxes!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"No air vents in the back ü§î

Seems an odd choice for a vehicle popular with taxis and ride share."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Buying an XSE PHEV.  I'm guessing $35k USD for that.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,im gonna say the top trim will be 37-38k US
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Right now the 2023 Corolla Hybrid XSE AWD is 37,009CAD so my guess is that this one will be at least about $3000CAD more."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I love it!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,I can see it easily going over 40k cad
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,It looks so much better and not really like a hybrid which is great. Dont know the price yet but they will sell every one they make.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,predicting top hybrid trim to be CA $40k
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Honda used to style cars like this back in the day. One day, when that Prius is 10 or 15 year old, I'm gonna drop a Honda K20A2/transmission in it... then slap Civic Type R side stickers on it... along with Honda logos front and back... and tell people it was a 'Japan only' variant."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"This will 100% be a car of the year in North America in 2023. Such hybrids is the real future. 
Prediction on pricing is 34-40CAD."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,love it!!!!!
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,Longer and wider is always better.  Or‚Ä¶ so my Wife reminds me.  That being said‚Ä¶ I really like this new Prius.  What an impressive improvement!  Toyota definitely wasn‚Äôt sleeping during this latest evolution.  Well done them!  Thanks for the video.
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Is this a preproduction unit?  For the volume knob, it's a carry over from Japan (where the vehicles are right hand drive).  They really should have made a ""left hand"" version so the volume knob is on the left side for left hand drive vehicles."
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"Looks kinda llike a corolla hatch. Which i like. I love how slick, futuristic it is. Doesn't have that ugly prius look anymore. The interior wouldn't age well because looks like a spaceship. But it is definitely a statement of the generation. The 2020 vibe"
2,gh2dSy7bXAY,"The windshield seems to be excessively sloped.  Getting in and out would be a challenge, and the outward visibility must be like looking out through a slit."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I‚Äôve had 14 quads in my life but the blaster will always be one of my favorites. I had an 88 and 94. Great machine to learn mechanical chops on for a young teenager
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Great video Michael,   I abosolutely enjoy all the details you share on making decisions when doing these rebuilds. Some are risky but you express that and regardless of results, its information and results that makes your videos top notch.  I can't wait for your next video on this build, especially as I am working on my buddy 2002 Blaster.  Well done."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Imagine being one of Sabo's neighbors. Seeing him rip the streets on this tiny quad. üòÇ Lookin like Donkey Kong flyin around.  Actually a decent find. I need a Blaster now
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Awesome man! Love those old blasters they are so simple and a fun bike to ride, also heads up if u didn't know already banshee shocks fit perfect on the front an u can buy or make a bushing kit to run a 400ex rear shock, I did that to mine an it was a great improvement that didn't break the bank"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Hey man just wanna say thanks. Had a really bad day and didnt realize there was going to be a video tonight. Definetly brightened me up. Cant wait to see how this turns out. Keep up the great work
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I‚Äôm so excited that the blaster is finally getting the chance it deserves. The blaster is my favorite mid size quad of all time. The 2 stroke sound and the small and nimble body makes it one of the most fun quads of all time.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I have had two of them and they were Great little Quads. Both had Drum Brakes. The turning radius made it really fun to ride.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Can't wait for this build. It was my first race quad growing up!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Sweet buy, can't wait to watch it go through the rebuild process and to see where you take it"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Damn that brought me back to the good ole days I wanted to jump through the screen and take it for a ride that thing is in great shape for a blaster which everybody beat the hell out of when they owned one lol man this is going to be a great series Mike keep it up brotha
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Cannot wait to see the 240 build! I started racing with a white and red 06 blaster. Easy upgrade would be a stock banshee axle in the back. I always ran the Vito‚Äôs 240 kit with Vito‚Äôs head, vforce reeds, toomey pipe‚Ä¶ no issue smoking stock banshees. Can‚Äôt wait to see that build"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"I had a 2005 blaster with white plastics and i restored them using a sponge, water and soda, they ended up looking almost brand new!! Really love your videosü§ôü§ô"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Can‚Äôt wait for this project to be completed and can‚Äôt wait for the before and after
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Great bikes easy to work on. I built one for my son ported and polished, 4‚Äù over lone star swing arm, long travel a arms, works shocks, +2 steering stem, banshee brakes front and rear, lone star +4 axle and more. Great reliable bike fun to ride for even me. If you want to take it out riding before you tear it down pull the clutch cover off and adjust it first tho. Great purchase Mike you cant touch those in phx for under $2000 last time I checked"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Maybe I'm getting old, but I just seem to appreciate the more simple, basic have fun machines over high hp 15 grand machines. Thanks for reviving these smaller machines that we rode in my younger days."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Wow! this brings back memories. Had a 92 I think back in the day. It was so slow on sand but rode great üëç
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,one of the most unappreciated pocket rockets in the woods I've had them all and I always love the blast from the past üòÜ
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I had that same thing happen with the spark plug insulator on a set of Denso plugs in my Eclipse GST. I kept getting a misfire and when I would hold the plug up it would look normal with the gap but when  I held it with the electrode facing down the insulator would fall down and block the gap
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Nice video! thanks for adding a blaster on your builds. My first quad & a super fun bike looking forward this build.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I have the same FMF Fatty pipe and silencer on my 01 Blaster and it makes a great difference in power! Loving this series!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Another great one man. Loved watching you ride it and have a blast.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I‚Äôm stoked for this shootout mike ü§ôüèª gonna be rad af. But the blaster and 300ex will dominate all the 300ex is the best all around quad of the group but those blasters are so damn peppy.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Ahahhaa.. thank you Mike. I haven't laughed this hard since the early Maverick videos. Super excited to try out the ""re-ratio"" on the R next year."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,When I was a youngin we got a brand new at the time 06 blaster SE and it was a little ripper. Took that thing all over the dunes. If the YFZ's I have had didn't sell me on Yamaha these things definately did. Glad to see you bringing this back to life.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Bro I am stoked for this build. Had two of these growing up, last one I built as an MX quad. Dumped a good 4 grand in mods in that thing, had to get rid of it when I got my new YFZ450 years ago. I miss that thing... giving me the itch to build another one. Love the vids, best quad channel on here. Keep it up!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"I love blasters, parts are so cheap, so easy to work on and once you got em dialed in they are pretty reliable, good budget quad with decent power"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I absolutely love your channel and watching ur videos I had a 350 warrior growing up and my best friend had a blaster we used to rip around town in. Can‚Äôt wait to see what u do with the blaster!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"The one quad i owned was a blaster, 97 or 98 i forget. I prefered the blocky look  but it was a 'blast' to ride :P"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"I bet it has the same jank Chinese top end on it you got for it, I'd love to see you do a long rod big bore kit on it with some extended A arm's and axle,  with some good shocks,  I never see anyone do that to a blaster,  I've seen a few big bore builds but not a full mx style build,  I think you could really make the blaster a mean machine that handles great and has fun power."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Love can‚Äôt wait to see it built to the max!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Ive had my blaster for 24 years there definitely fun when you put some money into them!! I just did my 4th restoration on it üòéü§òü§òü§òü§òü§ò
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Love the blasters. They are so much fun. I just restored a 96 last year. Still have a few odds and ends to do to it. Watching this video is inspiring me to go out and finish up my resto project. Can't wait to see how it turns out and how it performs in the top quad series. I like your blaster video better then the rocky mountain video.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,For the color I'd do the red and white of the first year for the blaster. It's a classic looks and ypu already have the red frame and seat.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Blasters in my opinion are the best price to performance quads, cheap to work on, cheap to fix and it rips hard!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Man i just love your jokes, and that you keep the fails and wins in here like the compressor starting up.. your face was priceless, and i can relate so much when i do videos too. every time!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"If I remember correctly the blaster had a flange and bolts that help the pipe to the jug, I had to mod the flange on my DG pipe to use the stock bolts?ü§î She Sounds awesome, can't wait to see the Top Quad, and The Hi HP Build!!!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"I do believe 260 main jet is gunna be small because of the aftermarket exhaust, could be wrong but 260 is stock and I think the fmf pipe needs around 280-300 depending on if you have airbox lid on ect"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Man I loved those Polaris trailblazers but I was 10 when I was doing donuts climbing hills and backroad drifting on them so hard to say what it would be like at 30 dubble the size üòÇ
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Blaster was my first quad as a kid!! Then went to 450 yfz but man do I miss my blaster!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I prayed you would rebuild the engine! I‚Äôm so stoked!!!! Finally I can now rebuild mine once your videos out! Let‚Äôs gooooo!!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Hey Mike, another awesome video. I just wanted to mention that I noticed your body mic seems to be channeling audio more to the left side in the past few videos? Not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but your camera audio seems fine, so maybe its a mic setting. Just wanted to mention it just in case, could just be my imagination. Keep up the good work man!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"What a Yamaha collection!  beautiful bikes man!.  id say its defenitly a good buy, if you cannot find fenders in colors maybe you could make your custom graphics that would cover almost all of the front white."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,its pretty coooooo excited to see the 240 build! well im excited to see it all but definitely excited for that part lol
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,You got a great deal on that bike! By the sound of it there‚Äôs no reason to rebuild the top end.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I had a 2001 blaster with a 240 kit. I had so much fun on it
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Wouldn‚Äôt it been easier to drill out the jet hole?
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Grew up riding  my buddy's we both pretty much learned how to fix shit pretty much because of  it being a blaster had so much fun on that death trap  Hell another buddy hit a wire fence and about took him out on it  but there definitely a blast I want one thinking about it üòÄ       I always thought the purple and yellow was a cool look  that's the old style  I like the light on the handle bars better to
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Always great videos! Keep it up bro!!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Man tht Banshee is so nasty!! Thts my fav color scheme on a Shee!! ü§ò U did a amazing job on it!! Heck what am i saying.......everything u build is sick!!! üëçü§ò
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Great Video Brother! That‚Äôs definitely a blast from the past ü§ô
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Your scientific skills are amazing!!!üòÇ love the videos!!!üòéüí™
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I always wonder how quads get in such bad shape.  Mine is garage kept.  You can avoid a vast amount of deterioration by just keeping it out of the elements.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I can‚Äôt wait for the 240 build I‚Äôve been wanting todo the vitos 240 but just need to get it running first
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Hey Mike, my left ear enjoyed a lot üòÖ
Awesome video as always .
Greetings from Portugal"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,that thing is gonna be nice. Cant wait to see it.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,ü§òü§òü§òü§ò love the little Blasters......fun little machines
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,was some of the slow throttle retune due to it rubbing on that grip end?
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,That throttle was getting stuck because of the grip üòÇ
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Michael you can easily restore those plastics with magic erasers!! It‚Äôll change your life 2-3 swipes with awesome and it‚Äôll leave it stunning!!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Maybe go with the black leaving the seat red to match the frame I think it's a good buy for you who can perform the surgery this Quad needs next time let Benji test ride it just in case the brakes don't work ü§£üòÇüôèjust kidding I love benji bless him üíô
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,It looked like the thumb throttle was just sticking on the hand grip.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"No Mike, thank you for posting your videos..keep em coming...Happy Holidays"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Do a revival at the sight and ride the quad home like vgg does ""will this blaster that has been sitting for months run and drive HOME 300 miles?"""
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Bro, the last blaster I flipped. Base nuts were all 4 loose. Jug lifted up cpl mm. Still ran. Made a knock at high rpms so that's what led to me noticing. Fixed the knock and jetting issues lol. Current blaster build is a near prestine full oem bike. All new internals including bearings. Gonna put top end on 2moro and be done. Same style as yours but blue. Deff a slouch compared to my 521 but I'm still stoked for this build and the vids that come with it!!! Call it Lil dually lmao"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Bent the brake handle towards the front to add a curve to it the same as if u dropped the bike
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"I know when I hear the word "" Jank "" that it's going to be a great episode lol.. I'd Do Black Plastics and Red Frame if it were me, Make it sinister.."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,It's not running the best I can hear a bit a piston  probably due to the Chinese top end can't wait to see this series I'd like to see a high horse mx build ü§ôü§ôü§ô
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Yaaaaaaaaas! Currently building my 3rd blaster, so excited how you do this one up!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Love this, blaster is my favourite! üòä"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"All the smoke could be caused by running bigger jets also. Being that carb came off a banshee, the jets might not need to be so large"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Keep it red and white, powder coat the swing arms and white frame red!!"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Your thumb throttle lever is getting stuck on the dirt bike grip, causing it to hang open.

I like your main jets not being interchangeable with  genuines. Here's a TRUE story about outsourcing to china. An old friend of mine was doing non destructive testing on car mirrors outsourced to china back in the 1980s. They kept failing. The chinese weren't using the spec'd materials or sizes. When asked why, they said that it ""WEIGHS THE SAME"".

Also, do you remember enough about the zilla to do an ASS DYNO on it?

Lastly, any word on your Lakota exhaust system?"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"ü§£ idk why its so funny, but when you had it running and you did the zoom in/slowdown/boom had me dying"
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I need one of those awesome spark plugs üòâ lol üòÇ. Great video thanks for sharing. You rock üëè
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,We always use mother's aluminum polish on plastics.  Works great!
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"The Assdyno really cracked me up. üòÇüòÇ Love the videos man, I enjoy watching."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I really love your videos keep it up
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"that old carb  looks like a molkt28mm. 
in finland people use those most of the time for 125-212cc 4strokes, most of the time they are jetted out of the box around 100main 38pilot (somewere close to what a small 4stroke would use). 
somebody probably just slapped it on there and called it a day."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Do you plan on reselling the blaster after the challenge and if so where can you find that information
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,The throttle seems to be getting caught on the bottom of the grip and that can also be why it‚Äôs getting stuck
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,The throttle I took notice it‚Äôs hanging up on the grip the collar around the grip if you cut a little bit off the bottom it might work
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Please never stop doing little edits like the one at 19:27. Those little things crack me up haha
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Handlebar grip was holding the throttle open
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Everytime i watch one of your videos, I find myself looking at facebook at the same time... you are dangerous for my wallet XD. Also, how many times did you have to reshoot you throwing the carb behind you into the trash? that was clean."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I love the look of the banshee next to the blaster ü•µ
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"""Ass dyno"".. Lol, love it. Awesome project, Mike."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Love the vids just sold my blaster got it to flip but it was a nightmare quad
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,the carb throw had me dead
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,please let us know what jets you use when its fully built im trying to get my jetting perfect i have the same exhaust
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,"Get a set of Boysen Power Reeds and it'll give it a little extra grunt, they go for about $30 a set which isn't too bad. I know one other thing some people like doing is installing a set of rear hubs that are similar to the Banshee's so you can run a 9"" Banshee rim in the back instead of an 8"". Once your Top Quad series is done and you want to start adding some Go-Fast bits to it Vito's sells a replacement intake boot that makes it so you can run a larger carb on it.  They also sell a complete top end rebuilt kit that includes the 240 big bore and a stroker crank for $800. Of course that was the price when I last looked at it which was pre-covid. So who knows how much it is now."
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Ok meat check it out I have a buddy who used to work for yamaha back in the day he had never seen one in red. His thought on it is if you find one it was some special model for something.when I was on the phone with him he also said if you find red plastics they will be expensive AF. But red seat covers and other plastics won't be hard to find.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,throttle getting caught on the grip.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,All black with red rims and red grips and accents would look good
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Always a good day when you post ü§òüèª
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,You just never give up!?üí™ Hope some day to see outlaw 525 ü§£ü•∑
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,The thumb throttle is hanging cause of the grip if you didnt notice lol
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,I notice putting a little bit of diesel can clean up plastics. Especially white plastics. Gas works as well but I found diesel to be the most effective.
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,Were did you get the banshee light covers üòç
2,E1DoBqYnJ9I,The throttle was getting hung up on the bottom of the grip
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"What a place to get in and out of , you earned your pay doing that haul!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Thanks for the Outside ride along Dauminique, that was
really cool hope to see more of these.üòÅüòÅ"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,It's amazing the ability and skills you have to handle that truck. Love your channel.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"wow, excellent driving Dauminique, really had to keep an eye on the pup, great job!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"God bless you girl, I couldn‚Äôt keep up with those trailers the way you do, I‚Äôd be a madman by the end of the day."
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Man, you made that look so easy!! Your experience is showing! Great job!"

2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Great reversing skills Niqi !  I've been driving since 1968, and had my first EVER minor bump at our local filling station last week !
Totally my fault, and the ladies car I damaged, she was very gracious about it.  I'm so pissed off and angry about what I've done ,
spoiling my clean record !!!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,14:13 Dauminquie those trailer dump camera angles are amazing & who was operating the forklift person knows what their doing also the dock looks awesome place to work.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Most impressive driving skills young Jedi ü§∫ü¶æüèÅüï∂

2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Impressive driving Dauminique!
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Awesome driving young lady!!!  Wonderful video angles!!!  I know nothing about pup trailers.  Would it be advantageous or even advisable to shorten the reach when inside the building?   You have an awesome channel,  I enjoy watching your career progress!!!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Thanks For Letting Us Ride Along!! Enjoyed!!

2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great video - your driving was on spot!  Good work!
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great video Dauminique love the camera action. How much weight was put on the truck and trailer those bags looked heavy. Oh the wheel wash grates looks beat up could be rough on tires. The Pro at work. üôãüëç
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Hi kiddo I really love video you‚Äôre pro going in and also backing up plus got see whole how tight place was and as always you and you‚Äôre families be safe üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great video and I just wondered where they are shipping from and keep up the good work God bless from GA and happy holidays and stay safe
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Are you doing a very good job I think girl you definitely know what you're doing take care and be safe
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great footage and DAMN Dauminique you can drive that truck like a sports car. Great job!! üëç
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great video!  Much better way to load and looks a little easier on the trucks. Do you guys have to have a TWIC card to work the docks?
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Well done young lady! Makes me think of the day back in the 80s hauling dirty dirt. Ole paint residue hazmat loads payed good but makes me wonder about glow in the dark things. HaHa.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Nice job!!! But wouldn't be easier to shorten up when dumping??
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Very well done on your last day of hauling contaminated bags
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Awesome work as always üòÅ
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,That's terrible to get in and out of !!! Awesome skills on your part !!!
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Perfect. Nice Driving. That's quite an obstacle course.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Great new view! Glad got to ride along loading!! Just think, if you get the drink cup truck n trailer you could be hauling multiple bags!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ Keep up the Great content!!!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great skill at handling that trailing dumper.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Dominique you drove the truck very well far out
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great camera place on the fork lift.Nice bagger ballet by the forklifts.And the camera on your trailer gave a great show.Looks like a barge shipment.From Alaska?
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,You did really good babe ‚ù§Ô∏è   love your skill and work ethic    You have me my many admirers
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Your amazing driver keep it up

2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"I like the new video view, and your a real legit driver WOW!!! THE BACK UP  SPECIALIST ! Great video."
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Thanks for sharing Beautiful Lady, bay-3 look's to be pretty tight quarters. Happy day to U!"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great camera angle of the loading of the bag's of dirt there young lady üíêüåπ
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,It seems that is quite labor intensive. It must be very costly getting rid of HazMat soil.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great video and a skillful bit of driving
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Another spot on video they just keep getting better and better
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,You are an Awesome Driver! Good Jon!!! üòú
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,great new angle content always good Cheers KUrt Australia
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,I love the footage nice job.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"It is a tight hole, but you handled it, like The Boss Trucker you are."
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Hey Dauminique, i always love seeing your videos, and admire who you are and what you do, but why only greet dump truckers on your channel? Why not expand to greet ""dump truckers and friends'? I am not a dump trucker and will never will be, but still love your channel."
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Any ideal what that dump building was, before it became a transfer station?"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,You were being a bag lady again ü§£pretty tight getting in and out of there. That's a good place for flat tires I bet that place is nail and screw heaven.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,What a pain in the ass dump site. The forklift cam was cool. Thanks!
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,She is a boss driver. Awesome.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Some jobs  suck - in the old  days the loading  dock was built for  40'  trailers  -  now they have  53' trailers and so hard to 
get in tight places  - truck is   12' from the  wall - takes  4  hours to get the  trailer in - you leg is almost  dead from  pushing 
in the clutch - Foreman you  need  an automatic transmission = Driver  - I won't  be  back here ! They use  53'  trailers  because
they hold as  much  as  a  railway  car !"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"Obviously I've missed what's in the bags and the weight, wondering why you only get one bag in the truck ,looking for more efficient ways I think ,but please correct me ü§ó"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Great job enjoy your videos
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Bay 3 is for professional drivers only!   üòÉ
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,That was cool. Nice job.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Of course you‚Äôre beautiful and I know you hear that all the time but you are absolutely awesome at what you do so sad we had a great woman like you at my work but not good looking so every one mad things so bad till she quit very very sad
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Gr8 maneuverability in that tite bay 2 unload
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,What's in the bags? Cement or ballast?
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,"That‚Äôs crazy they are driving on the ship üö¢ kool big fork lifts get me excited, thanks BigAl California, Tesla no no no , we aren‚Äôt ready for that ,lol nice thanks BigAl California"
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,I am very glad that I didn't have to get into that mess.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,Video was awesome. Thanks for different prospective.
2,cu9FZy9VF-k,nothing like fitting a 3 foot block in a 2 foot hole!

2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I‚Äôm loving the changes to the channel. I enjoy how you stop the fast play and talk to us in real time during the clean. That‚Äôs an awesome addition to the video.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I absolutely love watching this channel! When the customers say it looks better than when they first got it just tells you how amazing your work is!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Still can't understand how some people can let their car be that dirty... I mean, I'm not the most tidy person in the world but I try to clean my car at least once a month... You did a great job with this disaster of a car.... Respect to you."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Mitch, from 1985-1993 I professionally detailed cars. I really enjoy your brilliant work. We did not have the great cleaners and equipment like you do. We used shop vacs for sweeping and extraction, garden hoses with your typical garden spray attachments, and cheap cleaners. I won't mention brands and names out of respect to those companies. I worked in Florida for a while. The sand in the carpets/seats as well as black or darker colored cars were the bane of our existence. On tough stains, crayons, markers we used Acrosol (<---spelling?) it was harsh and we learned early on to be very careful with it on fabrics, plastics, etc. Your suggestion about being careful when cleaning out stuff/personal items is so true. Along those lines, the worst cut I ever had was washing under the wheel wells with the old style wash mitts. I sliced myself wide open and back then we shoved our hands into denatured soap (ouch!) then duct taped our hands and kept going.  Not recommended! LOL! As far as black or darker cars...there was a product that was designed for those paint colors. It was a challenge not to leave swirls behind. We used electric buffers. There was some trial error finding the right speed, pads, compounds, polishes, etc. It was one of the most rewarding jobs I have ever had to date. I enjoyed peoples reactions to our hard work. God Bless you!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"After that terrific preview the full video did not disappoint. You moved your ""editing chair"" to the shop. More comfortable than the desk for sure. After more vehicles for comparison, I'd like to hear how fast the upholstery dries with the new extractor. Another enjoyable video."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Wow what a trans formation!! I want to let you know I‚Äôm loving the extra effort you‚Äôve been putting into the video production since you‚Äôve moved to the new studio. Especially the addition of real time action and sounds you‚Äôve added. As well as the added spots you‚Äôre talking to the camera as well!!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I'd love to see a six month check-in to see what the cars look like after you worked so hard.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,That interior may be one of the nastiest ones I have seen on the channel! This detail just goes to show that you never know what you could find inside a car. Well done Mitch!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Wow, that was amazing! The difference before and after was like day and night! You outdid yourself on this one, and even better, you picked up my energy and mood for the Friday workday."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"This is why I only let my kids have water bottles with lids in the car, and only once they were old enough to open and close them themselves.  Some people's kids are obviously more challenging than others, so no judgement here.  Great transformation!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Great job as always. She really appreciated it, and it seems they bought it used and this really was the best she's ever seen it look. Very cool. I still can't believe she didn't remove the food and hygiene products before turning it over though. I won't even take a dirty car to the mechanic."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,How do you do it?!? The quality and standard you set is second to none. Well done! Bravo! The nail polish removal deserves an extra WHOA!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I like that you told us how long it takes you to create your masterpiece!  Please keep telling us how long these transformations take you!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Car looks great as usual! 
I grew up with four older sisters and two younger ones (and three brothers) Never encountered  a misplaced sanitary product.  That's just disgusting and poor parenting."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Mitch the Miracle Worker!!! You did an awesome job!!! Just wonder how long it will be before it looks the way it did before you started! 
Great work as always my friend!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Amazing job as always man.  To think the dealership I worked at wanted this level of detail on all trade ins in under 45 minutes lol
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I love watching these transformations, and I think it's awesome that Mitch does such a great job on every vehicle, regardless of what condition it comes to him in. Having worked in a college environment, I've seen dorm rooms and faculty offices that are every bit as bad as this, and some even worse. What often tends to be the case is that the person is in mental crisis, and has reached a point where they are simply too overwhelmed to improve the situation themselves. They can't face what seems to be such an impossible task. When they finally do receive the mental health services, having someone else come in and do a reset of their space is often necessary so they can focus on improving themselves without having the added stress and anxiety that looking at this mess gives them."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,That's pure hard work. You earn the respect of your clients as well as millions who watch you. Hats off to you brother!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I love how thorough you are in cleaning. I hope to find a detailer in my area that does just as well! I also don't want to rag on this parent too much, so I just won't. I know we are all not perfect, but....."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Hey Mitch, well what can you say about that. I can't believe how filthy that vehicle was. But with 9 kids and the Canadian winter, I don't think I'm that surprised to be honest. The owners reaction said it all. You have given her a brand new car. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, AWESOME Detail. You are at the pinnacle of your powers. I can't praise you enough. YOU ARE THE MAN. As always, great work Mitch üëç"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I love your videos! üòä I‚Äôve been detailing my own vehicles for a while now and it‚Äôs so therapeutic to me! Lol. I‚Äôm definitely going shopping in your store for more products! Wish you were in the states for detailing! üò¢
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Wow Mitch, you absolutely brought the Traverse back to life. I‚Äôm sure she must be really ecstatic. Mind blowing! Nice Job! Have a great weekend y‚Äôall."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Great video as always. Have you ever thought about mounting a go pro to the power washer you use to clean under cars?
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I'm sure this comment gets repeated often, but I just don't understand how people can let a car get this bad. You do great work and keep me motivated to keep my cars pristine! Also love the new shop!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Another excellent job Mitch! Loving the new work space!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Mitch, as usual, you did a fantastic job. The before pictures, especially the interior, proved you had your work cut out for you and you nailed it, again!  Look forward to your next adventure. Question: Mitch have you ever had a customer that you opted not to detail because the vehicle was so atrociously dirty?"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Absolutely AMAZING transformation Mitch. It literally looked like a different vehicle. Wow!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Master class in how to detail to perfection--even beyond all your other videos. You are the detailer's detailer. I didn't think you were going to be able to get the nail polish streaks out and would have to resort to dabbing on some nail polish remover--which might have stripped the fabric color and soaked through to the foam cushion seats--but you did it with your cleaner and steam! Relieved that the owner used protective floor mats, as the carpeting in those areas wasn't as heavily soiled as other parts. I guessed 13 hours for this detail--at 15 hours, I think this one might have been your longest detail! Beautiful job as always. It's almost painful that this vehicle will have to be driven on gravel roads again!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Great job on this detail. üíØYou had some very interesting finds inside that vehicle. ü§¶üòØ Little story for everyone. My parents had 5 children, and sometimes we were given punishment chores. One chore we all hated being given was cleaning the family car inside and out, usually it was at least 3 of us in trouble at the same time. üòÇ We did learn a lesson from having to do this, and that was to keep track of our litter until we reached home, or into the next rubbish bin. Still do this myself, after every long trip it is automatically clean the car time. Hi from Australia üëã"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Loving the candid break talking about the trim, looks like a difficult polish and replace for sure!! Kudos"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Superb job! I am thankful that I found your channel as I find your work as a great way to destress. In addition, you make the car detailing process so interesting and informational. It certainly feels like something I want to try myself."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Wow! Amazing as always Mitch!  Love the natural sounds and nice to see Mike!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Well i was expecting a rate after all this dirt and garbage, loved what you did Mitch and loved the owner reaction ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Love your videos, I‚Äôm a fellow detailer, completely mobile. Your videos from 3 years ago is what made me decide to get into this passion with my paint corrections certification and such. My question is do you put any concentrate cleaners Into your steamer along with your solutions you spray or do you use water only? I‚Äôve tried both ways. Seems it‚Äôs a hit or miss."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Amazing transformation, incredible work! I was wondering how do you take the seats out, like the whole process? And how do you clean them in case they have built-in heating?"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Seeing just how disgusting this car looked, i can only imagine what the engine looks like üò¢. Great job! Hopefully it will stay that clean for a long while."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I used to have a 2018 Traverse, so I know how much work that car was. My complete respect to you for handling the items you found inside. You completely transformed that vehicle into a like new state! I‚Äôll bet this lady will be a repeat customer for you, job extremely well done!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Those floormats were pretty well soiled! I would recommend letting some water soak through and saturate those floor mats before pressure washing it as it may save on water consumption. It's usually what I do for vehicles that are that dirty, especially living in California where water is a premium. üòÖ"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Question for you... Have you ever thought about weighing the car when it comes in? Then when you are done you can see how much you removed in trash dirt etc... Just an idea. Love the channel!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Holy **** !!  Unbelievable! You deserve a pizza, beer in front of a warm fireplace for this one or a wine and cheese snack!  First when you mentioned the temperature, my manhood crawled way up in my body to keep warm - NO WAY for me!  Then after that disgusting mess, you created a showroom vehicle!  Loved the white socks and guitar playing at the end - seriously, TOP NOTCH GUITAR skills there!  Fascinating Miracle Detailing!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I'm actually shocked that it came that clean.   Definitely an amazing job.   üëçüëçüëç
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Yeah awesome video mate üòÅ Have seen times when trapped dirt refuses to come out even with multiple hits with the extractor. I found after i get as much out as i can if i come back with the steamer i can pretty much blast out the remaining dirt and then go over it one more time with my extractor to get it perfect ü§©
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Great job as always.  Unfortuantely, many owners' vehicles will end up looking just like they did after a few days, especially with kids."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I'm very jealous of your detail shop,but I'm proud of the work that you do, it takes a lot of patience to make those cruddy vehicles look new again"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"What a truly amazing transformation! That was a gnarly mess! I am not sure what would have grossed me out more, the used pad or the meat!! It is kind of alarming how many used pads you have found in the last year! Just lucky I guess! üòÇ"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Canadian winters ü§£
Love to the super dirty details like this one. Really takes the car back in time to when it was driven off the lot. Great job Mitch üëè"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"That is hands down THE most gratifying transformation that you have done to date. Excellent job. Question though, is there concern about small scratches from the grit when it‚Äôs that bad?"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I love the fpv of the cleaning. Really ramped up on editing! I would be a member to support you, but budget tight rn"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I'm so glad some of the shots, especially when you are pressure washing, have no music now.  The music is nice, but sometimes it's nice to hear the sounds of the work being done!  Keep up the amazing content"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,A transformation for a workhorse. Amazing job as always!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"If I hadn't seen you clean that vehicle,  I would have never believed it was the same car. Incredible job man!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,15 hrs? Oh wow Mitch that was an Amazing transformation. Excellent job Mitch!!!!üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Love watching your vids. Would like to see how you tackle the roofs of some of these vehicles.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Looks awesome!!!! I give you A LOT of credit!!! I do my own car and mine doesn‚Äôt look close to some of the cars you do and mine takes 10 hours. Love the videos, keep ‚Äòem coming!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Fabulous workmanship Mitch the new studio looks amazing a credit to you for all your hard work hope it‚Äôs very successful love from Ireland and have a great Christmas and a prosperous New year Mitch üáÆüá™üòéüëè
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,you done  a great job on that vehicle in and out. this is a great channel i do like the way the owners  reacts to the before and after
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Good tip about being careful when cleaning out personal items.  I've hurt my hands on items with unexpectedly sharp edges before and also found live ammunition (12 gauge shells) before vacuuming under seats.  Best to take your time and ensure your safety.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Traverses are one of my least favorite vehicles to detail, great job on this one. Also don‚Äôt see many people pressure wash door/trunk jambs but when they are that bad it‚Äôs a must, saves tons of time"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,This was such a great transformation.  I had a Traverse and I get it ; it is hard to clean.  Please take a break cause you deserve it!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Awesome job removing the nail polish Mitch. Wasn't sure it was coming off even with the steamer. Quite the transformation-as usual!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Just love watching the caked on mud come off with the pressure washing. I have a feeling that when she‚Äôs about two blocks away that it might be a mess again with all the snow around.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I would be too ashamed to present any vehicle to a detailer in such a feral condition. And I certainly wouldn‚Äôt put my face on a video. You did a great job mate and I hope you charged that lady accordingly.
PS: I love how she blamed the kids."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Wow!  Awesome work Mitch, that's amazing.  I subscribe to quite a few Canadian based you tube channels and from what I can see it's really rural and undeveloped.  One channel is literally all dirt roads, it's so different from here in the states.  

But awesome work as always."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I couldn‚Äôt even tell that was ‚Äúwood grain‚Äù in the center console before. As always, good job man!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,This vehicle would make a great instructional video on how to fine clean your car.  There was a ton of hidden dirt that poured out with the pressure washer.  I'm guessing at least 4 passes on the carpet. How long did you let it soak ?
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Suggestion would be incorporating underbody before and afters too! It would be cool to see how much dirt accumulates
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I like that u chime in in the video here and there it's refreshing, Change is good sometimes! I also really like that head cam while pressure washing, I'd love to see that more! Amazing video video mitch as always!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Incredible transformation!!  Owner's reaction was unforgettable!  I hope that Mike doesn't totally take over that new cushy chair, boot him out if needs beüòâ"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I like those occasional 4th wall breaks where you directly talk to the camera instead of the voice overs. They add to the in real time shots you've been doing lately.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I don't know how someone can let their car get that bad! Amazing  detail though!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,It must be so nice to detail in your new shop! I‚Äôm happy for youü•∞‚úùÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Oh my gosh. That looks like so much fun blasting that dirt off!! Love it
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,OMG im in absolute shock seeing the difference üò≤man oh man you out did yourself on this clean for sure.... damn it looks freaking amazing ‚ù§
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"you, Mitch, went through quite some transformation for yourself in this video, mhm. from all calm and composed to like almost possessed by the devil himself when you hit that strings in the end ü§£"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I've gotta say, I'm impressed that you were able to get all that nail polish out of that fabric seat cushion.  Question, would you recommend going back over that with your extractor afterward to ensure there is no APC left behind since it is fabric?"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Excellent job as always, new studio/shop looks incredible. Seasons greetings and happy holidays to everybody out there, much love from Texas."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Great work man. If your kids are old enough to play lacrosse, they‚Äôre old enough to help mom clean the car out"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Mitch, I've been a fan for many years now and LOVE your talent, skill, and attention to detail! When are you going to finally switch to 4k?? Your videos would be 2x (if not more) satisfying and overall better quality if you shot and uploaded in full 4k! ü•∞"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Those floorliners really saved those carpets. Imagine what they'd look like with just standard ones.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,I loved every moment of this!Thank you DeeGee üéâ‚ù§
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"great transformation, new studio looks amazing.  Just wanted to say that kids make a huge mess VERY quickly.  Some people comment about the owner's cleanliness but please remember if you have a few of these little monsters running around, cleaning up isn't always as easy as you think."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"What a transformation üò≤I don't know how you deal with some interiors , such a perfectionist to get the carpets cleaned that well and all the nail varnish out (as well as everything else)üëçüëçüëç Love watching it. Must have got really cold if you are wearing socksü•∂ü•∂üòä"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Incredibly unbelievable transformation!  You are truly a detailing magician!!
Bravo!!!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Just amazing how much dirt was accumulated on and in the car. üéâawesome transformation
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Great job on the car! I was quite shocked by what you found in that car... Dirty pad (HOW AND WHY IS THAT THERE?!ü§¢ü§Æ...), old food (especially that meat), and other stuff. ü•¥I took a few microbiology courses and let's just say, I'm glad no one got sick from possible bacteria (listeria, e.coli... I hope there are none). Be safe guys and remember to check your car when you come home from the store!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Watched the whole thing and I have feelings-  IMPRESSED with DG's thorough job, DISGUSTED at the squalor of this vehicle, and ASTOUNDED at the slovenly owner's shamelessness."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"The descriptions and the ""raw"" video without the music and at normal speed is a nice break from the usual.
The new shop looks great!"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,for those parts where you have to kneel down to apply the shine on the plastics parts you should built a knee pads with wheels like the one tile people use when installing tile! give it a look it‚Äôll help you a lot tho!! its called rolling knee pads! i seen them at Harbor freight in the US!!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, you're a magician üé© doing such an amazing job especially the inside of the vehicle"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,You outdid yourself. Amazing job on this vehicle.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"Amazing job, as always.
I wonder what kind of blow back you get from the customers who's personal 'hygiene' practices get revealed in these videos,"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,You Have Made Detailing Looked So Easy. Good Job üëç
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,This is very satisfying to watch all that snow and mud wash away
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,WOW!!!! That was an amazing transformation!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"I can't imagine the smell of rotting deli meat on top of all the other nastiness.
Once again, great job."
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,Never doubted you for a second on that seat stain! I nodded with approval at the before and after lol!
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,The first thing I ever did once I had children was buy Seat Covers for the seats where my kiddo's car seats were. Every time we have since purchased new cars the first thing I buy are seatcovers and a dashmat. Unbelievable how much they protect your car from annoying spills or the harsh sun (here in Australia) cracking the dash.
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,"It did look awesome at the end, you could have just sprayed off all the mud and did a vacuum, take all the big stuff out and call it a day and it looked better. BUT, what does something like that cost to have done?"
2,0SZrfxQY4nY,It always amazes me how can a car get to be this dirty while using it especially the interior
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Have a great upcoming weekend!

Submit your photos/clips at www.justrolledinyt.com"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That last one just left me speechless. The number of critical thinking errors it took her to get to that point is astounding.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I like how the girl just gets up and walks towards her car like it happens all the time.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Sometimes I feel down about myself like I‚Äôm not that smart, then you post a video and I‚Äôm all good again üòÇ"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,They found the zero emissions hack on that exhaust system
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Things I've learned on this channel:
- People think tires have infinite tread
- Don't let ""someone you know"" weld anything on your car
- What bullet holes?
- Don't let the lube shop touch your car if you still care about it
- people are nasty"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Customer:  ""I did the work myself.""
Mechanic:  ""You don't say!""
Customer:  ""Can you fix it?""
Mechanic:  ""I can but I won't."""
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I would love to hear their thought process behind cutting the tank open to replace the fuel pump.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That last clip, happened to me when I was a kid. Memorial day, I get off work at midnight, was on my way home and I made a right turn when my dome light came on. I look over and my door was swinging open. So I grab the door, and because of the turn, it continued to swing open. Because my car was a 1987 Pontiac Firebird, it only had 2 doors, which were longer than average in order to be able to access the back seat. Longer than average doors = heavier than average doors. Had I of let go of the door, I would of stayed in the car, but I held on to the door, and not wearing a seatbelt, I was left laying in the middle of the street and my car continued without me. It went up to a house, and because it was uphill, it stopped without doing any damage. Last time I drove without a seatbelt, even just moving in a parking lot at 2 MPH, for me, a seatbelt is now just instinct, don't have to think about it."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Shop: ""Yeah, just drive it in""
Girl from the last clip: ""Alrighty then."""
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Crazy to know these vehicles are on the road with us!!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That last clip reminded me of my first car in 80s.  I had a 1969 Dodge Dart.  The rear passenger door would not latch sometimes.  I had a bunch of friends in the car and I insisted on everyone using the seatbelts even though that wasn't very popular.  I went around a corner rather quickly and sure enough that door flew open and scared the *@#*)&@$ out of the guy sitting there.  I said that's why I made you use your seat belt!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I would suggest an hour long video once a year, with you and your mechanic friends telling us stories about your work, customers, and best days and worst days!!  That would be fun.
Wouldn't it?"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That‚Äôs how you save money, only replace one pad at a timeü§£"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,It never ceases to amaze me what some people do or not do to their vehicles.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I've actually witnessed that last one first hand back in the 80's before the seatbelt laws came in. A guy in a VW turned left, the drivers door shot open, he was hanging out of the car and clinging onto the steering wheel one handed with his arse dragging on the road, the car mounted the kerb, he fell out and the now unmanned motor went straight through the sixteen foot tall plate glass window of a department store, through the window display, through the plyboard back of the window display, before burying itself into the perfume counter. I honestly still can't understand how anyone wasn't killed or injured."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Another shop, usually run by an unlicensed relative or self owned. A true classic"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That last one was sooo lucky that happened at a relatively low speed. Not so good for the shop front though.
Thanks for the videos. Be safe out there, and take it easy man."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"This is better than any comedy show. It's hilarious what people do to their cars. Each clip is a masterpiece, keep it up! üëçüèª"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"1:44 made me laugh harder than I probably should have, but that's the power of fart jokes xD"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Whenever I get the notification of a new video, I start to feel better knowing it's going to prove I'm not the worst at taking care of my cars ;)"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I feel really good about the fact that I've done a lot of work on my own cars and it was always a job done right.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Thanks for posting the photo of my Fiat Spider! Gotta say this was one of the more crazy videos. The one with one exhaust bank feeding right back into the other is totally insane!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I feel for the guy with the gunshot in his hood.  So easy to do when using your car as a rest - while your scope can see over your hood the barrel can't!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Don't worry about the wheel falling off, it just needs an alignment ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ . These videos never fail to brighten my day. üôèüëç"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I was not even in the car how can I get blamed for the accident?
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That girl at the end needs to star in her own action movie lol
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That cross connected exhaust from the headers is about the most hilarious thing I've seen. The phrase  "" What The Hell Were They Thinking""  just doesn't do it justice !  What's nice about it is that no one will get hurt from a bad self repair job like many others seen here. BECAUSE THE CAR WON'T RUN ! ! !"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Damn! I sure am glad to live in Poland where we have mandatory annual checks. But still there is this thing called common sense that seems to be missing here :) Love your videos
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Love the anti-theft headers!  Also like how they solved the problem of thieves stealing their catalytic-converters!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I stopped today to tell a lady that her exhaust was broken, as the muffler was broken off and hanging about an inch off the ground, she got out of her car and was like I know just haven‚Äôt got it fixed yet and then she walked into a nail salonü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,What a wonderful introductory video to this channel for me! I've never screamed for 3 solid minutes of my life until now.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Over the decades I‚Äôve been a technician I‚Äôve seen plenty of ID10T hacked trash like that Subaru roll into my shop. Sadly the managers above me usually won‚Äôt let me turn them away.  Pretty much everything else this channel shows I‚Äôve seen too. In my opinion yearly safety inspections should be required nationwide. The vast majority of people have no idea just how incredibly unsafe the car traveling next to them at 80mph may be. The state I live and work in does have yearly safety inspections but sadly the state 5 miles away does not. Oh my god the amount of unsafe garbage that rolls in with the other state‚Äôs tags on it is amazing. Truly scary to think of when my family is out there on the road.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Gonna bet that door latch was a whole lot cheaper than paying for the damages or increased insurance for the next 5 years. People are stupid. Also, she‚Äôs lucky she didn‚Äôt get run over by another car."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I've been wasting so much money when I do my brakes. I thought you had to put 2 pads per wheel, but now I  know it's put 1 pad on and save the other for next time. Thanks for the info  !!!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"""Another shop did____""  Yeah, I get customers that call in and lie. Woman bought items in May, she wants to return them. There is a 90 day return policy. I explained that. Very much Karen like, she demanded to speak to a supervisor. Supervisor told her the same thing. ""I'll just take my business elsewhere!!"" Bye, don't let the door hit you in the butt on the way out."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I dont remember much from being a kid but i still remember the S bend down the road where i was born and 1 day  we were rounding that bend in an old ford consul when the passenger door flew open and i shot across the bench seat and halfway out of the door, my mum grabbed my ankle and slowed to a stop with me looking at the gutter wizzing by 3"" below me."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"There are many things I don‚Äôt understand, but I truly do not understand why people don‚Äôt wear their seat belt. It‚Äôs about as easy as using your turn signals (which a lot of people also choose not to do).

I hope that none of these rocket surgeons who choose not to wear their seatbelt ever crash into me, because I do *not* want to be involved in their serious injury or death from a minor fender bender."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,this has to be one of the most jaw dropping episodes of just rolled in in quite a long time üòß
2,NIWhci_JzW4,wonder what counts as a ''speed bump'' for some people üòÇ
2,NIWhci_JzW4,2:36 I can drive for hours with that new chime. Reminds me of my old video games. Nostalgic. üòÇ
2,NIWhci_JzW4,The last one gives a whole new meaning to the term ‚ÄúAbandoned Vehicle!‚Äù
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Once my mom ‚Äútried‚Äù to replace the front left tire my stepdad who was a mechanic told her she was turning the lug nut the wrong wayüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,NIWhci_JzW4,You hit the jackpot on this one. Especially the last clip. üòÜ üëç üëç üëç
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"the way that girl fell out of the car 2:43 was like an action movie, like the truck was filled with an explosive and she wanted to blow up the shop"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,There are times when watching this channel (and I love watching this channel) that I think that it should be illegal to do your own work on a car without being licensed to do so.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Thanks guys for the laughs of the day. Thank God for real mechanics, I can't believe how many idiots have a lisence to drive. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I'm not a professional mechanic, but I do think that those exhaust pipes might be experiencing some back pressure issues ..."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I‚Äôd sue the last one. Imagine knowing ur door latch is broken and ur still driving without a seatbelt too? Clearly reckless and could‚Äôve actually killed someone.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Aren't you glad there's so many car owners are such experts at fixing cars
2,NIWhci_JzW4,1:38 The problem is obvious. The aluminum foil goes between the intake and the engine. With it's current position it's trapping engine heat and reducing the efficiency of the entire system.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I'm continuously amazed at the confidence and... ahem... ingenuity... of these home repairs.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"You just watch, she'll sue GM for the broken latch causing the accident, pain, suffering and mental anguish!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I watch these videos when I need motivation to fix all the wack things wrong with my shitboxes- the exact same way I watch Hoarders when I need motivation to clean my house
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"If I didn't see happen, I would say no way! Great clips, keep them coming."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"1:38 Still remember when I worked at a lumber yard, had a kid come in looking for PVC pipe and fittings.  I couldn't quite figure out what he was working on because the parts were random, so I asked him and he told me he was building a cold air return for his car.  I told him that was a bad idea because the pipe wasn't rated for high temps and could melt and set his car on fire.  He put the parts back and left the store.

I hope I saved his life."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"People should undergo a minimum training and certification just to be allowed to own a vehicle, let alone drive one!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I‚Äôve often heard that a little back pressure in the exhaust is good for horsepower.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"When I watch this I feel so much better about myself. That cold air intake was so cool probably adds 50 horsepower. I've seen that IRL before too and I'm so happy for them. Remove the air box the inlet tube or pipe, put a cone filter from auto zone on there. That is a dyno proven intake at least 50 horsepower added instantly. The turbo will be so powerful and the exhaust cut off will make the turbo better too that's another 50 horsepower. ü§™ü§¢ü§Æ Cops don't even work anymore so you can do anything you want."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That exhaust is actually a very neat job, compared to the rats nest of mig wire that we usually see. Shame they forgot one vital principle though."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I‚Äôm a contractor, and often have to correct problems from do it yourselfers, and so called contractors, sometimes I just have to say no as the situation is near hopeless and I‚Äôll become associated with the project or worse liable in any form!, these mechanics are in the same boat, if the owner of the vehicle leaves and an accident occurs the lawyers will be sending their letters!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,When she literally...Just Rolls In
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I feel so smart every time I watch your show.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Jesus, these videos make me thankful I've never had an issue with my rear diff."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Most of these clips make me very glad for the annual MoT test here in the UK.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"I remember when my car driver's door latch broke, I brought it in to the shop that morning, boy what a wonderful time that was taking a left turn with one hand on the wheel and the other holding the door closed like my life depended on it

Also that ford that won't stop chiming seems like the ECU is fried. Actually I'll double down and say all the electronics in the car are just fizzled up"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"There is definitely no shortage of insane damage to vehicles, WOW üò≥üò≥üò≥"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Customer:  ""All it needs is...""
We JRI viewers:  ""This will be good..."""
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That exhaust one made me chuckle. Of course it won't start lol
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"LOL üòÇ,  I was operating a trackhoe on the side of the Florida Turnpike in Orlando and a car was smoking and drove right behind me in the dirt  and I spun around and watched the lady just fall out of her car and let the car keep  rolling. A minute later it was on fire. Women freak out over nothing."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Amazing at all the home mechanics that do their own work to save money and it‚Äôs not hard to do! Look at how much more money it costs to fix it now!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,This channel should win the MOST PAUSED/REPLAYED in 10 Minute AWARD. üëç
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"2:55  ""Definitely an argument for fixing those broken door latches/locks,"" phooey!  Definitely an argument for wearing the bloody-damn seatbelt, which is what the law requires in every state, and why noncompliance is penalized!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,if my door wasn't latching correctly last thing i'd do is not wear my seatbelt
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"2:43 I almost did this once. Was taking an old truck I was working on around the block. It had a bench seat and lap belts buried under decades of random crap, so I wasn't wearing them. I took a corner kind of fast and the side door flew open. I only just caught myself on the wheel before I fell out entirely."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Some folks don‚Äôt understand that compressing the piston(s) on the disc brakes resets the capacity to accept more than one pad! Let alone all the other items required in preforming a thorough brake change‚Ä¶‚Ä¶might better just turn in the car when the brakes are shot!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"""Another  shop did it"" or ""Another mechanic did it"" translates to ""I did it myself but am to embarrassed to admit to the shoddy work."""
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Think how much money you save on mufflers when you attach one side of the exhaust to the other hahaha. That was amazing!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,2:11 How to pass emission test... for 5 seconds worth of engine run time.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"The more of these that I watch, the more that I think that driver licensing must have some kind of basic auto mechanical knowledge testing..."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,really made my day. the best compilation so far
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Howling with laughter here. That exhaust clip - genius way to reduce emissions??ü§£
2,NIWhci_JzW4,2:12 These new emissions compliance regulations are getting a little crazy...
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Just FYI, cars in the USA do get annually inspected in some states, especially if they're more recent models. It just doesn't stop people from perpetrating this kind of nonsense."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,Gotta love that wireless exhaust!!!!
2,NIWhci_JzW4,2:11 That's one of those new 'closed loop' exhaust systems. Guaranteed Zero Co2 emissions. üòÜ
2,NIWhci_JzW4,You know after watching so many of your videos I have figured out what my next vehicle will be!! A 20 ton Shermin Tank. Yea fuel mileage will suck but I know I can get from point a to be and back and live to see another day.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That U-turned exhaust is amazing.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Seatbelts aren't just to protect you.  They keep you in position to operate your car.  Just remember, racers are REQUIRED to wear them.  If they can do it, so can you."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"One takeaway from these: If your door flies open on corners, wear your seat
belt!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,2:11 The cleanest car.. 0% emissions. You don't need to secure the catalytic if you car doesn't needs one XD
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"To the owners of these vehicles: I beg you‚Ä¶please take the bus, I‚Äôm feeling very unsafe out there."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,00:50 When you cant afford an electric car so you take matters into your own hands.
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"That last one takes, ""Just rolled in"" to a whole new meaning!"
2,NIWhci_JzW4,That closed-circuit exhaust was some next-level tomfoolery :))))))
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"The shop at the end can probably sell her a working door latch, but they don't sell the parts to fix the other issue."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,"Am I the only one who absolutely refuses to believe the ""door latch was broken and wasn't wearing seatbelt"" story? She did a textbook bail out after steering that DIRECTLY at the window. Come on."
2,NIWhci_JzW4,An alignment WILL fix that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,NIWhci_JzW4,I really hope that more sobriety programs become available because its obvious that meth is a hell of a drug.

2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Nobody acts that aggressively unless something was done. Eto'o probably got mad for something that guy said for clout.
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Let this be a lesson: ‚ÄòIf you f*** around, you‚Äôre gonna find out‚Äô"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Hope he'll lose some money, the money he never gave to his daughter."
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Good job Eto'o
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Que vient faire un supporter alg√©rien au qatar  ??? 
C'est dingue , vous √™tes la honte de ce pays et on devrait vous enlever votre nationalit√© alg√©rienne."
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Merci fr√®re Eto'o
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Oh no! i think he lost it
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Un comportement totalement indigne.
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"This is bad of you Eto'o 
As a leader be ready to confront all type in persons and insults. Your reaction prove you are guilty of the crime. You have given your country a very bad image. You need to be sanctioned in Qatar and in Cameron"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Stop bullying and harassing People with your camera and words You obviously started something when he was minding his own business with people taking selfies .
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Nice shoot ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëå
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Merci beaucoup eto
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,he doesnt have the right to  take a video of him  in that abusif way he asked for it
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Nice etoo üí™
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,pep guardiola was right
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Samuel eto is own bodyguard but need to be more careful next time is going to have to pay this clown in court
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Good job! Show some respect to da name and Cameroon! ü§£ ü§£ ü§£
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"¬øRevela esto la guarder√≠a de Eto'o? 
Obviamente, no todo buen jugador de f√∫tbol tiene que ser una buena persona..."
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Au final, c'est Pep Guardiola qui avait raison!
Un voyou, restera un voyou. Un maillot ou une chemise ne changent rien au personnage üòÖ"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Just wtf üò≥

2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Jorge Masvidal approves
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Eto should try UFC
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Not a foul, play on"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Samuel Eto‚Äôo is corrupted
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Well done
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Unprofessional man we uncouth behavior.
A man with rather silly ideas"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Gotta put some respect on his name for that flying kneeüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Title is misleading... 1 vicious knee a good 10 seconds after people intervene to try and stop a fight... Hardly beating him up... I don't condone this behaviour especially when the man was bent over sorting his stuff out...
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,If there‚Äôs anyone that needs to face penalty it is the YouTuber for putting Etoo in that situation. Racism is punishable by law and it is called a hate crime. We are all African.
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Vive algeria vive fennecs
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"ESTE LLAMADO YOUTUBER NO TIENE DERECHO A ACOSAR A UN CIUDADANO MENOS A FILMARLO SIN SU PERMISO, SOBRE TODO PORQUE NO TIENE CARNET DE PERIODISTA!!!"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"The camera Man must have said something racist about etoo ,no way would attack a simple man for nothing"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,He wanted to create a YouTube story out of somebody...but now a YouTube story was created out of him . Reverse episode 1
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Il croyais que c'√©tait un ballon.
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Quelle classe ce Samuel... Imb√©cile...
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"The way I see it. ETO should be in jail rn or at least pay half what he owns to that guy to get away with it. ETO SHOULD STAYED IN Africa, he's not used to civilization and freedom of speech..the Algerian government is mos def going to make him pay for attacking its citizen like that! They got strong connections with Caf, Fifa and strong relations with Qatar. And they been putting him under a lot of pressure way before this incident after that ""controversial match"".I  know for a fact that many countries will prevent him from entering their lands after the video"
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"That's when Eto'o's nursery comes to light again.
Obviously, a good football player doesn't have to be a good person..."
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,Cheh c'est bien pour sa gueule bravo Samuel üëçüëèüëèüëè.

2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Nice work Eto'o, the guy was smiling the whole time he was saying these things, he was trying to provoke a reaction. Got what he deserved."
2,6nwfpY3VV5w,"Le youtubeur est devenu connu et le tout le scandale pour Etoo, voila ce qui arrive quand on a une cervelle de fourmis"

2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"No matter where Mrs Wizard points her camera, there's always one of Hoovie's tragedies lurking in the back. Can't wait to see and hear that sweet Caddy when it's ready. Keep up the good work!"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I used the same method to rebuild the engine on my C4 Corvette and my Porsche 928.  It's the way they were put together at the factory, actually pretty easy!"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Hey Wizard & Mrs Wizard, Happy Holidays!!! You are really making progress on the Cadillac, I am a big fan of this model!!! I can't wait till it's finished!!! üéÑ‚õÑü§∂"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Hi wizard, i used to work at the foundry that made the exhaust manifolds for that car. The cats were welded on as a brazed joint wouldn't be able to handle the heat. The weld is that good, that it looks like it's brazed. We had an automated process, it was that good."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"To keep it perfect, one might use Evans ""Waterless"" coolant on final assembly."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Congratulations on the launch of your boat! I once commented that boat ownership is like filling a wheelbarrow with money and taking it to the dock and dumping it in the water, then repeating that until the boat leaves."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Most people dont realize the effort any engine swap is. Great work and looking forward to that caddy getting back on the road.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I see Hoovie‚Äôs miracle XKE in the background. Been dying to see what adventures await the replacement rear main seal. Awesome video on the XLR, always interested by things like inaccessible fuel pumps."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Wizard having extra fun today and Mrs. Wizard being extra funny!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I recently had the fuel pump replaced in my C6. Thankfully, they found a way to remove both tanks without having to drop the drive train. Just drop the exhaust. But, still, because of the high milage and age, I had both tanks dropped and everything plastic, rubber, sensor-ed, gaskets replaced. And the bill was still over $4K. The pump & level sender together are $2K! There is one active pump, a syphon pump and a jet pump. The fuel moves from the right tank to the left when being used. It's a horrid setup and I don't think there's any way to cut into the rear hatch floor to gain access to the top of the pump...Like one can do with a Caddy single tank setup."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,I wonder how many XLR‚Äôs they needed to sell to keep the model going. I‚Äôd love to have one based on the C7 and now the C8.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"The dealer dropped the left tank from my 17 Stingray and replaced the fuel pump under warranty without dropping the drivetrain.  They removed the rear facia and the left muffler and were able to reach in and disconnect the fuel crossover hose.  The book time is over 12 hours to do it ""the right way"" but it takes less than half that time doing it more creatively."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,I‚Äôm so happy that you explained it why the LS would be so difficult to put in that‚Äôs one of the things I wanted to do when I XLR but now I know thank you
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,It's a good thing the Wizard is a mechanic. I can't imagine the cost of paying a shop to do this kind of work.I'd like to see a time-lapse video of Danielson swapping over the parts and accessories from one engine to the other.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Hey Mr. Car Wizard, loving all your content and videos, especially these XLR videos, there really cool brother.
I've been wanting to ask a question: 
Do these LH2 Northstar engines have piston oil squirters???"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Sitting on the back of that drive shaft was hilarious caught me off guard üòÜ
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,I have a Northstar DTS and I love it. One of the best cars I've ever owned. Smooth and powerful and really good on gas.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I replaced 1 of those exhaust manifold/ cat converter combos recently on an 06 canyon, the guy really paid like $800 for the part"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Now this was your best video for years. Great info and none of the B'S and whining that is usually synonymous with Wizard videos... and the humour was great...
I just wish you could keep them all like this... I enjoyed this video 100%..."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"It will be sweet! Love my XLR! I have had that gas tank repairs done, about 4 years ago, at the time it was $2500"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I've seen this done with the full size Ford trucks, I guess it's the easiest way to deal with ecoboost engines or the 6.0 and 6.4 liter diesels."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I had a 2000 Cadillac STS, it also had a water cooled alternator. They were only used for 1 or 2 years in that model due to issues."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,How could you forget to play the car loft tune while lifting the body? You dropped the ball Wizard!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Now that you've gutted the mufflers you're going to be one of the No Muffler Newton bros, eh Wizard?!?"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Great video, never knew they were build like that üëçüèº"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I had high flow cats, manifolds, X pipe, flowmaster 10‚Äôs installed. Let me tell you they sound freaking great. I was forced to do my exhaust system. This was the cheapest and awesomess route. Cadillac‚Äôs cats suck. I highly recommend you do the same."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Nice job Wizard, just subscribed... Love your interactions with Hoovie..."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Nice video. I can‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs involved if you have to replace the fuel pump
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Oh now that is really cool wizard! That is quite a bit of engineering.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Having the catalytic converters there would make them almost impossible to steal
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Well, gearbox in the back with torque tube connecting to the motor were used also in the Porsche 924, 944, 968 and 928.

The Alfa Romeo type 116 ch√¢ssis had a transaxle gearbox in the back, too, but did not use a torque tube - that was one of the reasons why the gear change was famously poor on that type (although in the SZ-RZ they had managed to fix most of yhe issues)."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I would have the Urge to put an LS in front of that torque tube , but the Northstar is a very cool engine"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I felt it when you talked about the cat beeing a part of the manifold. On my Audi the DPF is in the same part as the cat, so when (not if) the DPF gets glogged and destroyed the cat also has to be changed. The part is 3000 EUR from Audi..."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,I never knew the transmission and transaxle was in the rear of these things. What could go wrong?üòÇ
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Thanks Wizard this was a good video and you sitting on the trans was hilarious.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I love Mrs Wizard‚Äôs questions, but when will she bow down to the absolute awesomeness of the car genius formally known as the Wizzzzard?????"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,There will come a point when Omega Auto Clinic's will be more a film studio that happens to fix cars on the side than a auto repair facility that shoots youtube videos. :D
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Lol wow I felt that you answered my question on the previous video about LS swapping.  Makes a lot of sense now.  It would be mission impossible or mission oh gosh darn it should have kept it original.  I am excited for the grand reveal now.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I would weld a seat on to the torque tube, slap a radiator and fuel tank in the rear, maybe a few X braces and put aomw of those weird leaf springs like the C4, and see how it drives ü§£"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Another great video from the wizard. Keep it up
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"David you and your wife make very fine AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO.....This old fighter pilot in my 80's thanks y'all.......             
Shoeüá∫üá∏"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,All vehicles should be able to be serviced like that!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Only in the last year would it even begin to make financial sense to do what you're doing and that's even factoring in your free labor. You've made bullet proof only the mechanical parts of the engine. What about the as-poorly-designed older transmission or heaven forbid, the exceedingly complex and failure-prone electrical and electronic systems? These cars are perhaps the worst GM's ever sold for electrical problems and that's saying something. Stealerships had to have specially trained XLR technicians or they were not allowed to work on these pieces of junk. I can't believe I am watching the same person idolizing Toyotas and Hondas on one episode and throw $3000 of free labor into this thing. On the other hand, if the market produces idiots willing to pay good money for these atrocities, then I guess you're on the right track."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Love the more indepth videos üëçüèª
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Very cool to see your Caddy split in half!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Just like a 1966 beetle!‚Ä¶..although the beetle is a bit more compact.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Wow a liquid cooled alternator - I had to look it up - 150 Amps - over 2100 Watts (peak). That's a fair amount of juice!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Reminds me of my 94 Toyota truck. It's easier to disconnect the wires from the computer and lay em on top of the motor and pull it out
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Very very cool video, looking forward to the video of the next step üòä"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Please more bus videos... or Ferrari videos... how come every time Wizard starts a fun project and I get all invested, then we never see the end of it :("
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"You don't need too much money, fab a Hemholtz pipe and stick it before muffler. It will eliminate drone and put out sharper tones. You can then afford a smaller muffler in return. Saves your hearing on cruise, too."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Yes, the engine bell bolt patterns are different from the Northstar metric 60 pattern, and the standard Chevy bell pattern LS.
You'd probably have to get a Corvette bell housing and everything else,,, just not worth it... Plus I bet the smaller displacement Northstar will get better fuel mileage, and still make 320 horsepower."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Wizard: some of you who know corvettes already know about this

Cleetus McFarland and his viewers: Hell yea brother.

Wizard: *proceeds to take the powertrain in one piece*

Cleetus: *surprised pikachu face*"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Unbelievable, so well done....wow!!!"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Hey Dave: J&J is right in my backyard in Marshallville, Ohio where the state's largest meat market is also located; so, when you get your Caddy parts, you can get steaks for the grill for dinner too.... From the home of PB Blaster Silicone spray.... Cleveland, Ohio....."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Wizard go on and change the fuel pump! You have got it cracked open! Do it! üëçüèæ
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Wiiizard moves awful darned fast, on a personal project, if someone is actually paying him for it!!!"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,When you finish the caddy please jump back on the chevelle really want to see how the jag runs with duel quads üëç
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"‚ÄúWow Wizard, that‚Äôs a really long shaft!‚Äù I bet that‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs said that to Wizard lololol"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Cat went out on my 06 Civic which is part of the manifold, $1300 for just the part from Orielly‚Äôs. I paid a guy $200 to take my existing one off, cut it open, gut it, weld it back shut, & slap it back on."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I sure miss the days of a positive, 2 ground wires,a fuel line, radiator,and a transmission to disconnect in order to swap an engine.Don't you??"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,I'm a little surprised to hear that you hate manuals! Is there anything in particular that makes you hate them? Or do you just.... simply prefer letting the car shift for you?
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Imagine you forgot to tighten the bolts and your car becomes two on the highway
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Does Mis Wizard know how to repair cars ???
I know she doesn't know that she knows the best repair tricks ever because she's always in class  she's the best Mr And Mrs Wizard more videos more love"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Anybody remember the old guy who had a desk in the Wizard's office, sold mostly tractors? Hoovie gave him an old Ford years ago. Hope he's okay lol"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Only the wizard could think a water logged xlr is ""pretty cool"""
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Be like Alex on Legit street cars with his Ford Lightning since you're in there you might as well change the fuel pump all the bushings undercoat everything
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Maybe it's just me but I gave up on GM years ago. I would buy new or used GM vehicles and it was like repairing a cheap chain. Fix this and then it's fix that. It seemed it would never end. The one thing I never achieved with GM was the carefree driving that I paid for and never got. There was ALWAYS that little voice in my ear telling me 'Something is going to break and leave you stranded'.  It happened time and time again.  Then I went to Ford, and I was happy for a long, long time. I would take trips in Ford's, from coast to coast, without a hitch. Good luck w/ Ford. No luck/ Bad luck GM? I just had to say goodbye to GM. Now I'm with Toyota/ Lexus/ Hyundai and I haven't spent a nickel on repairs...EVER... and yes, I am an old fart."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"I'm old and remember this level of work was pretty time consuming and involved.  Seems there was always something, even when you tried to think of everything.  Now I'm enjoying the Tesla, 100k miles on it and nothing needed.  Not all new tech is bad."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"the car coming apart and not knowing which part to call the car kinda reminds me of the ship of theseus...



The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment about whether an object that has had all of its original components replaced remains the same object. The question was raised by ancient Greek philosophers: After several centuries of maintenance, if every part of the Ship of Theseus had been replaced, one at a time, was it still the same ship?"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,That hurricane XLR was nothing compared to my '73 Trans Am after Katrina.  It was in my garage in St. Bernard Parish.  Then Rita hit and flooded it all over again.  It was 30 days before we were allowed back in.  The mold was horrific.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Car Wizard will likely lose interest and sell it on the not too distant future. Nice to see his exploration of his various interests and projects.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Can you do a brush pack replacement on the alternator while it's accessible?
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,XLR quad/atv!!! Excellent idea...get a crushed/smashed one!!!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Had the chance to compare the Northstar in a DeVille to the Chevy 350 in a 1995 Buick Roadmaster.  Northstar: twin cam, four valve, looks like a great design on paper.  Antique looking Chevy.  Actual results. Similar power output and acceleration.  Buick always got about 15-20% better gas mileage under same driving conditions.  Just absolutely no reason to have the Northstar even though it looks like it should be a much better engine.  It's just not."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Great video If I can coment I wish you would say is how labor intensive it is and show what happens with ac ps heater ' but good video anyway üëç
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Kind of like jacking up the radiator cap and putting a new car under it!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,The Wizard is now part of the No Muffler Newton Team hahaha üòÇüòÇ
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,The Chrysler 3.6 Makes 300hp. Pretty decent for a V6!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"It's like the old phrase, ""Jack up the radiator cap and drive a new (insert your car here) under it."""
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,66k miles on GM fuel pumps?  My experience with Buicks and pontiacs is that‚Äôs basically end of life.  Along with the alternator and AC system.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Now I am VERY glad I own an EV!  Who the ""A.P. Hill"" would spend that amount of$$$ to retro fit a Caddy?? Just Dumb."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,With the cats so close to the engine on these is there a risk of the engine getting dusted by sucking the dust in when they go bad like on a Nissan 5.6? If so can you get long tubes and b pipes to completely bypass them like the nissan?
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,That liquid cool alternator must be cheaper then hoovies Maybach
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Does it make sense to replace the fuel pumps while everything is down?
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"The XLR was GM's do-over from the failure of the Allante. The XLR is what the Alllante should have been in 1987. It would have been worth every penny of the THEN $58,000 sticker price if it had a bigger, more powerful V8 and RWD. But it debuted with the nightmare HT4100 and only got the very first Northstar in it's last year of production. And it was front wheel drive."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Swapping in a Z06 or C5 Manual transmission would be extremely simple! I feel like a 6spd XLR would be awesome.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Of course, GM could've put fuel-pump access plates in the floor above the tanks, but DUH !!
I seem to recall Wizard adding fuel-pump access to the floor of something recently."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,The XLR is like the SC300 of the Supra...
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"Being from Europe, having driven manuals for 25+ years hearing the Wizard say ""i hate manuals""... Such a sad awakening!"
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Wizzard officially joined the no muffler newton movementüòÖ
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,So that's what GM did with the left over 1961-63 Tempest drivetrains.
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,That car is a mechanics nightmare!
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Tell me again how this was worth the seal job! Lmao
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,Way too complex technology in what is certainly the late internal combustion era. A great opportunity for a master mechanic to solve all those puzzles. Otherwise an opportunity for someone with a whole lot of money to have a very unique automobile experience.

The hottest thing under your hood is the red insulated cable between your starter and your battery. Don't forget to shield it!!!!"

2,jiIaSSwYcp0,"It's a shame GM didn't build these engines like this from the start, with better seals and studs instead of bolts.  These engines had the potential to be amazing engines from the beginning, instead of needing super-expensive refitting later on.  Typical GM cost-cutting -- cutting corners in all the wrong places."
2,jiIaSSwYcp0,That motorcycle c6 build will launch the channel into the stratosphere.

2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I love the testing of worn tires! Anyone can optimize for the testing of brand new tires. What happens when they get worn is the important metric that can rarely get tested
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"The time spent watching this channel is well invested, not wasted!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"As a fan of the Crossclimates I enjoyed this. Currently on the 2 but still have an original from 2016 as my spare and it hasn't cracked and perished. Thanks for trying the budget tyre so I'm not tempted to. Also enjoyed the bit about the environmental impact of tyres although was hoping you would also mention deforestation to grow rubber so it's definitely better, in my opinion, to have to buy them less often and have full life performance."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Surprised how much efficiency was increased with the worn tire. That would explain more of the difference in efficiency loss on my Model 3 going from 2/32 stock tire to 10/32 on the PSAS4. Seems to be 7-10% loss depending on speed.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thank you for this video, I was waiting for it. It seems like a lot of work to do this test.
 What is left in the equation is to live the ""worn"" tires in the sun for a few weeks and then see how they will perform."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great vid, very useful info, thanks üôÇ
This fella has to be one of the best car YouTubers. He knows his subject, articulates his findings enthusiastically and clearly ‚Äì and isn‚Äôt an egotistical bellend, unlike far too many I could mention üôÑ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great vid, thank you!  Quite a few years ago, I shockingly discovered the same thing when I replaced a set of Michelin all seasons that had very little tread remaining with a new set of cheap tires.  Unfortunately, as the cheap tires wore more and were heat cycled, they got even worse (damp/wet roads were a nightmare on the budget tires)."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Can't wait to find out the quality of life a tire has. Most appreciate the effort you and the team's are putting in.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thanks, one of the best tyre reviews over the years I have watched, strong arguments, and I will think twice now about getting new cheap tyres..."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I was going to ask a few days ago if there were any tests on new vs worn tyres. I really like the goodyear 4 seasons after having them a few months, but wondered how they will feel next year with some good amount of wear on them"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great work. Seeing a review done on worn tires, and done well, is valuable to all consumers. Thank you.
My question is how noisy are the CC2 after some wear. The reason I ask is I bought an Audi Q5 with directional ToYo‚Äôs, the stared out fine but with about 20k of wear I thought I had a front bearing going out. They where horrible. Dealer confirmed bearings where good. 
Don‚Äôt want to end up with half worn tires that are just too noisy to leave on the car. Thanks"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I was doing lot of dynamic tyre testing. In my experience all higher price premium tyres had the greatest adventage in consistency during their tyre life. I remember winter continentals with 2 mm still done better than some brand new budget tyres. And budget tyres quickly lost some of their performance when they done some miles.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Another great vid! Thanks!
Regarding the snow handling - some close ups show that the worn CC2 still grabs quite a bit of snow and the area of the tire covered with snow is greater than on the Tomket. So it's the snow gripping to snow, hence better handling (that also proves that CC2 thread design is really awesome) :) If the tire would we warm, straight from the garage on the snowy road, it'd probably skid until it would cool down enough. While cooling, it could cover itself with lots of snow, like a ski with no wax on, when taken from a warm room and put on the snow.
My concern would be more in city snow-salt-sand-mud pulp, where little thread would struggle to push this crap out, as the throughput of these thread 'channels' would be significantly lower. Aquaplanning quite similar, however at higher speed, as water has better density than such winter crap-pulp ;)
Great test, good to know etc. However, I'd still stick to 3-4 mm before the winter for CC2 and then maybe still use it in the summer and get new ones before the next winter, for such conditions, where CC2 is great (mild, mid-European winters with occasional snow and terrible 'love' of the road maintainence  teams to use salt for no good reason on each and every small street in the city... Salt ruins everything (from cars, through clothes to environment, also creating a troublesome waste category) and does not increase road safety at all. Quite the opposite actually, as it makes people drive faster than they would on the compacted snow.
Oh, BTW - yes, I agree that dry grip improves with wear. But (there's always a but ;)) we need to keep againg in mind. 20 y.o. tire may not give us such great grip anymore ;) Yet within 5-8 years I do agree. I had Sportmaxx RT, not used much, after 8 years they were still amazing in the dry, however the thread compound was significantly less elastic than before and in the wet it wasn't the same tire anymore. I've noticed that any sand on the edge of the road was also a bigger challenge compared to the same tire a year earlier, with pretty much the same thread depth (really not used much - it had almost 6 mm when I left them for recycling, after 8 seasons). I had the same observations with bicycle tires. With age they still grip in the try, but any surface imperfections, sand and dust on the road becomes more challenging. Wet becomes a disaster. As with car tyres :)"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thank you very much for this great comparison! üëç
If you find the time, could you test the effect of the tirepressure as well? I learned many years ago to drive with less pressure in slippery condition and lately I read a recommendation of giving more pressure in the tire to have more grip! Is this perhaps meant if you are going to drive fast or is it even better for traction when you get stuck? I didn't find anything about this subject yet!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Michelin's tyre is known for consistent performance throughout its lifetime. I've heard Kumho is notorius for performance degredation as it gets worn. It is very difficult to execute, but I would love to see a normal multi-factor tyre comparison between makes and models with worn tyres."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"great to see the Crossclimate results, I have 3mm on my CC tyres, am wondering whether I will see some snow in Kent this month, these test results convince me to continue to use these tyres and not to replace until tread depth is lower."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Very interesting test, I did not expect that the worn ones brake so well on snow. Thanks."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Love the videos mate, could you go on more about tyres like this? Or better yet, have a test for worst tyre of the year. Bring out the ling longs and fuzions!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thank you for this, I know I've asked on a few of your videos about testing worn tyres as new tyres can differ significantly when worn."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great to know I picked well with the crossclimate 2's and they will last and perform for a long time. Sounds like we'll potentially have a lot of snow in the UK for the first time since I got them, so will soon find out"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I've been through several all-weather high mileage years with original CC, CC+ and now have 18,000 miles on CC2. They've been excellent and the CC2 seems the best yet in the dry and wet - no snow usage yet, but that will come in the next few months. Very happy with these so far, and this was a particularly reassuring test for me to see. Based on wear so far it looks like my fronts will be used up at about 35K miles (180 hp Corolla hybrid) and the rears are showing only 0.5 mm wear after 18K. So those will get cycled to the front probably this time next year, and I will get new rears."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I had a set of 1st gen. Cross Climates. I thought they were awesome and when they were getting old, I replaced them with the Cross Climate II's. These were both on a Scion XA. The II's seem to be wearing better and better in the dry, wet and snow. Over 200,000 on the Scion, going for 3. Definitely will be reshodding with the II's unless a III becomes available."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Fantastic - very informative.  No, even if you replaced your budget tyres annually when only half worn they still wouldn't out perform a premium tyre in the wet, even in the premium tyre's 2nd year and final half of its life, as it were.  Always wondered if there would be a crossover Tread depth (say 4.5mm) for new budget vs older premium, like the temperature crossover for winter vs summer tyres at 8 degC!  Thanks for all your great work and enthusiasm üëç üòÄ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,You forget the one big thing - worn tires are usually old and the rubber is hard. For winter tires it's a huge deal because the softer the tire the better. That's why a cheaper newer tire is almost always a better option.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Not all budget tires are equal in order to put them in the same category. Try a comparison between the Michelin Crossclimate 2 and a Kormoran/Tigar/Riken All Season or between the Goodyear Vector 4Seasons Gen3 and a Sava All Weather. New, worn, combined, etc."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,As a guy who works with tyres I love this channel haha I'd be interested to see this same test with summer tyres as so many people have summer tyres all year round so the wet test would be interesting
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Kudos for your in-deep review and proving many of my points. 
A good tire is always good tyre and it is sometimes even better when near its lifetime."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Another great video. Thanks for all the info. I recently bought Pirelli Ice Zero. Very soft and quiet tires. Feels like Ia m floating on the road. The grip on ice isn't bad either.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thanks for another great review. 

I have just bought the CC2's for my wife's Toyota Venza, FWD. We live in Calgary, Canada where we see extreme temperatures, so we'll see how they perform, which should be very good based on all the reviews I have watched. 

I have Conti Extreme Contacts on my GT Mustang that I drive in the winter. These tires have a pretty good grip, but you still have to be careful with ice as opposed to fresh snow. In the wet and dry they are excellent. 

I also have Conti True Contacts on my 2007 Hyundai Sonata (v6, the car for the dogs and hail storms).  They perform really good in all conditions but wear quicker than other tires I have had, the cold weather trade off is worth it for me.  I shall probably be adding CC2's to my cars when it is time. 

Your videos are very informative. Thx"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Again thank you for developing this channel and making your testing results available for our benefit.
Extremely valuable information"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I never buy budget so am interested in comparison between premium and mid range tyre.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"This is interesting. I remember watching an old racing documentary where the specific team knew how much the tires would wear during the race so they would shave them down by machine until they were at the point there would be not much wear life by the end of the race. I assumed this was a rotational mass thing, and smaller diameter meaning more torque to accelerate out of the corners. Never occurred to me there'd be much of a traction advantage to it."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I've used the Michelin North4  studded  for now into 3 seasons ( roughly 20-25 000 km ) on my daily driver in Manitoba Canada . It's at around 5/32s and still excellent grip so far. I have always had snow tires and could feel the loss of traction as they wore down.  These North 4's  ( with the help of 85% of the studs left) have not changed to the point of noticing loss of grip.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Your work is appreciated! Also the result of the test is astonishing. I'm currently considering this tyre for my subaru outback. The other tyre I'm looking at is hankok 4s2 because it's a bit cheaper
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Outstanding episode üëç I've been waiting for a while to see a review like this. CrossClimate2 tires are my next buy so this was a very timely video.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great review, seems that money for premium tyres is money well spent, especially on the long run."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Great effort üëç love watching your tests.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"There's another speculation going on that when it's 6 degrees C or lower then winter tires are already performing better on dry & wet tarmac. Pikes or no pikes. This is a test I've never found. ;) Maybe I can find it here... 

Many drive with summer tires until the very last moment where tarmac & outside temperatures are around 1-3 degrees. I guess all seasons would be the winners here."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Brilliant idea! Thank you for this test.

I'd also like to see how other tyres perform when they're used...
Hopefully the Goodyear will be on the list."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Thank you for all these tests!!! You‚Äôre doing a great job!üëçüí™
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Very very interesting tests you performed here. Thank you for that. 
Can you please tell us the speeds from which you did the brake tests? That would be very helpful. Thanks"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I have had these CrossClimate2 tires in SWFL rainy seasons as well as driving up to the NC Mountains during snow events.  They are no joke.  And on 2 different vehicles.  Will definitely continue to purchase these tires.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"i'm impressed and happy with how well the worn CC2 tires worked.  they're reinforcing my desire to buy these tires next time we need new ones.  I'm really NOT liking the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady's I fitted 2 years ago.  I've said it before but they're such a massive downgrade from the older, now discontinued, TripleTreads.  I honestly think even the OE RS-A's are a better tire.

the answer as to why the worn michelins were better in snow, was clear from the camera footage: they were holding on to the snow better in the treads.  snow grips snow.

great test though."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Honestly I thought just how many things can you do with a tyre and how many different tests can you run where the results are important and surprising.....Well this guy don't disappoint.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"The good news, the tomket didn't take you for an unplanned route to an alternative circuit this time. Great review many thanks !!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Fantastic test.  I will admit I am quite surprised that worn out premium tire performed so well.  It is a clear testament that engineering and quality of compound goes way beyond just depth of the tire grooves and surface.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I was mind-blown to see the worn tires perform BETTER in dry conditions. I guess that's one of the reasons why slick tires are so grippy.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Thanks for your thorough research. You're becoming an institution of tyre reviews
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"This channel has officially turn me into a tyre junkie.  And I love it.  
First video to watch on a Sunday morning üòÖ before coffee no less üòÇ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I bought the original CC tires back a few yers ago. I LOVED them! I now have the cross climate 2s on my other car.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thanks for producing this kind of tests. üëç This aspect has been in my head for some time and I have been among the people who asked you to try to do it, really interesting to see the results. So thanks also for listening to your ""fan club"". üôèüòÑ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great video. Based on this channel, I bought a set of cross climate 2s a few weeks ago for a winter set in NJ. I fitted to Tesla model 3P. So far feel great, albeit not as precise feeling as the summers that come with the model 3."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Much respect for pointing out the environmental impacts üëç
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great video as always! For the upcoming summer season could you do a test comparison of how different rim widths affect the performance of a tyre while keeping tyre width the same? Ideally a 255. BMW runs a 255 on a 8.5 on the rear, but I wonder how the steering response/grip would be affected on 8.5/9/9.5 wheel widths."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"ive experienced good tires vs cheapos in the wet first hand. i once had a set of primewell 830s on my miata. they were fine, but one day i got a few nails in two of them and replaced just the two with a pair of firestone fuel fighters. i put the new firstones on the front. in the dry nothing really changed, the grip was about the same. but in the wet it was a different story. not raining hard, not standing water, but damp surface. i left the house, turned onto the 270 degree highway on-ramp to go to work and drifted nearly the whole damn thing, not even trying. the primewells were SO shit in the wet that the rear of the car couldnt keep up with the front and it slid SO easy haha."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Such an interesting test, thank you for the always excellent content! üëç"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"My Bridgestone all-weather are supposed to have the ""wear to the wear bars"" without losing the pattern or substantial loss of grip."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great video proving once again that, most times, you do get what you pay for."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,@tyrereviews Thank you!! This is exactly the video I was waiting for. I hope you get the budget to do more worn tire videos
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,one year as it became winter and the snow started falling I went for a drive on the local snowmobile trails on an island with my civic that had pretty much bald front tires and I was going through snow drifts and didn't get stuck once; yet the following week after putting on brand new premium tires I went for another drive on the same trails in the same snow drifts and got stuck almost immediately because the tires bit into the snow drifts too much...  just some food for thought...
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I've bought Crossclimate 2 for my dads car. I was suprised by 2 facts. 
1) In 215/45 R16 it doesn't have rim protector lip. I've never seen any other tire in that size without it. 
2) Thread depth is only 7.6 mm so it has only 3.6 mm of usable rubber (legal winter limit is 4 mm)."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Basically you've shown that: 
- thread doesn't matter as much
- as a consequence, a better tyre remains a better tyre, mainly (probably) because of the compound.
As some have mentioned, the drying of the tyres is an important factor, you can hear it through NVH as the years go on even if you don't drive the car much, and just by touch, you feel the tyre is chemically less sticky. For a winter biased tyre that is using that stickiness to grip, it's a deal breaker."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"i came to realise this years ago. i had a  2001 mercedes E430,  put 4 brand new cheaper tyres on, the car was awful in the wet and they wore out in about 15000 miles. found a set of part worn P-zeros for ¬£150 fitted (less then the new budget tyres. and dry and wet grip was much much better and they lasted longer then the cheap tyres."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,You sir are a legend. Thank you for everything!
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"This is one of the arguments used by adopters of budget tires (which I was until recently), to say: ""Instead of driving for three years on used tire, I can buy three sets of budget tires and drive every year on new tire."" Which you never do! :D You'd still run it to the bare minimum for the same three years. You just don't want or don't have money to spend on premium tire, but if you can and you try it once, you really feel the difference. Or you think that you feel the difference :)
And it was @tyrereviews that made me switch my habit and go for premium this year."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Thank you so much for making this video.  I have not really thought about what would be like once my CC2 wears down; however, this video really helps.  It is increasable to see that a set of premium tires could still outperform a set of new budget tires.  Is there a comparison review on worn down CC2 vs X-Ice Snow??!!üòâ Ultimate winter showdown!!üòâ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great Review thanks you for explaining everything in details!

 So far I'm very happy with my CrossClimate 2 purchase. The Performance has been great overall on the Snow, Rain and Dry conditions.¬†

I also want to mention the tire does a great job making the drive quality a lot more smoother and stable. I take many road trips throughout the year and so far driving 4 - 8 hours has been great! I highly recommend the CrossClimate 2's to everyone and anyone that is looking to buy a new tire."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Tyres are so important, especially here in the UK and Ireland. Budgets tyres are downright dangerous for two thirds of the year"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,After just 2 years on Mediterranean ‚òÄÔ∏è every tire becomes significantly closer to plastic than new... So i think these is only relevant in aquaplaning. With regards!
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great test (as usual!), but one note though - it is not always only about thread depth. I have had tyres which were fine for their depth, but the compound got degraded after 4-5 years (yes, I don't drive like mad when not driving my M240i). So last tyres I had to change  were changed due to the compound degradation, not due to the thread depth. So having 4-5 years old tyre with low thread is not the same as having the ""new"" (relatively) tyre machined down to the same thread height. This is not a critisim, just my observation. Thanks for the review!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I read somewhere that, Michelin's claim was to be the best tire when the tire is worn out."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Well done for this kind of test.  Worn tyres are all tyres after 10.000km ....   much more interesting than the new ones.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Thank you for your great videos! I work in sales for a tyre dealer. Some people just won‚Äôt accept good advice. I often refer to your channel when people think I‚Äôm just trying to sell higher priced tyres.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I love my crossclimates, mainly because of how quiet they are. Saying that I'm convinced the 2 isn't as quiet as the +"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Good video. Lots of good information. Just put on the Cross Climate 2 on my wife's 2018 Subaru Crosstrek 4 months ago, that tire is performing as advertised and better than I expected. There has been no snow in my neck of the woods (Eastern Virginia) so I cannot comment on that yet."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I feel like we're getting the same level of performance data that the tire engineers themselves are working with.  Very cool!  (Well, maybe a bit less math here, which is fine with me!)"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Wouldn't have either... kumho solus 4sha32 ""I have on now"", nankang aw6 ""I've had"" or uni uniroyal rain  sports 3 all day long, if it's the odd snow day. Used the Michelin on my company car and got stuck multiple times, so never again for me."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"This has made me reconsider whether I should replace Michelin PS 4 with less than 15k ""daily / street"" miles but five years old. Does age still trump everything else? The usual consummate tyre test, thanks for all your work."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Impressive by michellin, I wonder if other brands would up as well."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Could someone test ice braking of 3 year old used winter tires, studded vs studless. The theory is that studs drop in performance really fast. I would like to see how a budget studless fares at 3 years against the top performance studded tire at 3 years of use. On ice. That would be awesome."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Interesting that the budget tires are almost a splitting image of the Nokian WRG4. It would be interesting if how this clone would do against the WRG4 in a head-to-head.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Thanks for doing this test. Love to see these!
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Great video! nice results, proves Michelin's statements of tyre wear life. Quite surprising snow performance. Actually for reasons of grip in the snow (and mostly peace of mind) I swapped my CrossClimate+ with new CrossClimate2 in January, this somehow proves I was maybe a little hasty, subjectively üòÄ.
I almost feel bad for swapping my CC+ with brand new CC2 before the spring and not enjoying better grip in the summer üòÖ (for the sake of the worness test, the CC+ I runned for 65.5k. km / 41k. miles and were still performing).
Thank for answering also my question last July to a clip on the new CC2, when a test on worn CC will be doneüòâ."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I would bet that the performance of the used cross would be far away than the budget tyre!!!
Didn't see that coming!
Thank you very much once again!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Can you repeat this test with summer tires?
Touring, HP, UHP, etc‚Ä¶"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,Insane Michelin performance with 2mm of trear!  How do they do it?  They MUST be the best tire company in the world.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Once again, if you need a tire that does everything, get crossclimate, done üòÅ"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I`m leaving this here, maybe someone can help with similar experience.
I run CC+ 185/65/R15 DOT2017 but fitted on the car in Nov 2018. Last winter, the fourth on the car, the fifth from manufacturing, I started to feel some kind of micro-slip when cornering on dump weather and worn roadsurface,  with outside temp over 0 C (never on highways). It feel like they slip for an instance, then, when I expect to loose control, the car balances itself (I have no traction control) and everything is normal again. It`s random, not every corner, maybe 2-3 times in 200km, enough to scare me for the remaining part of the trip. I also read that others experienced this feeling of micro-slipping with CC2."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"And yet the MOT only looks at the treat depth... i'm saying for a years a worn ps4 drives better in the rain than a new budget one. Only with extremely deep water you start to get skating, however, if thats the case you should not be driving 60+..."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"One very important thing wasn't in this test is rubber detoriation. As the car stays outside, tires gets sunlight, go between high and cold temperatures, become wet and dry and so become harder and brittle. Hardened rubber loses it's traction noticeably. That michelin tire must have done that 4000 miles in a controlled specific setup, because the rubber looks like new, soft and plush, still have the hairs on it's side. So that's not really a worn out tire. Thus I say this test doesn't reflect the real life experience much."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I thought there would be a massive dropoff in performance except for the dry, good to know premium tires still mostly maintain performance even at low tread. You should do a worn winter tire vs new winter tire test, and include budget options as well, as buying used winter sets is fairly common to save money."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"I really don't know how to praise you friend. Your videos are really great, especially the ones that go in the form of controlled experiments. Please continue this."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,If you remember I asked for this some years ago and I am very very glad you are doing this. Waiting for the other video you said it should be coming soon where you compare all premium brands for wear vs performance.
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Love this channel, just fitted the Cross climates to my cx30 üëå"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,I have this tire and it's been the best I've had in 20 yrs
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"Please plan to do a full episode on the test tracks, how they work, what it takes to maintain and prepare them for these reviews, behind the scenes crew members... etc... would love to see that!"
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"This worn test sounds so good. I compared Michelin X-ice 3 and Blizzaks in my cars and I can see sipes are visible till illegal tire depth in Xice while Blizzaks lose them way way sooner. And although performance were pretty much the same for both (excellent in snow), Blizzaks were getting really hard to drive in RWD car after 3 seasons (without America beloved tire rotation). I saw that in my car and my buddy's car. It seems like Michelin's ""total life performance"" might be not just marketing BS."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"What about budget dedicated winter tyres vs high end all season (CC2)? Otherwise great work, big thank you for the effort."
2,PXOE1DpjQGg,"To say it's an impressive performance is to damn Michelin with faint praise, as it's a genuinely stunning outcome.  I won't challenge your ranking among tire geeks, but friends have expressed concern about my affinity for the aroma of new tires.  üòÇ"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"You should do more of these flip projects. In the late '90s, my grandparents' house on Christmas Day would look like a Mondeo dealership, so many of my family had one back in the day. It's good to see that this car's bumpers have stood up to time quite excellently."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"One bit of advice Matt before you get too much further involved,take a power feed to the fuel pump connection at the tank and make certain that it's not seized with stale fuel.also you can check for delivery pressure on the fuel rail at the valve on the left hand side good luck."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,I would have cleaned it first as it makes any further work more pleasant and will help to get it sold whatever you do. Immobilisers are a real pain. I scrapped my Vauxhall Combo van because the immobiliser was preventing it from starting.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Love these kind of videos, keep them up!

I just picked up a 67k mile 57 plate Hyundai Coupe 2.0 Auto for ¬£250, underneath the growth from being sat it was actually a really nice car. After 3 new calipers, new brakes all round, a new cambelt and a service, it passed its MOT and sold for ¬£2495!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Could be an interesting series Matt, looking forward to more in the series. I suspect Mrs Furious is not going to be happy you caked the front of the house and windows with Mondeo gunk‚Ä¶2 demerit points. But if you get it up and running and for sale, bonus points!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Great idea, Matt, very exciting! I think you should do this more often üòÉüëèüèº"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"This promises to be a great little series, I've been itching to do something like this for ages! There's a Volvo 240 that's been sitting around my way but no idea who the property belongs to."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Love this Matt, hope you can flip it for a nice little profit! I used to do this a lot 15 years ago, but I always walked away from cars that sat for years on end in the elements or a draughty shack because of mice and rats. They destroy everything. Was always fun to do, cleaning it, servicing it and sell for a little profit. Saving another car from the scrapper!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I bought a 1996 mk1 Mondeo ghia which sat 16 years last summer  . I serviced it and just put in a new pump and fuel filter and it fired up quite happily . it‚Äôs amazing how much stale fuel can damage and seize everything up . 
I would also consider clay baring the car before machine polishing to get rid of remaining surface contamination on the paint so you don‚Äôt drag it in your buffing pad . 
Keep up the good work . Nice too see another early Mondeo on the mend üëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Looks like there‚Äôs a nice-looking Mondeo under all that compost. Best of luck! It deserves another chance. We owned a similar one back in the day (called the Contour here in the States), and while it had its share of problems it was a nice car to drive, with the V6. I think my wife still misses it."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Like MrCoggins Garage mentions, you can check for fuel pressure on the fuel rail. There is a schrader valve just to the left of the throttle cable. You should get a good squirt of fuel out of it when you press it in. This car is going to be interesting for me because my daily driver is a 1997 MK2 Mondeo 2.0. You can still access the fuel cap release cable, but you have to pull back the boot liner to get at it. I am keeping my fingers crossed for you when it comes to the normal rusting out spots - sills etc, especially near the rear arches. Hopefully the previous owner had them injected with waxoyl. Hoping you can save her Matt, the MK2 Mondeo's are becoming rather rare now on the roads."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,I think siphoning out at least some of the old fuel before adding new would have been a good move.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"THIS is the content I love! 
Great Matt, I'm glad to see you in these ""flipping"" adventures!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Really appreciate the varied content and new ideas, always good to shake things up! I love the quick flip plan, forces you to think on your feet and be flexible, to deal with whatever the car throws at you. The beauty of it is you could do it 10 times with the same age make/model and get 10 different outcomes! Possibly don't tell Mrs Furious that though... üòÅ"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Matt
Truly a fantastic video & something completely different from what you normally do. It‚Äôs sounds like the immobiliser isn‚Äôt allowing to start. Love to see further updates on this one"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I love these rescue videos. The Fiesta one you did a couple of years ago was a good one too, but more straightforward"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Absolutely deserves saving, I can't remember the last time I saw an early Mondeo on the road, look forward to seeing how it goes."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,What a treat!  Matt you do these extremely well so looking forward to this series.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Love to see the appreciation for an old mondeo. My dad had one a few years ago and it was Lovley, such a shame though that there‚Äôs so little left on the road"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Thank you Matt, best video I've seen on the Tube for a while. I laughed at the testing of the rear suspension  and Mrs Furious giving you a week. I'm rooting for you to turn it around, save a car and make a profit."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"My first ‚Äúbig car‚Äù in the shade of marine blue! Got it with 80k on it, kept it until 260k‚Ä¶ just regular servicing, nothing went wrong with it‚Ä¶ although the bumper plastics were made from the thinnest brittlest plastic known to man!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,So happy this video has been a success üëçüèª good on you for always switching things up on the channel and fair play for all the outside graft.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Poor old thing, I was mixed feeling of this generation of Mondeo, as 3 Gen Mondeo owner these old ones have grown on me, be interesting see how this one pans out, hope mrs furious is not too furious about this vehicle üòÖ"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Really like the variety you've always involved on your channel. 
Love dragging a car back that's been ignored for years, and turning it into something useable. Perfect recycling üëç
BTW, G101 would have pulled that sap and moss out with very little effort. Swear by the stuff"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,This car is covered in MOSS SECURITY lol. üòÇ. These were great cars so can‚Äôt wait to see it cleaned up Matt. üëçüèªüëçüèª
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Really enjoyed that one, thanks, nice to see one of those Mondeos coming back, even all these years later, still think they are a good looking car."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Matt, great challenge. Just one thought, using your logic that the security system was triggered by the open bonnet, surely it would be the same with the open driver's door. You may need to mask up and get in the car to start it."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"A great video Matt, always nice to see a modern classic being revived and brought back to life. I love detailing on a car including my own. Hoping the next episode, it will fire up!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Awesome, Matt! I love this idea! Even if you get it started and looking fairly decent, it gives someone the impetus to take it further, maybe? Can't wait for the next one üëçüèª"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Brilliant Mat,üòä I have just saved a 1998 white 2.0LX manual saloon one that has come up in  mint condition, So I am loving this one!,üëçüëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Great idea and it'll be an interesting series.  Might be worth changing the oil even if not the filter as it'll have degraded since being put in.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Investing in a couple of proper Jerry cans and a draining pump (oil draining pump from Lidl works for me) is useful as a way of getting equipped to pull fuel out of vehicles.
In fact the last time I wanted to get the diesel out of a car I just pulled a pipe under the bonnet and it pushed the fuel out using its own pump."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Best thing I‚Äôve used on moss etc after snow foam before going back to pressure washer is meguiars wash plus, bang it straight onto the mitt and scrub away, absolutely brilliant stuff üëçüèªüëçüèª then obviously get the clay bar out üòÖ

Love this new element to the channel though Matt, would definitely like to see more of this sort of flip project kind of thing üëçüèªüëçüèª"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Certainly brings a new meaning to ecological friendly cars, Ford were ahead of the game in 1998 with this very organic car! Immoilizers on ""future"" classics are going to prove troublesome particularly third party ones - where are the manuals, instructions and knowledge to operate them or strip them out. Great video!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Great video, I do like those old Mondeos, I‚Äôm looking forward to the next instalment on this car, I really enjoyed watching üòä."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Good video, Interesting what cars people have hidden away, you never see those old mondeos anymore!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Great video, love the bring back to life videos, please keep this one going"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"These are lovely cars and well worth saving. Hopefully it's not got the standard Mondeo fault of vague steering and pulling to one side - I once had a P-reg 2.0 LX which did that, and I never got round to fixing it. Also the self-destructing heater blower wiring, although I did fix that as I couldn't stand it only working on maximum speed."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Is definitely be changing that oil! Oil is hydroscopic and if it's been sat for a long period of time, it won't be a quality grade anymore.

Excited to see this transform! üëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Had a 1.8 Zetec V reg in this shape and loved it! Went miles and miles. Such a good car in their day.  Good
Luck with it. üëçüèº"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Are you actively trying to get Mrs Furious to leave you? üòÇ
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Some negotiation skills that Matt.  From ""no"" to ""you've got a week"" üëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,I would recommend taking a look underneath for rust and the condition of the running gear before investing any more time into this one! üòÑ
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Loving the content Matt! Keep it coming :)
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,This is great content - more of this please!
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I really hope you make it to get it back on road or road like condition to sell!

Either way look forward to see how you go!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"These are the sort of videos I like to see, keep up the good work üëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Love this video, as I'm a big fan of Mondeos.  Mk2s are getting rare now.  Potential classic car there.  I've commented more on part 2.  Cheers.  Vivian"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I had that engine in my T-reg Focus and what a fantastic engine it really is! Very lively and torquey unit and simple to fix. When did you see a Mk3 Mondeo let alone one of these MK2s! What a lovely car indeed, love these quick flips! Great video Matt"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Love these type of videos. Hope you can get it running seems a nice car and needs to be back on the road.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Lovely to see a mk2 mondeo once everywhere on the road and now so rare well done Matt that‚Äôs quite a challenge but looks like it‚Äôs a nice car I bet as an arriva car I bet most of them were motorway miles looks like a Manchester car originally with that number 
I bet Mrs furious face was a picture lol but I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this one come off
Great to see Matt and great save hopefully it will go to a good home"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Lovely save Matt, these Mondeos are very dear to my heart as I grew up with one in the family for many years. What‚Äôs happening with the immobiliser? Is it a solid red light on the dashboard?"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Love it. Don't do a quick flip, do some more in depth videos of the car. Really enjoyed this episode"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Great idea for video Matt...always good to do something different.  Look forward to part 2
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Also,  to see if there is fuel preasure from the tank to the fuel rail,  you simply take the plastic dust cover off the shrader valve located on the fuel rail and depress the pin,  if fuel sprays out this means your fuel pump is working and you have fuel being delivered to the engine,  if no fuel sprays out this means your fuel pump isn't working,

On the mondeo,  the imobilizer shuts power to the fuel pump in the tank and stops the starter motor from spinning,  the fact the starter motor is spinning tells me your imobilizer has deactived and permission to start has been granted by the ecu"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I am expecting STIRLING work on this MOSS car Matt , do you see what I did then üòÇ, wow üòÆeven made myself chuckle at that line üòÅ."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,I'm amazed for a 24 year old Ford it's got no rot ! - I recon it will clean up well as it looks presentable - Best of luck !
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Have to say you have nailed being a youtuber the content is  varied and interesting. More of the same we don't know what wel see next from 60s classics to everyday cars.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"When they were new I seem to remember that if the car didn't start they needed to be locked and unlocked on the key fob. Simply putting the key in door lock doesn't always turn off the imobiliser. 
You also need to make sure the system is programmed to the red key or it won't start or turn over. 
This tech is old hat now so hopefully your expert will sort quickly."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,love the videos keep up the good work hopefully you do get her going I think the mondeo is such an underrated car
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Matt brilliant I needed a good laugh..quote..under the bonnet cleaning,‚Äùso disgusting or alternatively make good top soil‚Äù.love it..can‚Äôt wait to see the next instalment üòä"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,These zetecs seem very sensitive to old fuel. I had a full tank of fuel in my focus that was less than a year old and the car flat out would not start. Drained the entire tank and it fired up first time with fresh fuel
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"The company where I was working in 1998 bought an S-reg estate version of this Mondeo for our new Pool Car. It had the most uncomfortable cars seats I have ever sat on, which for a rep's car was a big bad surprise.  Good luck with the ""restoration"" !"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Wow! Great video!  And I admire your enthusiasm to fix old car's.  I've never owned a mondeo but but do think there good car's üëç
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Thoroughly enjoyed this video! More of this, please"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Be great to see you work your magic and save it from the scrap man - looking forward to the next instalment üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Fantastic Matt. Hope you get the Mondeo running and sold for quite a bit. But you may want to keep it and use it yourself? I have a soft spot for Fords and it would be nice for the Crown Vic to have a sibling like the Rovers do!
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Best looking version of the Mondeo, well done so far!!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Fair play to you.
I worked at FORD when the Mondeo was launched,never expected them mk1's would be of any interest . . . HOWEVER.  . . The Garage industry is suffering badly because of people like yourself,who are taking business away from us by doing 'what you do' . . . The internet has opened up a massive can of worms for us,and many other industries . . Too many 'barn find specialists' have grown from nothing and have thinned out Garages,Workshops and 'recommisioning' for us is now in decline.
Sad truths . . . I'm a really good Brick Layer,but I don't do any,because it isn't my industry . . Rising costs of our Recovery Trucks and Equipment,being squeezed to death thinner and thinner. . . But, Youtube 'fitters' keep being born don't they . . . 
Joke it isn't . . ."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Excellent video, I love these cars and its cool to see one saved from the scrap man."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"This is going to sound weird but I have always loved the Mondeo since I was 14, despite the fact we never got these in the US. Even though we had the Contour and Mystique, the mk1 hatch Mondeo was always a car I wanted. I have looked for a clean MK1 to bring to the US but as I own 11 restored cars in the fleet, it‚Äôs hard to justify. That and it would need to be California Smog retrofit unless I locate a diesel? Hmmm‚Ä¶."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Love these videos you do. Keep them up! X
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I liked the new edge styling on 90s fords and the Mondeo was the nicest. I wonder if the immobiliser had a remote rob which unlocked the car and deactivated the immobiliser at the same time, had a transit with similar system, it was a Toad"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,This makes great contentüëç Admire your enthusiasm and principle behind this but I do worry this could just be a complete pain in the ...... for you. I hope I‚Äôm wrong üòÄ
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"One week's time: ""Hmm... I quite like this, now. I'm not sure I want to let it go."" Prophetic words? We shall see! üòÅüëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,What a good idea. Save a mk2 Mondeo which is a rare breed in itself these days and pour profits into the other projects. I really hope it is the immobiliser and it can be overcome. Hope this does turn out ok without too much expense.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,cleaning starts around 20:00
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I'm looking forward to the next episode, great stuff, Matt"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I liked that generation of Mondeo.  We had a silver Aspen Diesel, I got it cheap after a chance meeting with a lady at a kids birthday party.  Although I had to go to the company's offices with a bankers draft, ¬£3,500 and it was three years old, bargain!  Kept it for another eight....Matt, you should do some more flipping as it makes for exiting and interesting viewing."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,It's sparking because it fired on the starter fluid. Temporary rig a power supply to the fuel pump and give it another go. Immobiliser from this era is easy to remove. Follow the wires and disconnect live and earth and reconnect the circuits which have been bridged by the immobiliser unit.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I've got a thing for mk 1 and 2 mondeo's I've  had a few of both, hard to kill them zetec engines, keep up the good work, cracking vid üëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Good project, looking forward to following this all week. So much plant residue on that car you could have done an article for ""Gardeners World""."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Great project! This is the kind of content I like.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Brilliant video Matt. Just the kind of subject that makes your channel a must see.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Great video Matt. It was such a relief when you starting washing it. üòÖ I don‚Äôt think we would see this Mondeo for sale at Stone Cold Classics!
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,This is cool.  Will the mouldeo (see what I did there?) run?  Fun and games for all.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,This proves the point that at any time a man can suddenly lose his sanity! You are a brave man Mat!
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Do you know what I do before flattening an endless sucession of batteries? I check for a spark and that fuel is actually being delivered to the carburetor or injection system. Pulling the fuel hose  in the engine bay and testing for fuel delivery allows you to flush the most degraded fuel out at the very least. Checking for fuel before and after any filter is a good idea. 

A fuel injected car will prime the fuel system for 30 seconds or so, so you can check for pump operation without ever having to crank. My Mondeo would occasionally fail to prime and require the ignition to be turned off for several minutes to reset. 

Once you are sure you're getting fuel through, an effective trick for stale fuel is to remove the plugs and get them good an hot, so hot you need gloves to put them back in. I've started cars with decade old fuel that way."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Luvin yer optimism Auld Stockin, The big thing with that is going to be when you get it up in the air. Rust used to be a bugger with those things. Parts were usually plentiful.I think that you are on the right track with the immobiliser.."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,There is a guy near me who drives a silver one of these around - it‚Äôs mint and he ALWAYS has leather driving gloves on. The man is a boss.
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Matt would love to see more of this on the channel!
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"A great video , a big fan of the Ford Mondeo back in the day so great to see one on your channel üëçüëçüëç"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,Great cars! i would be very interested in his car as I have been looking for a MK2 project as they are geeting rarer now . What would a car like this go for?
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Hi matt, i am just wondering how much an oil change and an air fliter might cost? In my country it would cost around 50$ so i think you should change them on the ford then add them to the final price."
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Excellent idea Matt, about time you had a project car to play with. ;-)"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"If the drivers door key switch is acting up, it might not be disabling the alarm/immobilizer
... try disarming or unlocking from the passenger door"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I had a immobilser issue with my old 306, it caused a non start in so many situations. Locking it and leaving it 10 minutes then unlocking it would sort it., But not always... Always with checking with these old cars and keycodes etc. Sometimes the chip in the key would also go weird"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"Good on you for trying to save this they was a good car to drive , with the fuel you don't need v power any petrol will do but when it's sat for so long would always drain it for fresh as will block lines up"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"I feel your pain.
My Ranger pickup was been under a tree where the leaves settled in the plastic lined bed to rot. It had only been a few months, the odor and mess was horrific and vile!"
2,DJn-vR_AMSw,"The issue is the immobiliser, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about removing the fuel unless you can use it in another petrol daily driver‚Ä¶"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Definitely made the right move going to the Longhorn
2,OYjOC59lEzs,I heard HTF and Joseph Joiner‚Äôs name mentioned several times on the radio and even by YT broadcasters covering the weeks racing on a national level. HTF is getting racing coverage on a national level which will have many new sponsors looking to spend their money for next two seasons of racing. Good Luck HTF. Great racing to Joseph and Jesse.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Crew gets the game ball üèà. AWESOME JOB
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Man ,congratulations guys! Y‚Äôall did an awesome job! Merry Christmas to you all and a Happy New Year as well! I can‚Äôt wait to see HTF plans for 2023!"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Really Like Capital. But I think Longhorn is the best move for y'all progression. 2023 is gonna be awesome.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Couldn‚Äôt be more prouder of my favorite racing team!!!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,That Drame has certainly proved itself.  It's pushed you boys a LOT of laps and great finishes.  Great job guys!!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Damn what a finish for Jospeh! Jessie has gained seat time and I‚Äôm sure that will help him going into the 2023 race season. As always another good one fellas üèÅü§òüèº
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"JD with the ""Where did you come from?"" line üòÇ. Great moment to catch on camera. That scramble feeling is the worst. When something is broke and you don't have time to fix it. It's the only time in life where you feel like you hopped in a time machine to a few hours later with no idea how you got there. Bet the crew felt like that. Big season, this Longhorn is killer at podiums, good things coming."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"I was aware of the results before watching the video and I kept thinking ""how the heck is he getting up to 3rd""?  Great runs over the week-end and it all bodes well for HTF in 2023.  Congrats also to Jesse for all he did in making both races which is a feat in itself!"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Been a great year thank y‚Äôall for all the entertainment. God bless hunt the front.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Loving every race..  Let's go!!!  Team Jesus!!!  üòò
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"That was one piece of driving there JJ, good job on the camera following his come back, that longhorn is prayers answered."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"I love that never quit attitude from you guys, nice job jarred repairing the power steering line. All of your crew did a awesome job EVERYONE, that's what make a great team. What a great drive by Joseph and Jessi. Great job. Congrats on a good year,  can't wait until next year, your going to have a GREAT year. Love the fact superman asked where you came from that's awesome. As always go get em htf. Have a great and blessed off season."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Is it just me or is Joseph just smooth with the steering. Always looks like he is just out for a little drive on a Sunday morning. Good job guys.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Got that longhorn rolling one of the best decisions the team made, Congrats HTF and Jesse for making both shows"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,have to comment on Jesse what a great attitude he has whether he's struggling or not. gatta love it. üíØüëç
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great job guys Joseph driving the wheels off that thing and Jessie good job also and to the crew for putting in that work üèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅ
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Congratulations on your third place finish, fantastic job. I thought Fridays race was exhausting but this nights racing was exhausting. Way to go Jesse you made the Show both nights and finished, good going. A big and loud applause for tonight‚Äôs Hunt The Front Crew you were awesome."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Congratulations Joseph, that was getting it done. Never give up attitude. Jesse great run. Thanks for sharing your videos with us this year. Have a great off season, and Merry Christmas to all the HTF members and your families."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Must be doing something right if Overton is asking for advice‚Ä¶
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Holy chute
Joseph, you nailed it figured this season  out. Big time.
Real dang proud of ya.
All in all great season."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great weekend for Joseph. The only repeat face on the podium for the two nights. He should run all of the XR races next year because he seems to shine in that series. Had great runs in the XR races at Gondik Law also.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,I'm very proud of you guys. I have been watching your channel for a while.  Have a good off season guys
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Let‚Äôs go! Been coming back every hour looking for the second video.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,What a race.way to overcome adversity. Good job to #stepchild. What a team
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Now that's some hard core racing right there boys. Good job HTF one hell of a season. Look forward to next year's videos. YEE YEE!!!! Hell of a run Joesph that away driver. And a High five to the crew good job.

2,OYjOC59lEzs,"HECK YEAH!!!!!  I find it hard to believe that I am watching the same race team that I watched last year!!!  Joseph used to be really good only if he started up front!!!  Now, he is out there passing people like he is Davenport or Overton.  From 15th to 3rd and these are some of the best racers in the country!!!  I am so IMPRESSED!!!!  It appears that you guys now have much more equal equipment than ever before and Joseph is proving that he knows what to do with a real hot rod!!!!  Thanks to all of your sponsors, but especially Langenfelter Mechanical Contractors.  Hats off to every member of the HTF Team and Family!!!  You guys are awesome.  I honestly can't wait for next year!!! Going to try to order myself a hoodie right now!!!  Enjoy your time off and have a great CHRISTMAS!!!  Best Wishes to everyone!!!"

2,OYjOC59lEzs,Awesome job guys we love watching you all it shows that hard work pays off and good guys do finish up front. üõ†Ô∏èüèÅüèÅ
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Wow, way to March through the field Joseph!  The video didn‚Äôt show much of Overton and Superman but I think the fastest car was the one with no power steering!!   Jessie great job all week from qualifying to a respectable finish in the c A Main"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"WTG HTF!!!!  Wow Joseph, someone lit ya fire!!! Took a few laps for that hard tire to fire, that's for sure!

Let's Goooooooo!!!    #HTFNation   Be Safe"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Dandy driving and sticking with it!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Congrats Joseph and Jesse and the whole HTF team.I almost fell off my chair when Joseph pulled into 3rd.You guys may be a small team,but you've got the biggest never give up attitude I've ever seen.üèÅüèÅüèÅ"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"After that race,he can definitely run with the big boys.Very impressive. KEEP IT GOIN!"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Longhorn looked bad fast boy's, good job and keep fighting. Dont give up"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Heck of a season y'all can wait for the announcement from PRI, and for what comes next season"

2,OYjOC59lEzs,Awesome job HTF Crew!! You guys have improved so much last 3 years!  Hard work pays off and The future is bright for HTF Crew!! üëçüíØüî•
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great finish to the season HTF!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"That was awesome Joseph, good job, Longhorn makes any engine look good."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Gotta say that was exciting to watch! Didn't look good for awhile but Joseph kept digging and never quit. That is how you win the big races. Who knows what would have happened if he had started near the front.  Good job to Jesse, too. Congratulations to the whole HTF crew. Couldn't have done it without everyone working together. Great way to end the season and I can't wait to see how far you go next year!"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Nice job for whole team keep the videos coming enjoy every minute of it great season
2,OYjOC59lEzs,sharing the podium with Davenport and Overton is a pretty good sign you guys are trending in the right direction for 2023! Have an awesome off season boys! you earned it!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Now that's how ya Hunt the Front! Stay Thirsty!!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,How bout that crew ..  never give up. Paid off. Great work by everyone
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Back to back third place finishes to end 2022, this team has come so far and with less than what is needed. I am blown away at the effort and drive that each of you guys put in to this. To win one, just one of these races is harder than people realize. The longhorns seems to have already shown that the move to it was the best thing. Now do you think it might elevate gator bait? I'm joking, he also has come so far in a short time. Great job guys."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Man that was probably the best race Joseph has run yet! That caution messed him up abit but once he got back to the bottom it was on like donkey Kong! He passed alot of cars! Great job Joseph and the team!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Congrats Joseph and Jesse great run this weekend!!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Congrats on a great year! Game changer going to the Longhorn chassis! Thank you lord for blessing our racing team! HTF! üèÅüôè
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great job Joseph and Jesse man Joseph I was sitting on the edge of my couch cheering for you the whole race that was pretty sweet and to come back and finish third wow what a year for the hunt the front crew you all are amazing now it's time for parties can't wait to see the next video take care of you guys
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Great driving Joseph & Jesse, I wish you'd of had power steering all night you would have given the leaders a run for their money. That was undoubtedly 1 of the best driving jobs of the season."
2,OYjOC59lEzs,There ya go keep us posted on  his position .
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"Got a pat on the back from Davenport...woohoo! Great job Joseph!! If there's one thing he deserves, it's the hard charger award!!"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,good run boys the only thing i could see on the longhorn is tighten up your limit strap a bit see if that helps in the handling
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Getting that Longhorn was the best thing that you could of done.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,What a job by the whole team. Jesse will get better the more he's out there. Just looked like the Dale just had too many ponies for that slick track and it just wasn't hooked to the track. Joseph did one heck of a job battling to the end. That's why you never give up just keep digging hard to the end.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,One heck of a race !!!! Remember to get your orders in by ‚ÄúDecember 14‚Äù!!!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great season HTF! WAY TO FINISH! Hope to see y‚Äôall at Cedar Lake & Superior again next year!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,What a race!  12th to 3rd and 20th to 14th!  Let's go!
2,OYjOC59lEzs,World of difference with the Longhorn!!üëçüëç
2,OYjOC59lEzs,"What race well done Joseph you  drove your heart out it was awesome to watch oh my god Jesse well done! 
All the best guys look forward to seeing you guys again next season. Thanks for sharing guys all the best"
2,OYjOC59lEzs,One of the best races I‚Äôve seen at this track
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Great job this weekend you guys. Im looking forward to next season! Happy Holidays
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Heck yeah guys! I was too excited watching Joseph battle back. Also congrats to Jesse on a nice finish! Can‚Äôt wait till next season.
2,OYjOC59lEzs,Man oh man Joseph was up on that wheel! Carry that momentum into the next season! Maybe start the season by watching Joseph get ‚Äòer done! Oh and get the man his motor back!! Great year! Get that 56 back on the track! üôèüëäüí™üëç

2,9yatAJVA_4E,so is the barrel roll a standard feature or optional extra /
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Lol who thought that the car is  deep in the water after seeing thumbnailüòÇ

2,9yatAJVA_4E,Me stuck in traffic: Lets put the car on Barrel Roll mode.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Omg this is such an awesome selling point. I love doing barrel rolls on my way to work every day but could never find an SUV that could do it!!!
2,9yatAJVA_4E,This is just about the limit of what is humanely possible-kudos to jaguar and team-Good luck with your sales-you guys deserve more-üòçüôÇüôÇüòäüòäüôÇ
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"You know, when a car manufacturer produces and releases a commercial like this, that's what makes me wanna buy the car even more"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"I would love to see the effect this had on the car. it must've damaged it at least a bit, but from the video it doesn't look that bad"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,imagine how many cars they have crashed before
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Modern vehicles are insanely awesome and so capable!  Amazing..
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"To do this at a launch event...HUGE balls ! Great work, Jaguar !"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Definitely makes me proud to be an F-Type owner when one of the clan can do an amazing feat such as my sister F-Pace.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Even with this specific car's upgrades, it broke every single suspension part after this stunt."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,This stunt was predated by the barrel roll done in the James Bond movie The Man With the Golden Gun back in the early 1970's using an AMC Hornet. The jump was successful on the first attempt which is what you see in the film.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Damn Jaguar that next level of off road there. I need to try this with my minicoutryman  before I buy my SVR.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Asphalt8 players be like:

2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Jaguar, you have stepped up the car commercial game a couple of notches in some time now. Well done."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"I think that guy given some time and tuning could have done this in any car 

show us why it is so unique why is it a Guinness world record"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Curious how much of the car was still factory in this stunt. It has a full roll cage, skid plate all across the bottom, air bag sensors disabled. If I had to guess, the entire suspension has been changed as well."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Would love to know what type of damage it took from that
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Beautiful car ‚ù§Ô∏è
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"From seeing Unknown Stuntman and Dukes of Hazzard Making Of¬¥s I know one thing for sure: no car gets away unharmed in those stunts. They needed several shots to get this stunt done. You can see it by the headlights being on and off in several angles at the same moment. At one shot you can see the light shut off by the hard landing. So at least they did this twice and probably one car didn¬¥t survive. I am also not sure how a barrel role could be a world record nowadays. How many cars did barrel rols before? I mean, I¬¥ve seen Monster Trucks doing backflips and frontflips."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,The art of performance is in hand of driver
2,9yatAJVA_4E,That was freaking awesome!!!

2,9yatAJVA_4E,I hope the bone and internal engine parts of the vehicle are correct or well after the shock congratulations to the driver for his stunt
2,9yatAJVA_4E,at 0:36 (0.25 speed) we can clearly see that the rear left wheel arch got smashed pretty badly. The next shot when the lights are off is showing a different car from the initial one.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"well done Jaguar,what an awesome looking motor."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Ever since tata motors took over jaguar and land rover, they have been consistently upping their game"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Bringing asphalt game into reality
2,9yatAJVA_4E,The art of performance.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Banger drivers do it all the time around the country.Its called ramp rollover and theres a clip from wimbledon (spedeworth) with one car barrel rolling straight back onto its wheels without a curverd landing ramp just a flat track...Still impresive at a launch.Imagine the bad press if it went wrong.They say you have to gamble at times to achieve.For jaguar this gamble has paid off.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Great, now can we see it in real time without all the flashy stuff? Also, get the wheel on the proper side!"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,A legend company product üëå Hats off to TATA

2,9yatAJVA_4E,"If I remember correctly some Mercedes SL AMG did basically the same trick, only in a tunnel with all wheel in contact at any given point."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"i think any car or SUV will do this, it's all upto the driver and alignment made to perform this action‚úå‚úå"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Thats the talent of the driver üòà
2,9yatAJVA_4E,0:35 - 0:36 that rear wheel is taking a beating.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Afterward, the suspension was never the same again."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"can't say it wasn't daring, well done"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,pure perfection
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Just the feature i was looking for!!
2,9yatAJVA_4E,back and neck pain for days thanks jaguar
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"OMG, Phenomenal vehicle...."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Impressive, ballsy method of unveiling a car. Well done Terry."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Skill and confidence level it's over 9000
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Yes this sort of thing is very important to me in a car. Can it also pole vault?
2,9yatAJVA_4E,One of my favorite car...

2,9yatAJVA_4E,Keep going JAGUAR love you
2,9yatAJVA_4E,It was a very rough landing which is why they cut the angle 10 times upon landing

2,9yatAJVA_4E,This was cooler than the M5 drift
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Can we get 1 continuous unedited shot of the roll?  The 20 camera angle changes were a poor choice.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Me: watches this video

Me: goes to dealership 

Me: asks if the barrel roll is an option 

Jaguar: yes

Me: buys it so I can get through traffic"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Just Like In James Bond: The Man With The Golden Gun, The Corkscrew Jump From The Guinness World Records."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"I thought that this only happens in asphalt games... 
Now came to know that it happens in reality üòëüòë"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,No airbag? Or was the impact from the fall not enough to deploy any of the bags?
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Beautiful car amazing.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Come on Jaguar, you can do better than this. It happened live so show the entire stunt from start to a rolling stop and it doesn't need music, just the sound of the car, the stunt and any audience that was there."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Awesome üòçüòç
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"If people of the past, with their carts pulled by horses, could see that we can perform barrel rolls with our cars now."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Will the production car also have a full roll-cage built in it?
2,9yatAJVA_4E,My dream car

2,9yatAJVA_4E,OMG Great performance
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Can't wait to try this out.
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"How many sensors did turn on after the roll?
Was the service after barrel roll expensive??"

2,9yatAJVA_4E,"""Sir, you literally overran 7 speed limits and performed fatal stunts in an SUV."""
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"for all those saying Jaguar is now the best... the car has been upgraded specifically for the task with a full roll cage, body work, and suspension"
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Whoa that was INSANE
2,9yatAJVA_4E,"Dear Jag, these new eyes similar of F Type look great. Should be applied to other cars especially saloon ones."
2,9yatAJVA_4E,I luv this car... In future i bought this car
2,9yatAJVA_4E,For the one who are questioning and demanding uncut video..would you do one barrel roll when given a chance.üòÅ
2,9yatAJVA_4E,0:29     I think they wanna advert that this car can roll over several times !!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Guess what : Ratan Tata ji brilliant mind behind this huhüíôüôåüèª
2,9yatAJVA_4E,the very definition of hold my beer
2,9yatAJVA_4E,cool now ill buy this just in case at some point i need to do a barrell roll in the middle of hte highway cause there are that kind of ramps just laying around there
2,9yatAJVA_4E,The last thing I expected from Jaguar
2,9yatAJVA_4E,Incredible!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This advert was the source of so much terror in Britain, it's pretty notorious for how effective it was at scaring people into driving carefully. Every time it came on TV or at the cinema (and it was on before EVERY movie mind, even the ones aimed at wee children) you just felt the whole room squirm. Nicely done ad, surprised it didn't stay around for longer."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"One of the best Think adverts I‚Äôve ever seen. Most of them are great as it is but this one and it‚Äôs message is seared into my memory for life. 
I also never realised the difference between 40 and 30mph in hitting someone"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Bring these ads back!! Spread awareness even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable for viewers
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I remember seeing this as a kid and laughing about it with my friends, but even now it comes into my head when I feel like I could do 40 in a 30 zone! Guess it worked :P"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"If i wasnt napping in the road, theres a 100% chance ill live
"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This advert is one of the best ""Think!"" have made, its clear, to the point and the its is graphic enough to stay in your mind. + i don't think the drivers drover for her on purpose, im assume she would have, for example, run out into the road without looking or something like that."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I remember this advert from when i was a teen, only started driving recently and remembered it. Although does anyone know the chances of survival at 20mph? Most of my area (Brighton & Hove) are 20mph, all the 40's came down the 30 also back in 2011ish.

BTW accidents have gone way down because of this."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I find ads like these interesting. Instead of telling people to never hit anyone at all, they go for a more empathetic approach. Accidents happen sometimes, but keep the speed calm so they don't end in death."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This was the scariest advert ever when I was a kid :O
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I remember as a child, this advert scared the hell out of me. Used to cry for ages when I saw it."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I remember when I was 10 when this came out and obviously it scared me and didn't understand what it meant, and I was scared to tell my Mum but I thought it's the only way I'll feel better and then when I did she explained and said well done for telling me. Love my Mum but then it all made sense"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This was honestly the most terrifying advert around when I was little O.O
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This advert gave me nightmares as a kid lmao
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"That kinda reminds me, when I was like 10, my dad was driving me to school. And, a car came out of nowhere and almost killed us. But, if there was no 30 limit, I wouldn't be here today. So, I'm glad,"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,That ad was honestly quite helpful for careless drivers.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Iv been friends with the girl in this advert since I was a baby and this is the first time iv watched this advert since I was a child and it was released because I cried so much 
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"""Stop trying to hit me!"""
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Ok one quick story about me, When I was 9 I used to go out with my friends and didn‚Äôt care about the signs. But one day, My friends decided to cross the street and we didn‚Äôt look both sides and we just went for it. There was a car on my right hand side and I tripped on a rock so I couldn‚Äôt stand up in time. The car was coming at 40mph and I crawled and the wheel on the car broke my leg and I screamed in agony. I had my leg broken for 4 years and I‚Äôm on crutches and I hate it still, but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm still alive."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Another thing people don't think about is how big reaction times change between the two speeds, this advert shows what happens if you hit someone AT 30mph. 

At 30mph, if someone steps out 15 metres in front of you, you'll be braking for the last 6 metres. It takes 14 metres to stop from 30, so it's safe to say you'll be closer to 20mph by the time you hit the person that stepped out. The survival rate at 20mph is 97% or so. 

If you were doing 40mph, you'd be on the brakes for half that time. According to the RAC, 40-30mph takes around 10 metres itself, so in 3 metres you won't even be below 35mph. If you hit that same person at 35, the survival rate is only about 50%.

Some of these figures will have changed due to potentially outdated braking distances and improvements in pedestrian safety, but it's still relevant. 10moh slower will make all the difference, whether you hit someone at speed, or whether you have time to slow down."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"According to a BBC program from the 2010, if you hit someone at 30mph there's only a 27% chance they will live. Does this mean cars have become more deadly to pedestrians or do they just invent statistics?"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"""If you hit me at 40 miles an hour, there's an 80% chance I'll die. If you hit me at 30 miles an hour, there's an 80% chance I'll live. Stop trying to hit me."""
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This advert is so so terrifying, it was actually shown that the cinema back in the 2000's"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,when I was a kid this advert used to give me nightmares for about 2 years :'(
2,HeUX6LABCEA,I was once hit by a car at fair speed. My ass was blue as the ocean at night for about a month.¬†
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This terrified me as a child so much so that I'd run away from the TV it was on screaming and crying and my mum had to run after me and calm me down. I wouldn't watch TV for about 2 days after I saw it.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This advert used to scare me so much I couldn't sleep!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Or, hit her at 0 MPH, meaning DON'T FUCKING HIT HER!"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I'm 16 years old and yesterday my life was nearly taken.I was hit by a car that was going BEYOND the speed limit,my leg is injured and I'm suffering from a form of shell shock,when I was little this advert used to scare me but after what happened yesterday I can honestly say this is very true and very real.I was on the pavement and some idiot decided to do a U-Turn into me, he drove off and although other drivers chased him down no one caught his plate.My life was a second away from being taken."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I think it's supposed to represent a comparison between the two speeds. If she was hit at 40, she would be thrown against the tree, her bones would break etc. If she was hit at 30, she would have just stayed on the road."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,5 years after sarah being hit..... i was also hit by a car when i was aged 10 years old....... the driver a fireman on his way to work was doing 50mph in a 30 mph...... built up area full of kids playing !!! im a mircale i 'walked' away. the impact of the car hitting me .. has left me with bad knees.. i suffer alot of pain .............. alot of nightmare............ and why?????????? CUZ PPL NEED TO REDUCE THEIR SPEED! YOU DONT EVER WANNA HIT A KID.............. UR NEVER GET OVER IT
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"'If you hit me at 40mph, there's around an 80% chance that I'll die. Hit me at 30 and there's around an 80% chance I'll live.'

And if you play on the pavement or grass where you fucking well should be when cars are driving past, there's around a 100% chance that you'll live."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,If I wasn't in the middle of the  bloody road in the first place you wouldn't hit me at all.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This use to scare me when I was younger this advert the nightmares I had Jesus
2,HeUX6LABCEA,THIS ADVERT MADE ME CRY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER!! Scary shit smh
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Damn this must have been seen in cinemas and people were traumatized by this üò∞
2,HeUX6LABCEA,I got hit by a car at 30mph a couple of months ago... weird I was watching this ad a few days before
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"""If you hit me at 40 miles an hour, there's around an 80% chance I'll die..."""
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Hit me at 30 and there's an 80% chance I'll live.
Hit me at 40 and there's an 80% chance I'll die.

Challenge accepted."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Oh, I do hope they show this during Thomas & Friends."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"If i saw that, I won't be going 30 or 40, I'd be going as fast as that car could go. Hell na. I ain't dealing with no zombie kid!"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Great advice!Thanks!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Bruh this ad used to give me the fucking chills cuz when I'm walking in the dark and I think of that ad my whole brain just panics thinking that the dead girl is behind me now when I watch it I watch it with no sound then I would close my eyes cuz I was so fucking terrified ;-;
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"If you driving at 40mph, there's around an 80% chance that I'll die. Drive at 30 and there's around an 80% chance I'll live. If you were driving at 80mph, then well you would of driven past me wouldn't you?"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,they used to show this during the day and it scared the shit out of me when i was 5
2,HeUX6LABCEA,the blood going back into her ears still makes my toes curl
2,HeUX6LABCEA,this advert gave me nightmares when i was a kid
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This is a really powerful advert. I always remember this one.
Really does make you think about things for a moment.

Of course, there is always some shallow minded fuck that says something like ""It's just a¬†creepy advert."" People who think that are just pathetic.

It's not creepy, it's moving and thought provoking."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,If you don't hit me at 86mph there's around a 100% chance I'll live....! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2,HeUX6LABCEA,She may of fainted before the impact of the car hitting her (she saw it coming towards her and froze) which led her to be lying on the road then being thrown to the side when it came at her.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Someone did this in college today (we were acting out adverts) and omg O_O it was spooky
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I thought it was kph, but now that I think of it the UK isn't completely metric (using stones for weight, for example)."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"However, drive at 80 mph and you'll speed past before i even step on the road"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,First thing I thought of too...  I have incentive to hit more people now and feel less awful about it!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,We watched this in the cinema when her hand clicked everyone went eww xD
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This advert deserves a f**kin Oscar. It originially aired YEARS AGO and yet, it's December 2021 now and every now and then I always think about this advert secretly to myself... I swear it will be the most random thing...And I never bring it up because literally nobody but myself would care about some advert I saw years ago, know what I mean? People have more pressing things in this hectic life to deal with. Will I still remember this advert in 2050 when I'm 65 years old? Probably"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Hit me at 30 and there's an 80% chance I'll live
Hit me at 40 and there's an 80% chance i'll die
Hit me at 88 and there's a 100% chance I'll go Back to the Future"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This advert always used to scare me
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"'If you hit me at 40mph, there's around an 80% chance that I'll die. Hit me at 30 and there's around an 80% chance I'll live.

Please stop aiming for me"""
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"drive over me at 5mph and hear my bones slowly crack, hear my lungs burst, and blood spurt through my ears."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"And, if you get hit at 10 MPH, you'll almost certainly survive with at worst a few broken bones."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"First time i saw this advert i said ""i'll hit you at 60 so there's a 99% chance you'll shut the fuck up!"" haha got a good laugh but its pretty serious advert!"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Where does it say she was playing in the road? Judging by what I can see she was walking home from school hence the backpack STILL on her back and jacket. She looked out and saw that there were no cars so she crossed, simple as that but she was hit by an unexpected car that most likely sped around the corner. I was hit by a hit and run driver at 1:45 yesterday afternoon, I was on the pavement walking home, it wasn't anybody else's fault but the drivers."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,she just ran out in front of me wasnt my fault i was only going 50mph
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"@sociopathicregret But think about it, it depends on the situation lets use an old situation, a kid can just come running onto the street, the reason you did not detect him earlier is because he was behind a bunch of bushes and just darted onto the street, so if the driver was driveing at normal speeds, the driver would have caused less dammage apon the child. because if you tryed to swerve it by breaking and turning the wheel u'll just squish the kid and ull most likely be hurt as well"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"@giovannimartinezm5 Most situations are not like that. Almost always there are cues. And the only way to prevent that entirely is to drive 0 mph, so we're left with the conclusion that we should just stay alert and be able to brake with in our sight distance/drive for the conditions. Also, we should teach our kids to stay out of the street. "
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Holy sh*t...

and parents will not faint when seeing this?

but now I wonder...what's the chance at 20mph?"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,when her wrist goes back in it's gives me a shiver.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,i loved watching the charlie brooker version of this
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Don't cross the road without looking and while listening to your IPhone with ear buds in, and there's a 99 percent chance you won't get run over in the first place."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,my knees might not be so messed up if he was doing 30 like he was spose to have been ! he never even got into trouble with the law!!!!!!!! thank god the law has changed.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Girl: if you hit me at 40 miles an hour, there's an 80% chance I'll die.

Charlie Brooker: ""Right. If it's okay to hit her at 30 but not 40, why doesn't she just run away at 10 miles an hour when she sees the car coming? üôÑ"" -  Screenwipe S04 E01

Very good advert, should be re-broadcast every few years."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"well. normally when I think something is odd I read the description. the very first word of said description is UK, so there's a pretty good sign there. then going on it says that it's an add in the UK. something tells me this isn't going to be played in the US."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Well you're clearly in that 20% aren't you....
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I remember watching this when I was little, I had nightmares because of the fucking thing. "
2,HeUX6LABCEA,This is a really effective psa. I like
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I was hit by a car today and they were going at 30, god dammit I love this Psa, probably saved my life."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"It's funny 'cause it's true!
"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"The new road safety one is even creepier. Its the first related vid link ""Live with it - tv ad"".

Some of the drink driving ads in the UK are bloody creepy."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,I remember this ad
2,HeUX6LABCEA,GOD MODE ACTIVATED!!!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"no dude it's 88, a Delorean couldn't go 1955mph haha (just kiddin)"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,No. The UK seeks to always be different from the rest of Europe.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,The music stops it from being as traumatic to watch as it could have been.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This ad seems to be implying ""when"", ok what about ""if"" how about just don't hit the kid, or tell you kids to not run in the middle of the street, 30 kph and even 40 kph is practically crawling and barely fast enough to even knock somebody over, they portray this kid slammed into a tree like somebody was going 100 kph"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,that should teach dad to throw the ball into the street again
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"great ad, but what i don't understand- it appears that she slid back to where she was hit..in a reverse time lapse. how did she end up by the tree? some invisible person drag her over there?"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"This made sense. Shame it's not used for Smart Mways..If they were SLOWED DOWN, it would be easier to spot oncoming accident it's easier to stop further ahead to warn others"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Anyone remember  the One filmed on a mobile phone of the kid getting smashed by a car the used to play all the time in the early 2000s
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"Really, if you just saw a British PSA that references miles per hour, is there actually any need to ask if they use KPH?  Isn't it more than a little bit obvious?

In case that didn't clear it up:  Britain uses MPH and Imperial Gallons."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"""You're all going to die down here."""
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"What year is this from, as I'm sure I've seen this on TV? I'm guessing it must be late 00s?"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"We use both. Or the younger generation do more than most.
Learning imperial from our parents and elders and Metric from schooling, then using both in real life situations."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"If you're talking about the thing that looks like a worm crawling back into her ear, it's a trickle of blood.  I didn't see any insects on her."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"I was hit by a car once, so yeah i don't have the right to take the piss :P"
2,HeUX6LABCEA,If you hit me at 88mph. i'll be sent to 1958.
2,HeUX6LABCEA,0.13 why did her arm come out from behind her back when in previous shot it was on top of her?
2,HeUX6LABCEA,"because....

the UK still uses mph

wow."
2,HeUX6LABCEA,The inspiration for Claire from Heroes right here!
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Why is this 30 seconds long? Was THINK! really planning it this way?
2,HeUX6LABCEA,Because the British refer to the speed as mph as well...
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"Impresionante, una gran historia, un gran piloto y persona Coco Fortunato, cuantos recuerdos de su taller, mi viejo tenia su negocio a la vuelta y yo fui alumno de la escuela 1 as√≠ que todos los d√≠as al salir de la escuela pasaba por el taller de la Pe√±a Coco Pueblas y me quedaba viendo desde la vereda los autos que se hac√≠an, el 505 o el Falc√≥n de TC de N√©stor Apella, son muchos los recuerdos que se me vienen a la cabeza."
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,Que grande Coco! Fiel representante del Le√≥n! Cuando quiso levantar cabeza como siempre los poderosos lo mandaron a bajar! Pero queda en la historia lo que sabemos y es la verdad de la milanesa.
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"Que emoci√≥n ver ese PEUGEOT y al Coco Fortunato despu√©s de tantos a√±os. Felicidades a P1,  saludos desde Uruguay üëèüëèüëèüëèüèÅüèÜüçæüá¶üá∑üá®üáµüá∫üáæ"
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"Chicos gracias por este tipo de programas, por darles un poco de cr√©dito a todos esos pilotos que contribuyeron para que esos a√±os fueran tan lindos. No se olviden de Fernandino, Oltra, Der Ohanessian, etc..."
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"La parte comercial de las categor√≠as fue lo que las destruy√≥, porque tanto el TC como el TC 2000 eran dos grandes categor√≠as; hicieron y hacen ahora grandes negocios pero los espect√°culos son realmente p√©simos y solo un par de categor√≠as se salvan de la mediocridad actual.
Est√° clase de personas como Pardo y en este caso Coco Fortunato fueron los que hicieron grandes a est√°s categor√≠as que hoy son un triste espect√°culo.
Saludos y excelente el programa."
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,Que lindas palabras de Pronello para Fortunato.

2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"Que √©poca del TC2000 yo era incha de la fuego pero tenia un rinconcito del coraz√≥n para Coco, sabia del esfuerzo por lo que contaban los periodistas.
Por supuesto vi la carrera de Mendoza y no me gusto la jugada del flaco"
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"El aut√≥dromo Gral San Mart√≠n de Mendoza no existe f√≠sicamente ya que ni la provincia ni el ACA lo cuidaron, a pesar que en su momento corr√≠a el TC, el TC 2000 y corri√≥ la F√≥rmula 2 Internacional (tra√≠da por Angel Guerra), que no cay√≥ nada bien en Bs As (supongo que eso fue el detonante para su abandono hasta hoy y que es irrecuperable).-"
2,SxXbnmX3QdQ,"Muchas gracias, esas fotos del taller lleno de gente, son, espectaculares, y hablan por si solas de la calidad de personas de las que estamos hablando.

2,KSpVHhQJmNw,Camping in the rain is calming and relaxing. It frees you from the stress of everyday life. I love camping in the rain. Greetings from Germany and keep up the beautiful videos please
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"Greetings from Michigan USA, Very nice relaxing video. You are extremely well organized. I've used a few of your space saving ideas when I camp. I even enjoy setting up a tent in the middle of winter with 6 inches of snow on the ground. It is so enjoyable to ""get away from it all"" occasionally, sometimes your brain needs a rest. Stay safe and enjoy life."
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"I love camping in the rain especially in a cosy van, thanks for sharing your holiday, love from England in the UK. üòç"
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"Ol√°, comecei a ver seus v√≠deos e gostei muito , transmite uma paz, sou de S√£o Paulo Brasil, grande abra√ßo."
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,Love your car camping videos! How do you like the House tent? It looks very easy to set up next to sliding door. I am very inspired by the calm and peaceful nature of camping with your family.
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,What a fabulous idea to set up the tent as if it‚Äôs attached to the car.  Rain on a tent and rain on a car is such a peaceful sound.
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"Wow! This was very nice. The music and scenery is so very relaxing. üòå  Your set up looked easy to put up, and easy to take down. It makes me feel as if I could do camping like this. BTW- love the cute tent, table, lamp, and the bed set up and window covers give it a cozy feeling. 
What would be interesting to contemplate is a second tent/room on the opposite side of the vehicle if one has a large family. Or friends/guests. 
Is there another video showing how items were stored/secured during transportation? If so, I would love to see it. Thanks for the tour. And happy camping. üòä"

2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"I really look forward to your relaxing and calm videos. Isn't it weird that children never feel cold while we freeze. Your son is cool, a really happy and active little one. Bet this was an awesome adventure for him and brought you much laughter. The combi, tent set up is cosy and wish I was blessed with your talent for cooking. Eish, my kids look sideways at my attempts üëÄ but guess they reckon if they want to live they have to eat üòÉ. Enjoy your trips, camping üèï and adventures. Love from South Africa üáøüá¶ ‚ù§ ."

2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"As a long-time family camper in an area with frequent rain, I can say that rain can contribute to a very enjoyable trip ... if you start with the right attitude.
Just accept that it will take some extra effort, some things will go sideways, but it can also produce a lot of laughter and good memories. 
Just don't go into it thinking that your camping trip is ruined and you will have a terrible holiday ... because if you do, then it will be (ruined) and you will (have a terrible time). Your experience will really depend on you, not the weather."
2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"What a beautiful family you have, set up is perfect for you all, and your surrounding and views are stunning ü•∞"

2,KSpVHhQJmNw,"Thank you for this lovely video.
I found it interesting to watch how you go about camping- some things are the same as my family does here in Australia and other things are completely different! We would not think to have pasta for breakfast, for example, only milk and cereal. I think your set up is perfect.
I would like to see a bit more

29:30 X'D He got up and thought ""I am speed!""
Btw SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED for this setup omg lol. I would get an awning for the van so all you have to do is roll it out and get chairs/tables that you just unfold and they're set up. But I'm lazy so...
Beautiful video btw. Mom and Dad make a great team. Ty."

2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"Oh we know Devin, we know.....hopefully you're putting it in something sweet."
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,I just wanted to let you know that you have been my number one favorite person on YouTube to watch for the last month and I really hope you get more type r's and do them up bc I love it
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,Still waiting on a Ek AWD build!! Keep up the hard grind Devin! ü§òüèº
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"Hello Devin, I recently discovered your channel and it has become one of my favorite. I send you congratulations for your work from Romania, Europe. Keep up with this content !"
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,Can't wait to see what those k24s are going into! The suspense is killing me!
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,I'm enjoying these rebuild videos recently. Road to 1M!!
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"First one K24A2 TSX motor
Second one K20A2 Type S
If you want better head flow go with the 06-11 si head"
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,Driver side rear wheel looks hammered? Would love to see you fix it since you‚Äôre so familiar with powder coating. Oh and maybe hookup Val with a fresh powder coat on his X6M winter wheels. You should be able to bake all 4 wheels in 1 go in the big oven?
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,This channel has to be if not the only channel I watch religiously. I loved the builds before but when the Hondas showed up‚Ä¶.that got me hyped!!!

2,BqY7s-ST_H0,Look into 3D one for a one step polish brother. Two step is great when necessary but for real it's not always needed. 3D makes a good one step and can save you ALOT of time. Get yourself a yellow microfiber Rupes pad and 3D one and it finishes real fucking nice. Real easy to work with and knocks back ALOT of defects quick. Even finishes to a nice shine. Give it a shot my guy
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"Looks like what‚Äôs in my TSX haha devin is about to make some VTEC monsters for sure mad respect, still loving the Honda series keep up the great work you and Bobbi hopefully she‚Äôs seeing lots of success with boosted coffee."
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,So pumped for some k swap content!
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,Looks like more honda content coming soon. k-series engine in the house.üòä
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"Honda paint is so soft, I doubt you needed the blue pad and compound.  Just polishing should have removed all defects."
2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"You should give the new 3D glass polish a try. It‚Äôs by far the best glass product I‚Äôve tried. You might have to use a rayon pad if the etching is to bad. I figure if you had to break out the rayon you might just buy new glass. But you are always going deeper into fixing rather then buying so this might fit the Devin school of auto repair and restoration. 
Peace out ‚úåüèº

2,BqY7s-ST_H0,"Looks like a nice wet sanding job. For the future, remember not to wet sand so much of the freshly painted panels, because factory paint has orange peel, and a lot of times the fresh panels have a mirror finish, while the rest have a slight factory orange peel, and to a good eye, looks mismatched. But white is also very forgiving, compared to black and darker blues"

2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations Emelia!!! You deserve this amazing machine. Every Corvette owner needs to pick up their first one and drive it cross country. I did it with my C6 and it really is the best experience.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,You've done it! *What a stunning car* - you must be feeling quite proud of all your achievements. And rightly so - who wouldn't show off such an impressive ride?!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations Emelia on the new Z06. She looks beautiful and can't wait to see the future mods.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats from the ColeVette Experience!  We loved how you tied taking delivery of your Z06 into GM‚Äôs product launch themes. Also - Good for us to hear that GM called you to point out tracking the car after the first 1500 miles!  Your Z06 content is going to be amazing!  Out standing spec and the best price so far.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"As much as I enjoyed living vicariously through you and Phoenix before I got my own C8 I think I will enjoy your Z06 journey even more!  Congratulations Emelia, you've worked hard for it and richly deserve the rewards of that work!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats Emelia!  Looking forward to the White Stripes!  Somehow I expected a couple more pounds of oil pressure - maybe a couple decades even!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats, Emelia! 1mil subs and a Zo6 are what dreams are made of. Love the content and keep pushing forward."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations on that beast can‚Äôt wait to see the future of what you going in stored for it
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations Emelia.  Car looks amazing.  Matt Beaver is great to work with.  I only wish they could get more C8's from GM.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,this is so damn inspiring. you deserve every bit of this. congratulations Emelia !!!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats Emilia! You've outdone yourself with the colour scheme. That car looks sooooo good!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats! Matt Beaver is the go to fella for all things Corvette‚Ä¶Emelia, Stradman, TJ Hunt and of course SS717!!! He‚Äôs the man!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations, Young Lady!!  I finally got my Z06 order pushed through with this 2nd round.   Enjoy!!  I can't wait to be as excited as you are!!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations üéâ, I hope your an inspiration to the younger generation , HARD WORK DOES PAY OFF üôèüèº"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,You looked so happy with that car. TOO MUCH FUN! Don't kill it like James did lol.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Super happy for you, Emelia!!! Out of all the Z06s I've seen delivered so far, yours is my favorite, simply for the fact that you ordered your car with the best looking wheels! The wheels on yours look SOOOOOO much nicer than the boring looking black carbon fiber wheel option. Enjoy!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,The amount of editing that goes into your videos says a lot! Your videos are Outstanding! I would love to see a Holiday video giving thanks and praise to all of those behind the scenes! Those people are a large part of why you are so successful Emelia! Keep up the Great work! I can't wait to see what you are going to do next! 
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations Emilia, I'm very happy for you.  Stay cool and as always keep on rockin :)"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations on getting your channel to this level!  To be able to move to the front of the line and get your corvettes before that masses of wanting customers so you can help advertise the brand for GM is something only an extremely popular social media influencer can do, and that is an amazing accomplishment.  Most of the people that want to buy one of these will never be able to do so for many years, or without massive dealer markups they cannot afford, but at least they will be able to watch you enjoy yours, on a daily basis, over, and over again.  They will be on the edge of their seats while you do some donuts, hit some tracks, drag race, road race, attend some car show events, and all the other things they can only dream of doing with a new Z06.  You will bring an otherwise unattainable joy to thousands by visually sharing the every-person‚Äôs sports car to the every-persons that will never be able enjoy one except vicariously though you.  The fact that you said you won‚Äôt be flexing about it all quite yet truly reflects on your magnanimity.  Thank you so much for your contribution to the sports car loving community!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"So happy for you Emelia! Cool that Shawn was there! Love the wheels, color, 3LT package, Beautiful!üëç"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats, reminds me of how I felt picking up my brand new GT500 back 2020 it had 8 miles on it.  Nothing like that new car feeling you have for the first week or so.  Hoping to get my z06 here in the next couple years.  I want to make sure if there is any engine vibration issues pop up they get worked out first, that and I am wishing for a purple and black color option (dreaming)."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,So happy for you Emelia Your contact has been killing it you deserve everything you're getting God-bless you.  Beautiful spec. Wish you nothing but the best with it
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"You are a hoot. I love watching your videos and that you love cars so much. Good on ya Ms. Emelia. Thanks for all the positive vibes and that incredible smile too. Have a super cool rest of your week. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüòé
 The new Z06 is a beautiful build too the orange will go over big with the Clemson and Tennessee fans. I had a scirocco in the early 80s that was orangeish red but you did good on your choices can‚Äôt wait to see what this will look like in the next few months because you know you will 0:01"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"This was such an enjoyable video! 
You captured the excitement of getting the new car perfectly. So good."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations Emelia! I love it, especially the sound and the interior color!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I love this woman me and my daughters have been watching her for years. She is an inspiration to all girls everywhere. Emelia we love you soo much.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations on getting the new and beautiful Z06 Corvette Emelia! Awesome car!!! I wish you lots and lots of smiles per gallon!!! Happy driving!!! Stay safe!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations for the new ZO6 car Emelia, you have the best C8 Corvette information out of all the car You Tubers out there... the Stradman needs your expertise for his ZO6 someone didn't get the info that after 500 miles but not for donuts race tracking and probably not drag strip as well until 1500 miles"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,So cool! Curious about the highway mileage. I read it‚Äôs geared tall in the last gears.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Just found your channel. Awesome being able to take delivery like that. Unwrapping a new car is the best. Also, if I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd guess you and James (Stradman) were siblings. Same energy. Same vlogging style. Almost same taste in cars. Congratulations on the new Z!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations on such a beautiful vehicle üî•üî•üî• can't wait and see what you do to it
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Love watching her content! I like when they all collaborate together! It's cool they they all get along, DDE, EH, The Stradman, all of them. But... I have yet to see Supercar Blondie do anything with them?!? Is she a different style of car vlogger?!?! ü§îü§î"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats on the new car. Great colour choice! It looks awesome. If I ever get one that would be my choice in tribute to my father who once an orange 69 stingray. Can't wait to see more videos of it.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Merry Corvette! Proud of you Emelia, the Z06 spec is sick, the interior definitely makes it next level."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats on getting the z06. Love the spec on the car.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations Emelia, what a beautiful car. So glad to hear PA treated you so well, I only live about 20 miles from Whitmoyer Chevy. Keep making your videos and thanks for being an advocate for mental health."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats @EmeliaHartford on the Zo6! Looks üî• 
When is the new merch droppin? I'd like to pick something up. Thanks!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Great content. Emelia is an excellent influencer and deserves it all with all of her hard work, but please not so spastic on the camera work."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"You‚Äôre sooooo awesome!!! I was freaking out at work knowing this video had dropped and just got home and watched it (before dinner but with a cocktail üòé) and it did NOT disappoint!!!  No teasing just straight to the action!  Gorgeous car, I love the new ‚ÄòVettes but the Z06 is next level.  
I have a 2007 Z51 Triple Black C6 Convertible and love it.  I cried when the C7‚Äôs didn‚Äôt come with the round tail lights but realize evolution comes with letting some things go.  Chevy has really made me proud of the C8 ‚ÄòVette but with a price of $150K USD I‚Äôm scared to even check what the price is here in Toronto, üá®üá¶ üòÇ LOL
Regardless I love You, Your devotion to Mental Health Awareness (‚Ä¶ and YES I was one of the lucky ones that scored a Black Box so I‚Äôm excited for that to arrive), and for having THE BEST YT Channel there is.  Can‚Äôt wait to see the new Lambo when she arrives üòâ 
Peace and Love To You And Yours Em!!
üòäü´∂üá®üá¶üéÑü•Ç"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Great colour choice! Looking forward to seeing it with your personal touches.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I can't believe it has been a year since the commercial. This has been the greatest American car release since the Terminator Cobra. Keep kicking a$$ and you totally deserve this car.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations! You talk about competition and doing something different. Out with the drag strips and donuts! The C8 Z06 is practically a performance race car, for racing on a road track. Set yourself up with a racing school and learn how to really use the C8 and start going to track days. Push yourself and share the journey--it'd make for some great content. I'd love to watch you do it! Though it's fantastic, I actually don't want a street-legal Z06--I'm waiting for the Z06 GT3.R that Chevrolet should be releasing next year. I actually want two of them--one to keep ""spec,"" and the other to tune for even better power and handling performance."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats! Can't wait to drive this car one day. Looks a bit better without the rear wing in my opinion. Huge props to GM with this release.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats on the Z06!! Looking forward to seeing what you do with it!! ... Crazy that I pass that Residence Inn every single day and there it is haha I hope your time in Lancaster was good!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Thanks for bringing us along for the ride AH! That white interior is amaze
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Let's hope that it lasts longer than Stradmans one üôè. Love the colour üòç congratulations üéä
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"I know how frustrating it is to have to ""baby"" a new engine! You know you want to rip it, but you can't! And that moment you know IT'S TIME! üòÜ"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Delighted for you, hard work does pay off. I'm not a fan of the orange definitely would've went for the silver colour but you do you üëçüëç"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Always love the words ""Naturally Aspirated"". Thanks so much for bringing us along on this on this."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Love the new Vette ,I always enjoy your content... I watched the movie today, good job girl üé¨ü•∞ü•∞ü§ó"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Smiles for miles, Emelia!  As it should be with such a beautiful car!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations on your taking delivery, I live in Dayton, Ohio I'm sorry we missed you I'd love to have met you in person and check out the Z06.  Be safe in your travels."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"I'm not sure what's harder to get, this or the GT4RS. One will be the backup of the other. This would be the perfect replacement for my GT350R."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I love the color so beautiful the inside speechless you did good girl so proud of you keep up the good work keep putting out this content I can't wait to see what else you do from my family to yours Happy Holidays.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Emelia your color choice and your interior is A++++.  I love them. Again, your enthusiam puts a big smile on my face."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Definitely like the subtler-orange on white than the other way around.   Though I dunno, that army green next to it might have been hard for me to resist if I was going there.  :)"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"You are by far my favourite girl found on YouTube, love cars and make a name for yourself,  good on you.  Love your content."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,You always put dope colours in your cars this one is üíØawesome
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Emelia so happy for you you deserve all the good things have a very merry Christmas
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,You're brave having a white interior. I can't do that. I can make that interior dirty just by looking at it. ü§£ Love the content!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats on the new car! The spec is amazing!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats E, I was excited too see the silver and red spec . But the orange and white looks really good. Your gonna have a hard time controlling yourself to 1500 miles üòÇ"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I love Emelia  excitement the whole drive!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I‚Äôm so HAPPY for you Emelia! Your new Corvette is absolutely GORGEOUS and AWESOME. And your wide smile shows how happy you are too. God bless you and stay safe - please‚Ä¶ Blessings
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"What a lovely tribute to Phoenix. Love the color choices, keep on keeping on!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Oooooo you did so so good! The colour and the wheel choice is spot on!! I like your rims better than the carbon ones!!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"I really love your smile, energy and charisma!  Incredible car!!!  Congrats!!!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations on Your New ZO6 love that color, it‚Äôs Gorgeous definitely going to turn some heads.

2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats Emelia! I'll be right there with ya! I pick up mine this weekend!! So esssited! Peace gurrl.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Hope you love it as much as you deserve it!
Personally, I hate white interior since it gets dirtied WAY too easy"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congrats on the new Z06, enjoy it.  What's the over/under on betting how long you keep it stock?  You passed right through my home town of Wheeling WV, but probably took I-470 to avoid the construction through the Wheeling tunnel.  At least I hope you enjoyed the mountain passes of PA/WV...."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats Emilia to all your success with over a million subscribers and the delivery of your very own Z06.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Good for you Emelia! The car looks great.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Your pure joy, love and sincerity is so infectious. Stay RAD!"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,I would love to see you put a super charger on your Z06! In due time of course!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"That Corvette looks amazing, another great video üòÄ
üòç E-CREW FOR LIFE üòç"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations, you earned this and enjoy the new C8."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations! Awesome car. Incredible video. I love your energy and excitement. ‚ù§‚ù§
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,That colour combo is stunning and a great companion to the Italian flag.
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"I found your channel after watching Mike at street speed 717. seeing you pick up a car from his main dealer is cool. glad you both ended up with one.  Im from the UK so will probably never see one in the flesh, hence why I love your channel and his."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Congratulations Amelia on this beautiful speed machineüéÇüéäüéâüéâüéâüíÉüï∫üíÉüï∫üíÉüï∫üé∂üé∂üé∂üé∂ Enjoy and have lots of fun, happy driving.

2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Glad you got your car. Great choice on the color. However, I do not think Rick got an Amplify Orange one. And his VIN #001 was actually black, not the yellow one shown at the auction."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"So glad you decided to contrast with your C8 Phoenix! Can't wait to see the stripes and your #9 on her!ü•∞ 
Awesome you finally got your Z06....and I know you can't help itüòÅ, but EMELIA!ü§™ ...do not push it till the brake-in is done.ü§£ 
Driving her all the way back?ü§î ...that's a loooonnnggg drive.....you stay safe.üôè"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Love the color! Can‚Äôt wait to see you open that baby up!!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"One of the best jobs that I ever had was building those corvettes in Bowling Green, it‚Äôs so cool that you love them as much as I do Emelia , love your videos. I‚Äôm curious why didn‚Äôt you take delivery at the National Corvette Museum delivery option ?"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,So inspiring to see you pick up your brand new vehicle for pickup. I am hoping to do that with my very first brand new vehicle in the coming spring next year...
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations... You and your channel are AWESOME  AF ü§òüèª‚úåüèº
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Killer automobile, killer owner/driver...
Keep the shiny side up and enjoy this beauty Emelia, congrats."
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Chevy really stepped up their game with this new Corvette
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,8:18 I wonder if this is why James's one blew the trans seal and dumped out all the oil? As soon as he hit 500 miles he full sended down a track! Maybe that could/should be the first thing that's checked before you full send too?!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"congrats Miss Hartford, investment-grade All American exotic supercar. quite some mark-ups for the first and early customers but still a bargain considering the overall package that comes with it.
magnificent !"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Good and awesome video like all time Emilia. Congrats on the New c8 zo6, the orange looks so sick"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations Emilia what a beautiful spec love the orange üçä and white!
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"I really enjoy watching these pick up the Z06 at Whitmoyer's and drive cross country back home video's!
You should meet subscribers along the way!
Your spec looks üî• and the Amplify Orange is kinda growing on me a little!
Be well
-Shane"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Gtarz Emilia, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be bringing amazing content in the future. Orange color aside ü§£ I like the interior. But why the lack of carbon options? I saw a few missing, rims, side mirror, no striping... Hamm you‚Äôre wrapping it I‚Äôm sure but still... the carbon ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,"Hell yeah, congrats Emilia. Also the best color ever !"
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congratulations on all you have accomplished over the years
2,vMJ0qdFcyUU,Congrats on your Z06! Feel free to make a pit stop at Paragon :)
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"I don't think you should regret buying it, a used gauge cluster shouldn't cost too much off Ebay and the car is solid mechanically and body wise it's good. A few small issues but I'm sure you will love it once you repair them and get used to knowing the car. Keep up the good content man üëç"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Hi FranzJ. Owned plenty of e39s. Keep in mind what that generations problems are:
Jacking points love to rust and shove itself right into its own body. Make sure to jack it up right.
not sure about v8s but the valve covers love to dry out and leek oil right out of it.
The MAF Sensor (Mass air flow sensor) dies so make so it works because if it doesn't the car will just drink a lot more fuel.
Oh and the gauge cluster. Switch it out. or just deledd the original screen for a new one. Switching it out for a different one requires it to be coded in.
The e39s are lovely, the do love to break and eat your money but do some tasteful mods and you'll have really fun, especially in the winter."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"""I maybe regret buying this car"" -average bmw owner mindset"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"franz just buy another cluster for an e39, it'll work but be angry about the mileage difference.  You'll be able to read what its warning about. They're cheap on ebay. In the meantime fix your keyfob. bmw door lock cylinders like to stop working if you use them too much. I don't think the e39 ones have the annoying rechargable battery like e46."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"The E39s do be like that sometimes. As long as it doesnt rust or the engine starts knocking there isnt much to regret. Just find used working parts and someone that is a bmw fanboy local to you for coding etc. Anyways, great content as always"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,Next car you should get should be a 2001 Ford Focus. Great car for really cheap
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"240k miles for that bmw means its basically factory new cond almost min wear, around 0.065 i'd say"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"240k miles is a lot for any BMW, the most I can say is good luck soldier"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Nah man, don't regret buying it. Classic cars like this need a bit of tlc, get a cluster on ebay 2nd hand. You'll be right.
It's good content."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"it took two videos to go from ""I really like this"" to ""I'm starting to regret this"""
2,2um-ny9KZy8,The new Franz car arc is the most hype thing I've seen in years
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Can't wait for you to get her fixed up, no idea what you were trying to do with the cluster there, just replace it üëÄ"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"love seeing franz car content bro, keep this shit up fr"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,i hope you got this car for like 200 dollars max
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"If you‚Äôre looking to modernize the interior/just make it look nice, I‚Äôve had to go on a journey with my e46. I noticed it looks like your head unit is burned out, which is how mine was when I first got my car. I went for months with a jbl speaker but I went on Amazon and ordered an eonon apple CarPlay/android auto head unit and it‚Äôs plug and play and the fitment is flush. Only took like 30 minutes to install and i had to do it the hard way since I have factory navigation in the back"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Algo brought me here. I haven't related so hard in a long while it's like I'm there working on it with you, haha. I've got 3 of these and I think I'm getting my 4th, a wagon soon. To read codes another way could be with a software called INPA and an obd2 to USB cable. My 3rd one has the mileage like stabbed through or something so I used INPA to read the milage. 

Good job getting the car to not pull so hard to the left anymore. Seems the tie rod on that side might be giving up soon or a bushing or two are bad on that side. Gonna be a real fun time watching that get sorted out.

edit: timing chain guide replacement will bankrupt your ass if you're not ready for it lmao the 6 cyl doesn't have that issue. Just don't over-rev it and maybe they won't grenade themselves? You've been warned."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,Edgebug? More like hedge fund hop in the porsche
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Yeah it's gonna take some work. Even if you can't be bothered fixing it, you can just turn it into a drift missile."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,bro said 21 so many times he almost turned into drake
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"Wouldnt reccommend buying a new cluster. Just get a new LCD from ebay. Its like 20 bucks with cable and if youve fiddled with electrics before ""fairly easy to replace"". If you replace the cluster you will get a bunch of warning lights if you dont have a BMW diagnostics/coding tool"
2,2um-ny9KZy8,"This is very unfortunate Franz, hope the next video has it working."
2,2um-ny9KZy8,7547 doesn‚Äôt add to 21 it adds to 23
2,2um-ny9KZy8,this car got sum funky to it

2,dh9d-IlPSFE,You need to run a filtered lid on those thin filters. Freiburger has a really good series called engine masters and they tested this.They also found out putting a salad bowl on top of the carburetor like a velocity stack increase horsepower.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The problems on that Cobra came as no surprise. I took one look at that thin filter on an engine that size and figured it would be a problem. Gearheads have known that for about 50 years. On the bright side, you just proved just how much of a difference it can make. Good info even if not new. There are lots of people out there that don't know this stuff. The price of a taller filter element is a lot less than most speed parts."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The filters with the top entry added always look a good idea, the main thing I have found that makes the biggest difference especially in a street car with a large engine in a restricted space is a good supply of cool air so ducting into the filter is best choice.
Nice to see you looking a bit more chipper !"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"LOVE IT, everybody who works on issues and troubleshoots knows that victory dance when you figure out the issue that has been your enemy forever.  Good job on the park fix."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"2 days later,Will&Kimber walk into the shop and tell Kevin‚Ä¶Look what we just bought,a 5 speed Lenko trans for Soccer Mom. Kevin walks to parts washer and sticks his head inside and flips the ‚Äúturbo wash‚Äù switch!!!!!!!!!"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Try putting downward dimples on the underneath of the lid above each throat. Buell used these on the XB12 and they worked really well to smooth airflow being pulled around and downwards into the carb.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Trick I use for figuring out clearances for under hood stuff is to use Playdough.  I steal a can of it from the kiddo and build a narrow cylinder or pyramid then close the hood and it is soft enough to deform without causing damage to anything.  And it has enough integrity to be able to measure from it for clearance purposes.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"If you want a burn out car that can dual purpose and still have rear brakes just put the line lock on the rear brake line, engage with no pressure on the pedal and leave it on for the burnout comp. It‚Äôll have no rear brakes then when you want rear brakes, release the line lock and you‚Äôre back to full brakes."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Congrats on fixing that park pawl. Nothing more satisfying than figuring out something like that.
Drew's going to need a trapper hat now to keep his brain from freezing. Just be careful he doesn't start calling everyone a hoser. eh."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Seen that very issue many times with those Cobra air cleaners. It really kills the FE motors in Cobra's.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Definitely something that is very important for a racecar to have. The mechanism was a little weird to understand, but as usual you got it figured out!"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,My guess on the cobra is intake airflow is to restricted with that short filter.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Great video Kevin thanks for your time Can't wait to see the motor for your car you deserve it brother üëç
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,we all know that feeling when you've been working on something for that long and finally succeed at fixing that issue. can't wait to see the motor for the Cutlass
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Can‚Äôt wait to see some cutlass stuff. üëçüèº
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Another cracker of an episode Kevin. Fixing Park on Soccer Mom must have felt like dropping a load off your shoulders! Persistence pays off my friend :)
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Today,  I've finally seen an authentic grimace on Kevin's face. That grumpy look on your face was priceless when Soccermom still didnt go into park. I felt it."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Many years ago I was at my engine dyno guy's and he was running a really nice looking 302 Ford with downdraft Webers-think it was for a Cobra restoration. It had these little individual filters that snapped over the end of the velocity stacks. First run the thing was an absolute dog. Dyno guy immediately knew it was the filters, popped them off and it picked up like 120HP."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,If you really want to see that air filter kill one use it on a carburetor with the choke horn. Basically turns it into a 2 barrel.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Geometry is your friend! üòä My guess is that the linkage from the shifter to the trans is ~ 1/4 inch short on its throw into Park.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,We have the same problem with aftermarket air filter setups on MGB‚Äôs as they are flat where the factory back plate has a radius to smooth and direct the air into the carbs
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Hi Kevin! Glad to see the posting picking up. We all missed ya bud
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,another great video Kevin and those cobra airfilters are a very poor design. Talk about restricting air flow. Almost like trying to run the engine with the choke closed!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Great info on the air cleaner! Run the same filter on my sbf and this proves it does effect the afr. üëçüèª
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Poor engine not able to breathe well...with the taller filter in your plan that might reduce the loss but not eliminate it (as with any filter at all). Might even space the filter housing lower so an even taller filter could fit. Have fun at PRI! (and beans were spilled...Kevin uses NordVPN to watch Aussie burnouts!)
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"On the next episode of KSR. ‚ÄúWelp, Soccer Mom is stuck in park.‚Äù"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Man, that 8-1 header blows me away with the Animalistic scream it gives that engine every time I hear it"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The whole park issue hit home. So hard... the fact ive had issues with something for years, tried to fix it 100s of times. So freaking frustrating"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Neat stuff. My guess was that air filter being restrictive. Great video and enjoyed watching it. Thanks for sharing. ‚úåÔ∏è
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,See you are having fun at PRI show.  Congratulations on placing 3rd in Tom Bailey's Team Kart Racing challenge. üèÅ
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Cant wait to soo the oldsmobile start coming together man.. great video..
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Loss due to air filter. Yup, uh huh.  Don‚Äôt know if they make a top for those that is filter material but I bet that will help. Engine masters does a great episode on that."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Hey Kevin I seen KSR competed in the go kart races at PRI I wish you guys would've won but at least you were on the podium love what you do brother.  Seen the video on Steve Morris channel
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"First time commenter here.. but as you can probably see from my picture, I also have a cobra, with the same exact kind of air filter... with a holley sniper 4150 stealth.  You got me thinking to change my air filter and add a gap potentially.  I only have a 306, but I bet it makes a difference either way, who knows maybe it will fix my #4 cylinder being really rich!  Excited to see the outcome of this on your channel!"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I‚Äôm sure the tv station had to twist your arm so hard to get you to do a burnoutüòâ
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The only thought I had with you park situation is that something, and I'm not stating, in the shiftshaft/roostercomb or the pawl is different between case types and maybe mismatched.
Anybody? My experience only includes stock resto rebuilds on those."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,3:39 - Thought for a moment it was going to be time for a new shop roll door.  üò≥
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"I just put a K&N filter on my 302. 1/2 "" taller and I can feel the difference."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Wasn't expecting that much of a drop in power even with expectations that it was the air filter.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Air filters less than 2 inches are absolute horsepower killers
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Kevin, just a thought, but in the burnout car I'm wondering if you can help your visibility by a super high-powered fan inside the cabin that blows the smoke out the sunroof? Is that even necessary or possible? Seems like it would be quite unhealthy to live in that environment and you can't see anything so I'm wondering if evacuating the smoke might help? Just a thought."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Already use nord and ‚ù§it. Back to Soccer Mom, this is very awkward to Describe in the chat, but. The problem is probably to do with the interlocking spacer the parking crawl is supposed to engage with. I used to work for TCI. Found out that there‚Äôs variations of that spacer ring that locks the intermediate clutch pack in. Use the wrong one and the parking prowl will never engage."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I believe factory five makes a air filter that matches and fills the scoop in the hood
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,You starved it of air. I saw that the second you raised the hood with that low profile air cleaner. That would not even allow a stock motor to breathe properly.  EDIT after seeing your find I suggest you make a different lower plate allowing a bigger filter  but not raising the top where it gets into the hood.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The Journey of 10,000 steps likely involves many stumbles and/or stutters ü•∞

Keep On Going‚ù£Ô∏è"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,More problem solving with KSR!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,That airfilter is the issue for sure.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Drew's helmet is going to fit funny now!!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I was hoping y'all would win the go cart race!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Before you wreck the internals, I think that you should look at your case cuz that is short and that might be most of your problem..... Or order that internal piece that your plan on modifying again."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,My guess on cobra is the flat topped air filter housing reducing airflow where you want it.....
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"You should name the Lexus
 ""The Ocho"". Of course, this would be the Ocho 2.0"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Glad to see you back. Keep up the good work.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"""Sooo... I'm just gonna have to modify somethin'.""

How KSR wins."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,The cobra dyno graph looks like an air cleaner restriction.....air doesn't like to turn!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"When you opened the hood on the Cobra , the first that stood out was how restrictive the breather looked ."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,As soon as the hood opened I knew the air filter was the problem.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Good job Kevin. I had the same problem with my manual trans making a grinding noise and after pulling it 3 times I found out it's the clutch. Omg I wanted to shoot myself lmao
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Will you be racing sick week? I was excited last year to follow your races then attending Gainesville raceway and get some pictures of soccer mom!  Plus, I need some KSR gear!"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Aircleaner lid kills the power, its too close the throte body so air needs to turn too much."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The correct term for air is a fluid. A fluid describes gasses and liquids. You are probably getting turbulent flow at the inlet where the air has to turn which is causing some weird swirling and a bit of pressure drop. I believe this pressure drop will also be related to air velocity. So the higher the velocity the more turbulent the inlet becomes and therefore the more pressure drop at higher RPMs. Since it is naturally aspirated the engine relies on atmospheric pressure to push air and fuel in to the cylinders during the intake stroke. If you have pressure drop at the inlet less air will be able to enter the engine making it run rich. That is my guess. I am not an engineer, but I design downhole tools and deal with turbulent/laminar flow frequently. Pretty neat stuff that most people don‚Äôt really get to see in their everyday lives."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Well deserved win Bubba!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"air cleaner   Edit:  I guessed when you said guess,   bingo.  Amazing how much power a poor air filter can rob."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,guessing that air filter setup is resteicting flow. Looks like a very short element in there.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,What about a vented air cleaner lid? As soon as you opened the hood I knew that air cleaner was to thin.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,It should have had someone recording your interview and everything with the news that have been really cool for video. I can't wait till you start work on the Olds Cutlass
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Dyno issue - dyno'd with hood open and throttle linkage hits the hood when closed.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"yah...2.3 decades ago I had a client with the same issue with a 351, fuel was dripping out the side pipes...... I stuck a Kenne-Bell blower between the throttle body and the intake ports to over come the air filter restriction.....üòé"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Air filter is restricting flow into the Carb/Injection throttle body
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,That feeling when you think you fixed it and test it and it does the same thing is the worst!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Those thin oval air cleaners are a major restriction.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"You didn‚Äôt fail all of the times before, you were gathering intel"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Every time I see a one inch filter on an engine I laugh
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Kevin, Please reroute the red wire that is underneath Soccer Mom. It is triggering my OCD. Lol. I think it would look nicer if it had a sharper bend coming out of the transmission tunnel and heading towards the frame. ( instead of the gradual curve)"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Truth be told.... if it's broken long enough you will figure out how to fix it!!!!!
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,You need the clearance the bolt hold for that part bolted up to the case just clearance the bolt hole
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I was gonna say starving for air‚Ä¶. Get one of those fancy k&n breather tops lol
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Those stupid skinny aircleaners are at best useless. Probably ok on a 5000 rpm 351 but any more kill power. I had worked this out ever before you showed it. For perormance an open top filter is the go, even with a 2"" high main element. And that at 7000. On a 350 Chev. 
The Engine Masters filter clip proved this and my local dyno confirmed it using my filter on the 350. It had the same power with filter. Than without. It only lost a small amount with the cars usual 3"" recessed base paper element filter"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"You can burnout if you want to. 
You can leave your old logs behind
-safety burnout"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"""Stick with something long enough, you'll figure out how to fix it""
But what caused it to happen in the first place?"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"The Cobra is in my Top 5 of 60's muscle Cars, I have been in one but never been able to drive one.  my 65 mustang has my version of a Cobra ready 289/ 306 thats Capped at 4500 RPM, it is enough to get you in Trouble, lmao."
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Hey Kevin, differential brakes on the front axle of the lexus???
Never heard of it before, just had a thought??"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Another great video Kevin the things I learned from watching your videos
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,02:25 looks more like a fence problem.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Air filter causes a major restriction. Top is to close to the carb
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"24:58 valve spring

Well damn, you asked what happened to it not what you put on itüòÇ"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I think the air filter is restricted air in to the system
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Congrats on another podium in karts .. had to look twice at drew he raised his ears lol
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,The filter is sitting to low choking out the efi carb.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Great video again.
Congrats on the 3rd place in the Karts üëçüëç"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I think Drew got some sort of policing side-job :D
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Thanks Kevin, good fun (for science of course). Missing Drew's somewhat iconic mullet though. Dave J"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Can't lie - I was laughing when you said you backed it into the fence:)
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Air cleaner restriction is my bet on that cobra
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,Call it a fluid not a liquid. It's called fluid dynamics for a reason.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,When the trans starts going into gear. There‚Äôs no trans fluid pressure of some sort supposed to help pull it into gear all the way? And or the ending of that cilender piece has a snout on it. Looks like it supposed to slide into something like a pilot bearing !?
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,"Hey Kev remember ""Race cars are fun!"". Good Job hahahahaha"
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,The air cleaner is restricting air flow due to being to short in height
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,I know not many people notice but it makes my OCD happy that all your videos are exactly to the minute.
2,dh9d-IlPSFE,The air filter will change the AFM

2,s4UnMmg9nqw,The best part was mimi. And this was a master.  A disturbing masterpiece.
2,s4UnMmg9nqw,Charges just fast enough to stay out of the reach of Chester but for how long Chester is getting closer and closer and closer maybe it's time to relinquish that fire Kitty who knows maybe after Chester is done charge might be fast
2,s4UnMmg9nqw,ü§£ ü§£  #save the kitty.  That van rpms is hitting the high note for that srt
2,s4UnMmg9nqw,"If Chester is a windowless Van, than what is Chris Hanson? A SWAT Van?"
2,s4UnMmg9nqw,The fact that he didn't want a Crown Vic but showed a Mercury

2,TkoSHi3wqVU,That is pretty incredible to think about crafting a chassis to handle that much HP and to turn it around that quickly.  I hope the new car performs well for you next season.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,RWR Has jumped in to the deep end with the team glad to see a new owner not trying to cut costs and sink money into to the team unlike manny other new owners.thank you Clay for time and letting us in.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Smashed the thumbs up button for sure once again!! This was super informative Clay and Nick! Thanks to Don Schumacher Racing for giving us some of their valuable time and letting us peek into the operation!  Class acts all the way around !
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"This is incredible.    Neat inside look.  As always Clay, thank you for bringing us along!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great video, Clay. There's something about the simplicity and rawness of a guy with a camera just talking to another guy. It's a lot better than anything scripted with big names attached. 
Keep the videos coming!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Clay this was so FASCINATING AND EXCITING TO ME!! Thanks Nick for such thorough explanations without giving up ""secrets"" LOL..

2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thats really cool! I have always been interested in the chassis building and fabricating side of racing. Having a background in machining gives me a head start on understanding all the fab and fixturing. When you are a machinist you can make cool parts. When you are a machinist and you learn to weld you can build stuff!!  LOL!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,I never get tired of the behind the scenes videos. Awesome video as usual!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Really informative video Clay. Great to see you getting a new chassis. Nick seems like a great guy and very knowledgeable and professional !
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Another awesome video, Clay.  It amazes me the loads these things go through, and glad to hear that there are indicators ya'all check (I loved the sag analogy to ""like an old horse"").
I am curious (and fascinated by how the engine is mounted/attached to the chassis) and would like to see a video on how Jim Oberhofer has the engine mounted ... and reasons why. Please."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"We all love these ""behind the scenes"" videos!  Keep 'em coming!
I built both dragster and funny car chassis in the 1980s.  Very similar process than and now but VERY different, as well.
Two questions:
1. Do they always build the chassis with the driveline level?  We used to sometimes make it a couple of degrees up or down to change how the car launched.
2. Will your team have a spare chassis for the upcoming season?
Thanks and God Bless You!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Very informative information of behind the scene operation of building a top fuel drag car. Thanks Clay and looking  forward to PRI
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Congrats on the new car. I look forward to the greatest to come with RWR. What is the lifespan of the cockpit or of the car? Being as the front half and back half can be replaced. Is a new chassis a big deal or is it just expired NHRA chassis tag and you have to get a new one?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great video - love that you‚Äôre still pumping out great content in the off season. 

Love seeing these behind the scenes videos too - quickly becoming my favorite channel on YouTube!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Clay you rock! That was awesome! Nick knows his stuff. Peace
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Would love to see more about how these machines are built.
Bring it on Clay"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Very interesting and informative ! Nick and the whole crew must work well as a team ,   considering once the season starts anything can happen . Many thanks Clay , as always."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"The insight on the chassis was quite enlightening, specifically the rear being rigid while the front being flexible to keep the wheels planted and the car right side up."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Hello Clay. Good to see ya. Man this is really some interesting stuff here, very interested in the building of a high speed chassis,it's just beyond me learning now, not too old but too far gone health wise. Wish I'd gotten interested in it some years ago,may not be to far gone if that were the game"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,This is really cool I‚Äôve always wanted to work on/build a NHRA drag car!! Thanks Clay for sharing this with us!!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great video Clay,  hopefully you guys avoid any  ""incidents"" and have a safe season."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Awesome content as usual, Clay. I love the technical side of things since I'm an old machinist/welder and gearhead. I'd love to know more about the engines and clearances too."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,That was really interesting and loved the chassis shop!! Lots of exacting and precision work involved!! That‚Äôs awesome about the new car!! How much does a full chassis cost?? How much and how many front ends do a team have???
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Great video Clay! I've seen lots of videos on every part of the car but this is the first frame build video I've seen. Thanks
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Fantastic insight into what makes up the car..... Hope the new chassis delivers the missing piece to finally hitting the win light which we all know is coming.... More of the behind the scenes stuff that goes on into making the complete car üëç
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thanks for taking us on this trip Clay. Very interesting stuff !
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Another Awesome video!! I really like the build processes. Good job Clay and Nick!!!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"As you stated you've been doing this a long time but new young drivers or want to be drivers should watch this video to learn that's there's allot more to it a than just putting your bum in the seat.
Thanks Clay love that frame table. 
I grew up in a machine shop and now under stand why my dad would get mad if I was working on anything on one of his layout/jig tables."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Given the stresses placed on these welds at the track, do you ever x-ray them for quality control while building these cars?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Really interesting...how quick they can front-half a car, the numbered jig fixtures, how long to build a complete car, the nearly identical construction between cars, and on and on."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Awesome look behind the scenes, as always! Thanks Clay & good luck 2023!!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Hello Clay great video on behind the scenes at DSR making your new chassis. I know you can't wait for the new season to start next year. Wishing you and your family well. Happy Holidays Take Care
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"It would be interesting to know how Top Fuel chassis have evolved over the years , back in the day everyone seemed to use a ""Swindahl"" wonder how these chassis differ ??"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great job, there is a lot of work into the chassis to protect the driver and equipment. This was so interesting watched it more than once. Thanks Clay."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"The access you provide is incredible!!!! 

Thanks for taking me along!!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Was this strictly a performance upgrade, or was your old ride timed out?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Nick and Clay, do you customize the size of the cockpit based on driver size? While I'm too big to do this I suspect (6'5"" 285lbs), I'll bet there's quite a bit of variation in driver height, weight, leg room etc. Fascinating video - thanks Clay!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"#1 I saw Taylor was doing your seat pour, and I thought, damn! Clay is getting all new pipe!! It's been awhile since you have had a complete new car end to end?  And now you can carry a back up car too which is nice.   #2 The ""retired"" John Medlen working away in the backround is great."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Thank Clay for taking us to the amazing shop tour of Don Schumacher Racing !. Changing the front half of chassis in a Day is Amazing !.
Just curious how much is the cost of the chassis ?ü§î"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Definitely answered some questions I didn't even know I had thank you clay.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Q1, I remember years back that Larry Dixon had a problem on the front clip during a race.  He had to make a repair on the clip and welded on it; at the time I  said to my wife that I didn't think that was not a good idea.  On the next run the clip broke on him about 1/2 track and like to kill the poor man.  I would like to here your chassis guy's thoughts on that.  Q2, Looks like 4130 chromoly tubing, I see Tig equipment and what appears to be purging of the inside tubing with gas - all smart stuff!  Is there anything new today other than normalized 4130 tubing and a low carbon welding rod like ER70S-2 to eliminate embrittlement around these welds (Martensite)?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great video! How many runs did the team make on the recent chassy?
Take Care :)"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Clay when can I pickup the old one!!??  LoL.  Very informative video, keep them coming.  Do the chassis's get painted?  Hope NHRA notices the up tick in interest because of your efforts with You Tube.  Merry Christmas to the entire team, miss seeing them already.  Best of luck in 2023!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thank you. I love seeing the behind the scenes shop tours.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Awesome to see how they r built. Very smart dudes !! Go get'm Clay
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,You and the Team are wonderful people‚Ä¶ and I never knew you could drive a regular car on a real street‚Ä¶ ü§£ü§£ü§£
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Is there a chassis difference between the open cockpit and closed cockpit cars?  Great video, BTW!  Thanks!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Now this is my favorite type of video! MORE, please."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Hi Clay its Christmas early!! I have a couple if questions. Is Shoemacker pretty much the go to guy for chassis? Also how many spare cars do you usually have in üòÖinventory. Who builds the go peddle? Have them put some nice taillights on there so people have something to look at when beat them to the other end
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,A very interesting video. It makes me wonder how much designing is done before construction?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Thanks Clay and Nick that was absolutely fascinating. 
I‚Äôm from downunderüá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫ is there anyone down here going this for top fuel or do we import from the USA??? 
Thanks again üôèüèªüôèüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,A safe car begins with a quality chassis.  They got that part covered.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Nice! A 2023 car!   I hope it hooks well and goes straight üôè 
Thanks for another great video 
 #Badass"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"I‚Äôve seen this done in other shops other kinds of race cars, sprint cars and modified. In those repairs I saw fish mouth cuts and sleeves. Is this how you do a front half or is it straight cuts? Awesome channel Clay!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thanks for info on a Dragster Chassis. Awesome as usual. Thanks Clay.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Good to see RWR stepping up. üëç
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Two welders, weld the same time on both sides together. That takes quite the skill to do! And here's a probably stupid question: does a brand new chassis need a ""break-in"" period like a brand new blower would need some runtime before performing its best? Don't take my word on this but some chassis are pretty stiff when fresh and new, then become a tad flexible at the right areas until it becomes too floppy and need a rework. Either way, a new car is a new car!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Pretty cool of DSR to let you come to the shop. I know they wont divulge all the secrets but it was interesting to see.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Clay, I'm going to my first NHRA event July 21-23 Kent WA, tickets in hand with pit access, tix in hand for the entire weekend :) You're my fave driver, I hope to see you and your crew there! I'm so excited! - From BC/ Canada."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Back in 1969, Porsche created the 917. To save weight, it had an ALUMINUM tubular space-frame!  Pretty sure your frame is 4130 chrome-moly tube.  Anyway, the Porsche frame was prone to cracking, being of an aluminum alloy,  so they drilled little holes where members were welded together, making the inside of the tubes all interconnected.  Then they added a tire-valve so the frame could be pressurized with air, and a small pressure gauge.  If the pressure dropped, that indicated there was a crack that needed to be repaired.  So, I thought that would be a great feature on a dragster chassis... you could even use argon instead of air to ensure the inside doesn't corrode.  A glance at the gauge would tell you if there are any cracks after a particularly bouncy run, and a gas-leak detector could find any crack right away!  Has anyone thought to do that?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"It's obvious Rick is all in. Let's see if less frame flex can buy them those thousands that they were losing by this past mid season. Good luck, can't wait to see the color scheme on the new car."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thanks Clay and Nick.  That was pretty dang cool.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Awesome content Clay!  Very interesting!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,That is unique information Clay! Very cool. What alloy of tubing are these chassis made from? I‚Äôm wanting to say titanium but maybe that super light weight isn‚Äôt the only factor.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Clay thanks for the info and tour. That was really cool üòé!!!!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Very cool! 
Will you be having a canopy on the new car?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Clay it would be nice to show the People who have never seen a Chassis flexing as it goes down the track it's amazing to see.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Is Schumacher the exclusive builder for NHRA now? I cannot remember what frame we used in the Werner car (although Im sure you told me once or twice).. it's exciting to get a new car isn't it, Clay? Lol"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Awsome content very interesting. Thanks a bunch Clay
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,I noticed there‚Äôs a tank of Argon setting by the chassis. Are you purging the inside of the chassis tube as you‚Äôre welding it?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Cool vid.
One question, do the new cars have that new car smell?
Hi from NZ,
Anthony"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"what grade,  diameter and wall thickness do they use?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"I am still amazed how much horsepower a top fuel car makes. Just hard to grasp over 11,000 horse power from a V8 engine."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Once a top fuel chassis certification expires.   Can the Chassis be recertfied again or to a slower class?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Yay! New pipe, 2023 is looking better already!"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thank you for the video. I look forward to the next one.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Congrats on the new chassis
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,I remember not so long ago that one guy would build an entire chassis.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,I bet his heart fluttered every time Clay got a close up... Can we show that... oh well if not I'm fired
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Clay This might be a stupid question What is the fastest you have ever gone in a car? What I should have asked you besides your fastest in your current PARTSPLUS TOP FUEL CAR.   Maybe you went through the traps our in a different kinda car. GODSPEED
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,fixture... fancy name for a JIG.. Thanks Clay for the tour!
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Great video üëçstay clear of the so called Events üòä
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Omitting the Black Friday's sale I'm sure they have each year, what kinda price does a complete chassis cost??"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,@claymillican what happens to a TF & FC chassis at the end of its life with a particular team? Do they scrap them? Sell them?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Thouroughly enjoyed this video! Thanks Clay.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Great content Clay, really enjoy seeing these craftsmen and the engineering that goes into making these cars so fast and the level of safety that's built in to these chassis. curious to know if these guys also build the funny car chassis or are they separate operations."
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Are you going with a canopy or open cockpit on the new car?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Hey Clay, are you going to have a open or closed cockpit?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Who does the engineering work to make the frame? You say NHRA dictates a lot, how much room is there after they mandate to make changes to try to increase performance yet staying legal with NHRA?"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Will the other car become a complete spare now mate?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Great video and enjoyed watching.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Is the new car open top or capsule?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Thanks, Clay! Awesome video"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,So this means  the old car will be a spare per Eddie hill rule or are there 2 chassis being built.
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,"Do you notice the difference when you drive a new chassis or does it only show up in the E.T,"
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,That was awesome. Thanks Clay
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Clay is this car going to have a canopy cockpit ?
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Fascinating.  Thank you sir
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Love the BTS build videos !
2,TkoSHi3wqVU,Now that's entertainment! üëçüëç
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Gorgeous! What a find. It couldn't have found a better home.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Beautiful car Adam. Those minor issues will be easy to fix. Depending upon how bad it is you can probably fill and repair the air cleaner lower, at least as a temporary measure. I actually love the sound of the exhaust."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I‚Äôm a GM guy and I say your Ford looks awesome. Once it is old enough, fandom does not depend upon manufacturer."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Another great find Adam.  Can‚Äôt wait to see it all polished up!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Amazing car. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to look like a million bucks, when it‚Äôs detailed. An AM/FM stereo radio is a true rarity in ‚Äò68. Perfectly optioned."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Late 60s LTDs are the best ever! Gorgeous design. Congrats, Adam!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"It's astonishing how much this particular era of the LTD was so much more athletic and lithe than what came later.  The overall richness of the presentation seems quite sober, compared to later LTDs -- and actually most other 'near-luxury' cars of the day. And right up your alley.  Congrats; can't wait to see the transformation."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Beautiful.  Love the clean lines of the front end. Best year for hide-away light design.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I like it when they have a little wear & are not all showroom condition. It's just beautiful, it's going to be amazing after you polish it & give it a little tlc!
What a collection you have"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Wow Adam, you really scored with this gorgeous LTD Brougham!!! I'm sure that once you work your magic this black beauty will be stunning!!! I love these late sixties LTDs as I learned how to drive in a 1969 LTD Brougham!!! Thanks for sharing this exciting video!!! üëçüëçüéÑ"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Great color combo and condition. The 68 our family had had pile carpeting like that too. I see the toggle door lock switch on the dash ‚Äî very cool. Love it.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I've been waiting to see this car.  Very nice old girl and I never saw one as loaded.  It would really look nice with the vaned wheel covers that were available at the time.  If you're like me, you'll enjoy the work it takes to bring it back and savor the reward in the finished product.  I wouldn't cry foul if you had the hood and trunk repainted.  The rub through spots will need to be addressed as well as the few places on the trunk.  Still, you'll never find another one as nice with as much equipment or as low mileage.  I look forward to seeing more in future episodes."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Absolute jewel of a car.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"An amazing time capsule! I'd absolutely love to have this car. I'd try to find someone like Adam to refurbish it, though. I know that paint will look great after it's restored to its appropriate luster, but I wouldn't trust myself to do it...not on a car with mileage this low. Thanks for the video."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Nice find and when the weather permits you're going to have a lot of fun polishing and repairing the few minor things to make it perfect.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Very nice car! Looking forward to the virtual ride. As for the Flowmasters, I'd keep em. It sounds great. And I'm sure most of the noise will be kept out of the cabin since those cars were very quiet inside."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Super nice find. 
Citrus based cleaner for the mildew. The ""cool"" factor for this car is thru the roof!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Congratulations Adam! I can‚Äôt wait to see your future video with your LTD reconditioned, I‚Äôm sure it will look and drive amazing!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Beautiful car.  Thanks for sharing it!! Congrats. 10:33 would not recommend super glue since it's so difficult to remove. A regular non-acidic waterproof glue yes.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"What a beautiful car. In the mid 80's a close friend had a 68 LTD and I thought it had to be the best car ever made. It had the 390 2bbl (or was it 2V) and a C6. He abuse that car like there was no tomorrow and it just kept coming back like Christine. He hard a hard time keeping back tires on it, they kept going bald from the torque/burnouts. I really wanted that car when he got tired of it, but alas I took a job several hundred miles away and he ended up selling it to the scrap yard. I just saw another one driving around my town and asked the owner if it was the 390 2bbl and he did confirm it was. I don't think it was the same 68 I remember though. Just saw it today as a matter of fact. Beautiful car you have Adam!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Gorgeous find, Adam. It's going to come out perfect. A bit envious, I must admit. But you have the wherewith all to do it. God bless you for this channel."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,What a marvelous car - congratulations Adam!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Can't wait to see the transformation. The paint will look great when all polished up.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Wow, you lucky SOB! What an excellent specimen you've acquired, color me jealous...And I agree with you on removing the flow-masters mufflers - these are luxury cars that are meant to be seen and NOT heard, so I say rip them off and go with the factory designed mufflers, this car deserves them. I'm also surprised at all of the options on this car too. It looks like it's only missing the cruise control and tilt wheel, but the Cruise units in the Fords of this era aren't very good or accurate at all. Does this have power seats up front? I don't think you mentioned it and there isn't any shot in the video showing the seat controls. And 9900 miles on the clock?! Man, you did great buddy! I will certainly be watching for the video showing the car completely detailed, I have no doubt that the paint will look brand new. Well done sir, well done."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Congrats on an amazing barn find.  Your LTD is a real time machine.  Enjoy it in good health!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I love it! I can't wait to see how it looks after you have cleaned the paint, chrome, and interior. Nice find!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Love those hidden headlights, my favorite 1960's and 1970's car feature."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,That is a freaking SCORE.  Beautiful condition.  Congratulations!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Another great pickup, Adam. I can't actually think of anybody with a comparably great collection of cars from the 60s and 70s like yours. Your collection may well be the finest in the world for this period of vehicles."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Always loved the 67-71 Ford s   My grandfather was a small town Ford dealer from 46-85   I worked for him summers and did many an oil change on this vintage

Great find!!!  Can't wait to see the progress"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"This car is such a beautiful ""Barn find""! I've always loved the exceptionally executed lines on the 1968-1972 LTDS.. They are stunning! My mother had the 1971 Ford LTD during my teen years. It had the 400 engine . This car should polish/cleanup nice."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Nice find Adam. Look forward to seeing the restoration.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"This is the car all of us would love to leave behind to be discovered 60+ years later. A real gem.  Lucky man, are you."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Hi Adam, your taste in cars is impeccable. Classic, uncluttered lines are its strong suite. Perhaps one day you will make a mistake in a purchase, but that day has not come, my friend."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Depending how bad the underside of the air filter housing is, using some JB Weld should be able to close the holes."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Great video Adam, I hope you'll take us through the steps to bring this back as opposed to a simple before and after view."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Is that single stage paint? If so, it's gonna look new when you're done."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,What a diamond in the far-from-rough!  I anxiously look forward to seeing the work you do in order to get it fully operational and roadworthy again.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Very nice! Good to see someone that appreciates these beautiful classics. Thanks for taking good care of them also!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Very nice find! I loved how quickly that 390 started up! FE blocks rock!!!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Congratulations on your newest acquisition, Adam! A sweet ride that will polish out to a real gem!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"This will be a beautiful car once it‚Äôs detailed further.  I always liked this era of Ford LTD, 1968-70.  Ford stylists were quite talented.  I guess most of these cars rusted away due to neglect, but not this one.  Goes to show, proper care can preserve most cars very nicely.  Congratulations on an excellent find and purchase."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Congratulations! What a find. Those were always a favorite of mine as a young boy who loved cars, especially the full size sedans and coupes of the era."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Nice car the factory paid attention to detail back then. Can‚Äôt wait to see what it looks like after you are done with it.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,That is awesome AF!  Truly a once in a lifetime find.   Looks fuel gauge is busted.  Does A/C work?
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"What a find. Good for you Man. True time capsule. I love the way Flowmasters sound on the outside, but they tend to have interior drone. Looking forward to seeing it all cleaned up."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Curious if Grandpa put the flowmasters on or was that maybe a later addition? I love the car. I work for one of the big 3 and it's sad to see what's become of the industry.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"This is the last variation of the 1965-66 Ford dash, and I think it's so much more attractive than the next year.  Beautiful car!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,The experience of appreciating and evaluating the quality and value of a classic car is greatly determined by the enthusiasts attitude toward the brand personality of the car. I am an AM and Pontiac lover now and in my youth. But all classic American cars have an astonishing affect on me now no matter the brand or body style. I have even grown to love station wagons which I had previously loathed.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Great find!  Looking forward to see your planned improvements.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I get a little happier every time you buy a new car for collection, because I know that the car found its way to the one man who will preserve it,  protect it, and make sure  it survives for future generations. 
I love your channel, and thank you for everything you do for the hobby"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"The 68 full size Ford is my favorite. My parents had a  68 country squire that was a wonderful, trouble free car for many years.
Sales were down for this model year. Mostly because of Ford being the use strike target. Also, the 68 cords were a ""build split"" year. That means that they made early and late versions. Extra instrument panel got more padding on later versions. The XL package has the greatest differences between early and late versions because the floor console and bucket seats became a separate option for the XL coupes and convertibles. I aspire to have a 68 ford in the near future."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"beautiful.that was the first car i ever owned when i was 16,would love to have one like this"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,What a beautiful survivor car. Congratulations on another amazing purchase I can‚Äôt wait to see how the restoration work goes.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"My best friend in high school drove the '70 LTD his parents had bought new. It had never been in an accident yet it slowly developed a blotchy rough patch in the paint on the passenger door. What became obvious was that the car was damaged during delivery or at the dealer, then repaired before being sold to  the customer as new.  We found a hefty dent under the body filler when it came time to repaint it. Otherwise, it was a fantastic sar."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"What a great find indeed.  I have no doubt the car will look amazing once you work your magic on that paint.   How could anyone doubt this car has only 9900 miles on it, perhaps they are just envious.  That 390 2V sounds wonderful, even with the flow master exhaust."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Beautiful car. So happy someone is saving these cars.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Geez Adam endless hours on the web and friends finding rides for you is paying off big.
Fantastic LTD Sir.  Cheers üá®üá¶"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Adam, air cleaner replacement. National Parts Depot, they have all kinds of Ford Part's.
This new arrival is a charmer! Can't wait for this LTD make over, lot of work ahead.
Thanks for this content!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Adam you must have a gift for finding these iconic clean cars.  You are the Rescue to all these old timers.  I agreed with the other viewer the exhaust sounds great
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I wonder what the story was about this being parked for so long. Someone obviously went to the time,  money,  and trouble to buy this,  kept it well, but barely used it for what,  a year or two?"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,That is a beautiful car.  The AM/FM was a super rare option at that time.  You are fortunate to have the 390 2 barrel carb.  You can run any gas thru it.  My parents had a 66 LTD Brougham with the 428.  The 428 required aviation fuel almost.  It would ping like crazy on regular.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"That is a beautiful LTD here , 
You do catch the treasures there Adam , well done 
That exhaust is not too loud , 
might be a little worse at styeady highway cruising though 
I like the pre 1974, cars from the big 3 , those 
Pontiacs you have are nice , that 2 door Catalina is a fine car , 
Keep 'em coming !"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Amazing car, Adam.    I think you have a very early production 1968 car.   I say this because my Dad ordered a 1968 Ford Torino GT fastback and it was built in 1967 before the start of the new year.  It did not have head rests on the bucket seats.   These were low back buckets which during the rest of the 1968 model year had head rests added to comply with Federal Safety regulations.    Just a thought.    Once again you 'rescue' a car that many would not give a second thought and would have been abused as a 'beater' car.    You will give it the respect it deserves and that is a wonderful car for your collection!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I love it!  Nice LTD. Consider showing some videos of you reconditioning it, not just the finished product."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Even with the patina it seems a very solid car. Always liked the '68 LTD best, probably due to the one year only front with hideaway lamps. Congrats on reaching 80k subscribers, now on to 100k! üëç"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"What a fantastic find and I agree it does look like a 9K mile car. One of my favorite Fords is the 68 LTD/XL, the grill/hideaway headlights really look great. I had a 69 Country Squire with a 390 2bbl which ran great on regular gas, one of Fords better idea's."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Wonderful car! I hope you keep the original standard wheel covers. In my opinion, they look better on the '68 LTD than the finned deluxe wheel covers do."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Unbelievable, what a treasure you found! I am in the area, I'd love to take a ride, I'll drop everything for a ride!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Adam, Dang!  When I grow up I want to be you lol!  I‚Äôm actually much older than you ‚Ä¶ I was 13 when this latest beauty of yours rolled off the assembly line, but back in the day I became more enamored with the big-3‚Äôs larger big body ‚Äúnear luxury‚Äù models like this gorgeous and so rare LTD Brougham than I was with the mid-sized ‚Äòmuscle‚Äô cars of that era that grab so much more attention these days.  Brougham trim package pushed pricing closer to Lincoln  land and the main reason so few were produced.  Thousands more pedestrian LTD‚Äôs produced with crank windows and AM radios etc for every one of these. And triple-black to boot?  Be still my heart. Power plant upgrade to 390-4V or 429 only option that would make this a little sweeter, but this car is no less stunning and a real head turner. Congrats on the ‚Äòscore‚Äô and look forward to seeing how it looks after you‚Äôve had a chance to show it some Adam love!  Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Love your channel!
I really enjoyed your series of videos interviewing GM designers.  Have you thought about reaching out to former Ford or Chrysler designers?"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Adam awesome content as always but I can't help myself to point out that you should REALLY consider having someone remove that sock and any type of asbestos of the engine bay.I think you should know this but asbestos has been found since a long time ago that its not really good for your lung/respiratory health. And this should go for your other classic cars as well as it was a effective  material for things like head gaskets to more prominently brake shoes/drums. It was also used extensively in homes but that's whole another story.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Cool.  I do like the ""up close and personal"" product review type of videos that you do."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Great car! My best friend‚Äôs Dad had a Country Squire! So smooth, lots of room.  I well remember that dashboard.  Adam, do you ever say to yourself that something in your collection has got yo go to make room for new cars?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"These were sharp looking cars.
I like the Chrome Trimmed Windows.
That was always a good look on cars back then."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,This is bittersweet.  My dad's dark highland green '68 LTD 2dr 390 was a terrific car with great build quality.  I always thought that the Fords had it well over it's competition this year.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Fantastic 68 LTD!  Looking forward to your refurbishment videos Adam!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Check your motor mounts for dry rot. These Fords were famous for popping into reverse at high idle when they were cold. If the motor mounts are weak they will allow the engine to shift slightly upward on one side which would pull the shift linkage, allowing it to pop into reverse. Be really careful about that good motor mounts or not. Back in the day I‚Äôve seen several times when one popped in the reverse on its own."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,So glad it found a good home. The majority of that will polish up well.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Another fine acquisition Adam 
I don't think I would repaint it 
As they say it's only original once I'm sure it would clean up very nicely 
I googled Lucas motors and they are still a Ford dealer here in New Jersey"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"I bought my first car in 1981 and it was a 1968 Ford Galaxie 500 4 door. I wish I still had it today. You scored big time!
Some might say preserve it and put it in a museum. I say just the opposite drive it enjoy it and put as many miles on it as you possibly can. Consider the prior owners good caretakers and they saved it for YOU!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Love the 390 one of the best Ford engines...not a Ford guy at all but I can respect older ones like this. My grandma had a 69 ltd
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Absolutely incredible that any cars are in this condition, and that you are the owner of ""many"" of them!üèÅ Most cars at 5 years into their existence, are in far worse condition. Another big score. Congratulations."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,I detailed cars for many years. I have my doubts on the condition of the paint. I do know though that the Ford acrylic enamel will come back much better than the GM acrylic lacquer. The car probably came from the factory with single exhaust. I don‚Äôt believe that Ford even offered duals as an option with that engine.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Very nice find. Can't wait to see you fix it up, polish and drive it... probably after the bad weather goes away."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Adam, be sure to swap out the rear 6x9 speakers in the back with some big-magnet replacements (at the right ohms)...Your radio will sound like Carnegie Hall, trust me!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Wow - that car will be a GEM with a week or two of elbow grease! Perfect time of year to putter with it - pull it in the garage, bump up the heat, and watch the snowflakes fall outside while you give this beautiful old girl some love!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Wow...amazing find...that would be a fantastic daily retro driver.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"As a kid, my family drove Pontiacs, Oldsmobile,  AMC Rambler station wagon, and a Ford Pinto station wagon, which was safer than the 2 door to be in‚Ä¶.

 But I like this LTD. It looks like it‚Äôs in amazing shape and all it needs is a good cleaning inside and out.

Great find."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Enjoy your newest classic Adam.  Can't wait to see it after you have finished detailing it.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Can't wait to see it polished up!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,what a find  . the keys are perfect  like they have never been used
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Lucas Ford is still in business in Burlington Nj I went there as a kid with my father looking for a ltd or something similar, he ended up buying a 69 Torino fast back from a dealership in philly that's also still there. Great cars great memories!"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Wow, you did it this time. Sweet find, love it."
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Nice find! Did you secure that alternater in the trunk? I learned the hard way about dimpling the quarter panel with my tool box sliding in the trunk. Try some Mop&Glo on a test vinyl top that is clean and dry. Sponge it on and leave it to dry. Beautimus!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,"Time capsule ! What a treat ! Great score ! Well done , well done"
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,I love those shoulder belts folded against the ceiling. As I recall I had a Mercury Montego with the same setup.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,nice car. my uncle had a two door ltd with hidden headlights. those other people don't realize odometer don't over turn over.
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Dad bought a 1970 LTD in 1972. Midnight blue with med blue interior.  It was a beautiful car.  Many people thought it was a Continental !!!   This 68 is a real treasure.  Much better materials then the 69-70. From there they slowly got decontented as far as quality and little details.  This one will be a gem all cleaned up!
2,ZK8R-LhM1LM,Beautiful car! What an awesome find!!

10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"This band still knows how to tug at my heartstrings here and there, and when they do it's always very touching. Great track, stoked for Winter"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,The song ends with a cats meow on the Spotify version and it's the greatest small detail ever
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"When rivers is on, nobody can touch him as a songwriter. Not everything he writes is amazing, but a song like this comes around and nobody comes close to writing something this incredible. He really does remind me of Brian Wilson."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"This one was beautiful. It‚Äôs so great to see us dogs getting some respect. I wonder if this song was inspired by my owner finding me at the kennel and giving me a new life, one full of stunts, Weeziness, partying, and crapping on The Guy from Maladroit‚Äôs lawn. Welp, time to go cry in a corner before I get back to partying. 

Also Fun fact: all the dogs in this video are my whole extended family. It was nice to see cameos from my nephew Buster, and apparently my uncle Koku√¥ started a Weezer cover band with cousin Coda. Y‚Äôall are gonna go far! I also loved the appearances from aunt Molly, my weird cousin Jack Jack who‚Äôs currently in South America searching for the ancient artifact known as Songs from the Black Hole, and of course, the head of the family, Grandpa Sweater Song. I can‚Äôt wait to see them all this Christmas and try getting them into Raditude again. Keep it Weezy and don‚Äôt stop partying! -Sidney"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,the harmonies on this song are absolutely insane. cant wait for winter
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Can't wait to listen to SZNZs from Spring to Winter and then do it again!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Weezer doing some psychedelics and realizing that dogs are man's best friend and they are special and amazing
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Here we go, baby!!  
This is some straight up classic Weezer üëêüèº
5 thousand stars!!! A+"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. That bass, solo, and the way rivers says I want a dog are all incredible"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Wow! Instrumentals are phenomenal. This reminds me very much of Queen, one of my all time favorite bands. Harmonies, all vocals, are spot on. Lyrically, I'll have whateve Rivers had prior to writing this inevitable classic! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
 ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Weezer this is a master piece üòÆ. it has the same 90s sound as pinkerton‚Äôs album yet it‚Äôs a really nice vocal touch. Can‚Äôt wait for the rest of the album to come out, keep it up Rivers!!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,SZNS has progressively gotten better with every release. I‚Äôm so excited to hear Winter!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,I lost my dog earlier this year. She was just shy of 14. I'm crying listening to this. I miss her so much.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Truly one of the most beautiful tracks you‚Äôve put out in a while. Thank you beyond words. Can‚Äôt wait to hear this EP.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"This album will truly rock and I know it, thank you for being with me since elementary school guys!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,If my daughter hears this I'm screwed.  I don't want a dog. She really really does. She'll use this song against me.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Singing Weezer songs growing up helped me get over my stutter, I love these guys so much üòÅ"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,The vocals are amazing. Feels so good and nostalgic to hear
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"If the rest of the album is as good as this, I‚Äôm really excited, and somewhat confident that this may turn out to be the best SZN (already been listening to this constantly since it dropped). Can‚Äôt wait for the full release!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"weezer is still putting out bangers after all these years, its awesome."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Why you gotta do this to me, Weezer! I just lost my absolute best friend in the whole stinkin‚Äô world recently and you release this gem. ‚ù§"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Easily one of the weezer songs of all time, great stuff all around."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Love a delicious midnight snack. Love a midnight Weezer treat even more! Thanks boys!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Winter is shaping up to be amazing üôå
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Love it Weezer you did great here
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Weezer - never stop making music. Well, maybe. But, might as well go for 37 albums at this point."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Amazing track! This is the classic Weezer sound we all love. Plus, who doesn't love dogs? Excellent across the board. =w="
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Amazing, just when I thought Weezer was the greatest thing ever. They top themselves!!!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This was great! I'm so excited for Winter! I hope it'll be as stellar as Autumn
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"This is Rivers so doing Rivers, stuffing 5,6 mini movements in a 3-minute song. It‚Äôs cute, it‚Äôs loud, it‚Äôs dramatic, it‚Äôs nerdy, whatever, but it‚Äôs another showcase of his insane talent for melodies and super catchy hooks.
Make sure to listen to the very last second for a‚Ä¶ twist?"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Dang Weezer this is beautiful and quite epic and sad at the same time!!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I like that this feels more like classic Weezer, or at least more than Spring did. I hope we can get more of that in Winter!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"this is so unexpected damn love it because its so random, sad (or more dramatic) and happy at the same time"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,I‚Äôm gonna go insane trying not to listen to this in full until the entire EP comes outüò¢
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"To the people holding out to hear the official release of winter take it from a guy who enjoyed the live winter bootleg it's gonna be fantastic so much meaningful deep profound lyrics by rivers alot of change ups catchy melodies and now I've heard the first single, and production, it's gonna be one of my favorite weezer albums"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Weezer never fails to amaze ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•ü´∂
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Rivers cuomo is our generations brian wilson unique unafraid to try new styles of music the guys 52 married two kids and he's out there making some of his best music his vocals are better than ever sznz has been so cool and to know they have been recording these albums in real time while touring is just unbelievable congratulations weezer you deserve to be inducted into the rock n roll hall of fame next year and I hope you know how much your fans appreciate what you do for us # weezer fan 4 life
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Gives greatest man that ever lived vibes
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This song is legitimately amazing.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"rivers, you ok? you know, you're a famous rockstar, you can get as many dogs as you want. but, in all seriousness, this is pretty good! idk what i was expecting, but this was a pleasant surprise!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,These SZNZ tracks just keep sneaking up on me. Great track sounds like classic Weezer and also perfectly matches the winter season
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one. Also crying my eyes out while huggig my dog"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,It‚Äôs going to be sad to see this szns era end. I‚Äôm ready for some new Weezer every few months
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"They are the best group I ever listened to. River is really doing a good job, I really can't wait for the rest of the album."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I don't know how can anyone ever hate Weezer. You might not like their song, but it is impossible to hate them. They're just wholesome."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"WOOW! I LOVE THIS SONG! 
BRAZIL LOVES WEEZER"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This song is giving me some Blue album and Pinkerton vibes and I‚Äôm not complaining. Great song!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Gifted again by Weezer. Two of my favorite things- Weezer and dogs. Perfect
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Est√° canci√≥n hizo que extra√±ara much√≠simo a mi reci√©n mejor amigo fallecido, Bruno üê∂"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Winter starts very well with this beautiful gem
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I love the simplicity of this lyrics. I needed this, in a world full of overthinking, of over-communicating, of worrying about saying the right thing. I also want a dog‚Ä¶"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"It‚Äôs beautiful. Listening to it again and again while cuddling with my sweet Sheprador, Miso üêï ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I thought it said ‚Äútrapped in my body and my own mind‚Äù. Also, great song! My second fav SZNZ song so far!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Listening to this song makes me feel incredibly great feeling! thank you so much weezer for that song! you all from band my inspiration in life, thank for your great music that makes me feel great and sometimes even gives me confidence, thank you again for that great song!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This is honestly very beautiful and I‚Äôm really excited for the last szns album
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I wish, they would take the best songs of each ep and call the album ""Seasons"". It would be a great piece of music!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Only reason I‚Äôm looking forward to Winter is because of this album
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,I‚Äôm a little sad that SZNZ is almost overüò¢
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Rivers came along about 20 years too late. Had he been around in the 60's-1970's his songs would have been FAR more popular. No one these days can put out a great melody after great melody like Rivers. Are there some stinkers here and there? Yes of course, but the bulk of his work is amazing. He kinda reminds me of the current generations Paul McCartney. Unfortunately the kids of today don't really understand good song writing or musicianship."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"I love this song and this video is so cool and weird! It feels like blue album, EWBAITE, and ok human. It's so awesome"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This song made me hug my dog a little harder this morning...great track as always
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Last few Weezer albums have been atrocious but this song sounds like the Weezer I fell in love with
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Can't wait to see what kind of limited release y'all do for the whole sznz
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Perfect mix of new era and Blue era in my opinion.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This might be my favorite Weezer song since the stuff on The Blue Album. Amazing!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"My favorite sznz song by far, really reminds me of Pinkerton's no other one"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,The single has a meow at the end and you get the sense he‚Äôs sitting with his cat just seething with disdain.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Best birthday present ever. Crying and taking my dog out for a run
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Coolest song about being a pet owner.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Love the final strum at the end along with rivers ohhh
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,after hearing the cat meow at the end i like to believe this song is about rivers getting a cat and regretting he didn't get a dog instead
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,finally a truly classic weezer song
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Dark enough to see the stars is my favorite on the album
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Why does it sound like a Christmas classic and it‚Äôs not even about Christmas 
I absolutely love it"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Thank you For Being In My Life Weezer.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,So hyped for sznz winter. I love weezer
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,My fan boy is coming out!! This is amazing!!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"These guys will seemingly never get the magic back they had when Matt Sharp was in the band.

A lot of people still like them though and they‚Äôve had a successful career so God Bless them."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"Wonderful, a brand new Wizzo, absolutely exquisite"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This song is so adorable
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This song made me want a dog. üêï
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"BRUH, WHEN THAT FIRST DROP HAPPENED, MY JAW DROPPED"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This was so fun and trippy. Good job
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Love it! üíôüêï
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,I just want to know the total quantity of Weezer songs at this point...
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,This is really sweet
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"You All Guys are good to makes Us wowing, time after time.
Thank You!!!!!"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,possibly the best song from all the sznz albums thus far
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Rivers truly loves making music this was so sweet and random
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,i love weezer
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,WEEZER„ÅÆÂàùÊúü„ÅÆÊõ≤„ÅÆÈõ∞Âõ≤Ê∞ó„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„Å¶Â•Ω„Åç
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,I'm so excited for SZNZ Winter!!!!
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,ITS SO GOOD
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"No joke, I had this acid trip back in 1998. I was lying in a field in rural Oklahoma thinking about famous dogs. How‚Äôd you time warp into my brain vault? What a bizarre feeling."
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,"this is 90s weezer, alright. damn rivers wasnt lying this is awesome"
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,Goddamn was not expecting this to be so good.
10,BcjmEOby3Vc,There are two popular songs called ‚ÄúI Want a Dog‚Äù and this is the second best one

10,mUQlsyNixpA,"Matt and Mylene's voices together are amazing, along with the song. I got to know the band thanks to three songs: Uprising (heard a lot on the radios in my city at the time of release), The Butterflies and Hurricanes (because I played F1 05 a lot) and the Supermassive Black Hole (because I played Fifa 07). At the time I didn't know that all three were made by Muse, but now after more 3 years of discovering and becoming a fan, I can finally enjoy all the albums, now at 23 years old.

10,5ojQWUSxums,Phew! Finally! Christmas is not Christmas without Leo's Christmas song!üî• Dangerous-brutal cool-metal Santa!üé∏‚ö°üéÖüî•

10,5ojQWUSxums,This dude never misses! Such a dude! ü§üüèº
10,5ojQWUSxums,Why can't all Christmas songs be like this love to hear copperhead road by Steve Earle ‚ù§
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Leo you're the best artist i discovered for years. You made me listen to far more music than i ever would listen to on my own. 
You're versions are always heavy as f*ck and spot on en still recognize the original song. 
You deserve a statue ü§òü§ò,"
10,5ojQWUSxums,Always love your metal renditions of holiday standards. Would love B52s Rock Lobster ü¶û!
10,5ojQWUSxums,This guys so talented ü§òü§ò
10,5ojQWUSxums,Now I feel the Christmas spirit!

10,5ojQWUSxums,Merry Christmas from Texas! would love to see a Dolly Parton - 9-5 cover under my tree :)

10,5ojQWUSxums,"i would love to see a cover of charol of the bells done like this, i feel the it would lend itself well to metal"
10,5ojQWUSxums,"I had to unlike this so I could like it twice.  Holy shit, man.  Good job."
10,5ojQWUSxums,"My son has been making me nuts with the Burl Ives version so we're definitely gonna switch it up with this one! Merry Christmas, Leo! üéÑ"
10,5ojQWUSxums,Finally a version that's doesn't get annoying lol love it
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Now it‚Äôs Christmas and it‚Äôs time to be honest: Leo Moracchioli is a legend. That‚Äôs it. 
He is a 360 degree artist. Indeed also Rabea, which‚Äôs is on the way to be a legend, is playing guitar with Frog Leap. 
I can spend another 2000MB words on Mr. Moracchioli. 
I am such a fun that, with my cover band, I would like to make Leo‚Äôs covers. Which is a bit a white rabbit‚Äôs hole. 
Unfortunately I can‚Äôt find Leo on any magazine. And that‚Äôs sad. 
I wish you only the best. Because that‚Äôs what you really deserve"
10,5ojQWUSxums,I know what I'll be blasting Christmas day again üòÇ. My wife is a huge Nightmare Before Christmas fan as well as Polar Express. I'm sure she would love your take on 1 of the songs from those movies.
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Now, THIS is a Christmas SongüòÅ
IT's FUN ü§™not boringüòÆ‚Äçüí®"
10,5ojQWUSxums,What I love is he's looking like he's having a blast playing it every video he's done!
10,5ojQWUSxums,Always look forward to hearing Leo's Xmas covers!
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Merry Christmas Leo! Another awesome cover as usual!! Just one question though. Why does Santa look like a corpse? Lol!
I'd ask love to hear you cover Devo's Time Out For Fun! Pretty please with sugar plums on top? üéÑüßë‚ÄçüéÑ"
10,5ojQWUSxums,Only Leo can make a Christmas song better than the original
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Merry Xmas everyone, Love u Leo even my kids listen to you they 6 and 9 years old \m/"
10,5ojQWUSxums,"When I see these videos - after my jaw has closed & admiration subdued; my brain thinks....how???!!!
1. Pick a song
2. Plan the music
3. Plan which instruments
4. Plan which notes for which instruments 
5. Plan costume & free/ tied beard & weirdo-contacts & act
6) play each instrument separately & record video
7) edit audio & video - 1 seamless & continuous enjoyable, creative metal banger
8) post on YT & wait for comments
9) reply comments
10) plan next songüòÖ"
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Leo this is Leo asking for a Christmas album or compilation.  I could listen to Christmas classics all day if they were rocked up like this.  I guess this proves ""Ask and you shall receive"""
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Merry x-mas Leo, great cover as always. My suggestion is Michael Jackson they don't care about us extra dark and hard."
10,5ojQWUSxums,"Happy Holidays to you Leo, the family, and everyone at Frog Leap Studios!!!"
10,5ojQWUSxums,Love it when you sing in your non-metal singing voice.

10,5ojQWUSxums,"No but let me write a bit more‚Ä¶

Best riff of the year was Silver Tongue. Chapeau. I mean: Alter Bridge. 
But why Mr. Moracchioli is not in the list? Talking about riffs, he is freaking good. He is the Riffmeister.  Isn‚Äôt it? And the concerts are quite full. Am I wrong?

There is a lot of effort in what he is doing.
He deserves a first place in a category alone, like EVH."

10,WrEoMdbvLXA,"Just back from your concert in Rome today. You are incredible, Luca! I've never seen someone play like you, and I've seen my fair share of great artists, luckily. Amazing show, some pieces left me in awe. ""Round Thing"", the one you dedicated to your wife, was not as flashy and technically challenging as the others, but it was so sweet and emotional, a true love song, despite the funny name you acknowledged haha. Thanks for signing ""Blue"" at the end. Daje tutta!"
10,WrEoMdbvLXA,Love it! This will forever be the first Song I uploaded a cover of. Truly a great piece  and you did it justice!
10,WrEoMdbvLXA,He is playing a piano with the guitar look at his hands...so wonderful so beautiful
10,WrEoMdbvLXA,Inspiring as always Luca! Can't wait to see you live again!
10,WrEoMdbvLXA,"Luca, you are absolutely fantastic! Sometimes you do a song I have never heard (like this one) so I will go listen to the original to compare. Your covers ALWAYS blow the originals away. Not only do I really enjoy your music, but I LOVE to watch your videos and I rewatch them over and over again. Some day I hope I will be able to see you on tour. Thank you for sharing your wonderful talent."

10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Ese charango en Sante suena hermoso, cada que la escucho me da ganas de bailar.
 Instrumentos andinos en canciones internacionales, por eso amo a Stromae ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Thank you for the introduction to this unique artist. As a man struggling with dark thoughts and not having encountered Stromae before, I was taken aback by the raw honesty and delivery of topics which if popular media is to be believed, are being addressed more openly and with less judgment. I have not been lucky enough to find such an open avenue here in the USA. It‚Äôs interesting that this music seems to resonate with so many"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Lo amo y amo lo que hace,  de verdad que siempre me sorprende todo ese talento y esa manera tan aut√©ntica de regalarnos su alegr√≠a"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"For those who don't understand french, Stromae's lyrics are a very good reason to learn it. They are just as powerful or even more than the music."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Que artista! Sempre entrega coisas maravilhosas de se ouvir. Merci pour votre art, Stromae!"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Stromae es uno de los artistas m√°s completos actualmente su m√∫sica realmente es sorprendente. Se merece muchisimo m√°s reconocimiento por su arte.
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Wow! So lovely to see Strome on Tiny Desk after all these years! Stromae has built an incredible career of artistry and showmanship. He's such a phenomenal story teller. His lyrics, music videos, concerts all demonstrate unmatched thought and care. Very excited that he's back."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Gracias Stromae por volver, por tocarnos, por sensibilizarnos, por recordarnos que somos tan humanos todos........m√∫sica que nos conecta, que nos inspira. Sigue alegr√°ndonos con tu arte, con tu gran sensibilidad social y con esa multiculturalidad maravillosa que tiene tu m√∫sica......."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Stromae has to be one of the best artists that has ever existed. He's very talented, charismatic and kind. A very special human being indeed."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"stromae siempre me parece irreal en sus presentaciones, es demasiado artista ‚ù§"

10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Wow! I hope NPR audience appreciates the blessing it is to have Stromae. Probably one of the greatest artist of the 21st century. 1. Melody. 2. Sounds to match exact mood of the song 3. Thought provoking lyrics. 4. Stage creativity. 5. Video clip creativity 6. Costume creativity.
Merci Stromae de continuer de cr√©er et de nous sortir de nos limites qu‚Äôon se met en grandissant inconsciemment."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Stromae always makes sure every member of his team is seen and applauded for. A fantastic musician who treats his crew and band members with respect, while boasting an enthusiastic and downright infectious subtle charisma. Can't beat it!"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Saludos desde Colombia. Que bonita m√∫sica! @Stromae
10,6dkDepLX0rk,como brasileira morando na belgica e tendo conhecido esse cara indo parar num show dele: DO CARALHO!!!!
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Love to see his big smile. He's such an example for those of us who struggle/ have struggled with depression.
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Can't get over this concert. Love Stromae so much and each one of the crew members. They make such a perfect team!! Thanks for this Tiny Desk!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

10,6dkDepLX0rk,Such a treat! The thing I love the most about Stromae and his on stage presence is how he can shift from one character to another according to what song he's performing at
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"La grande classe!! Quel talent...les paroles, le personnage. Merci Stromae"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Stromae is such a unique artist. His presentation, his fashion, his lyrics are incredibly interesting and poetic. I love that Tiny Desk Concert is doing these more international shows too. Love this!"

10,6dkDepLX0rk,"I love Stromae, it's so nice to see him come back. I wish Tiny Desk Concerts were a thing back in the day so we would have artists like Lauryn Hill. I love this, great job Stromae."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"He really is the embodiment of the word ARTIST.
You are very loved here on  üáßüá∑ Stromae."

10,6dkDepLX0rk,"I love Stromae so much. I can't believe I only came across his music last year. I enjoy his live performances,  always filled with emotion. L'enfer  Formidable, Sante and Papaoutai are my favorites"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"So happy to see Stromae on Tiny Desk, as a Belgian myself, you can't imagine how loved and idolized he is all over our usually divided country! He's been internationally loved  since forever of course, but it still feels nice to see his actual skills and lyricism highlighted and respected by this Tiny Desk! Paul's a real maestro"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,This feels like a Christmas gift! This is who I ever wanted on Tiny Desk Concert :)
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Saw a clip from here on Twitter and was captivated. Stromae is so wonderfully talented and I‚Äôm glad to have found his music. 

Tiny desk, you are doing important and impressive work. Thank you"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Stumbled into his live set at Coachella this year. Ended up being my favorite set of the entire festival. Don't speak a lick of french but his music and performance are such a vibe. Earned a lifelong fan.
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"I love how he recognizes and takes time to credit the other musicians. That is SUPER important, and it just shows how respectful and conscious he is, and that makes his music even more soulful"

3. One of my fav tiny desks! Great perf! Huge fan now!"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Thank you Tiny Desk for introducing this amazing music into my ears! I'd never heard Stromae before! <3
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Ohh as a French learner saying you like Stromae is such a classic. But how can you not say so? He makes such a creative music with thoughtful lyrics. I love him for not talking about how he's rich and talented. I love him for singing about his deep emotions and thoughts. He's a true poet.
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"He doesn't take success for granted, he's a true artist, and never ceases to amaze me (alongside his musicians of course). This acapella version of 'Mon amour' is so beautiful"
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"Stromae is a genius. I saw him and his ensemble at Rock Werchter in 2014. Pretty much the best act I've ever seen in my life. And, Stromae (Paul van Haver) seems like an absolutely lovely person."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Gracias NPR por traer a Stromae a Tiny Desk :D
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"I had the pleasure to see him live in concert the same week he recorded this Tiny Desk in DC and he was absolutely phenomenal! Even though I don‚Äôt know French, you can tell when an artist is very serious and passionate about their art. I am so elated that I got to see him live. He really put on a show that I will never forget."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,Literalmente m√∫sica pros meus ouvidos ü•Ç‚ô•Ô∏è
10,6dkDepLX0rk,I'm obsessed with Stromae. He's so refreshingly original. What a voice! What a smile!

10,6dkDepLX0rk,I really like Stromae songs.. He is such incredible artist.. Even I didnt understand French but I really enjoy it
10,6dkDepLX0rk,He is so interesting! I'm always fascinated with all of the things he come up with!  He's just on a league of his own. <3

10,6dkDepLX0rk,There's only one problem with this video: It ends! I would love to hear every single song from his last album here on Tiny Desk! Amazing as usual guys!
10,6dkDepLX0rk,"I only knew one of his songs until the other night, and now I wanna listen to more after this, so I also didn't know anything really about him at all. I already like this voice, but his personality appears to be very loveable and that always draws me into wanting to know about someone. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and I'll make sure to listen to his other songs when I can."
10,6dkDepLX0rk,known him for years and so thankful I learned French in High School. I can understand and sing along with his music ‚ô• Love you King Stromae

10,cYpBz7ocKhc,I admire Bob Dylan's ability to hold you a willing hostage. What a wizard. üéºüñ§
10,cYpBz7ocKhc,"Awh..this song touches my heart!!! Does Bob know how incredibly sweet he is and does he know how blessed we are with all his precious gifts? Feel more respect than for anyone i've ever known...It talks about a pain deeply felt, but true love is always, always (!) forgiving, un-judgmental, and forever üíúüôè!!!"
10,cYpBz7ocKhc,"I have this CD. It's great. Bob Dylan's Nashville phase with John Wesley Harding is a really profound era in his music. It's more sparse lyrically, and instrumentally, and his singing is becoming more like crooning. From there, he would go into an incredible country music phase with Nashville Skyline, and Self Portrait. His crooning voice remained for those two albums. Bob Dylan is definitely hard to match, when it comes to songwriting. You cannot get any better than that, in modern music. There is a small number of other artists who come close, one being Leonard Cohen, but Bob Dylan is still in a league of his own. Cheers to all the fans of Bob Dylan, from around the world! ‚úåÔ∏è"

Alive as you or me

Tearing through these quarters

In the utmost misery

With a blanket underneath his arm

And a coat of solid gold

Searching for the very souls

Whom already have been sold



‚ÄúArise, arise,‚Äù he cried so loud

In a voice without restraint

‚ÄúCome out, ye gifted kings and queens

And hear my sad complaint

No martyr is among ye now

Whom you can call your own

So go on your way accordingly

But know you‚Äôre not alone‚Äù



I dreamed I saw St. Augustine

Alive with fiery breath

And I dreamed I was amongst the ones

That put him out to death

Oh, I awoke in anger

So alone and terrified

I put my fingers against the glass

And bowed my head and cried"

10,cYpBz7ocKhc,"John Wesley Hardin : the music and the songstructure is reduced to the max and the content of the songs  explodes in your head. Everybody wants to make an album like Blonde on Blonde , wants to be like the liquid mercury , psychedelic Dylan and he himself got enough of it. May be the reason is an accident, the wish to live a privat life with family,   or a burn out- nobody knows. But Dylan is looking for new land born in silence and thinking all over. The strictly tacting of the beat developes a new foundation , the thoughts can start to fly. The poetical magic of 'St. Augustin' and "" All along the watchtower "" can grow. Jimi Hendrix   understood and showed him his respect. This album is light as a feather but can open up your mind, because it containes multitudes of world explanation pattern. And by the way it sound great"

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"Gosh that Santa Fury Frreak lyric is gold. I laughed immediately. A majority of the lyrics feel like they were Rocket's idea mainly the Santa's demise, Flamethrower,  stab out Santa's eyes and missle lyrics. Plus Groot jamming to the song is hilarious"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"My gosh, they have skill! And those prosthetics, designs and outfits are beautiful. Great work! üëèüèºüëèüèº"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"The single greatest Christmas song ever made. I usually dread Christmas music, but if department stores were playing this banger I would find myself doing a lot more shopping."
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"Quill's face when ''Mrs. Claus, she works the Pole'' is an underrated moment."
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"By itself the song is a great bop to listen to, but seeing it context with Quill‚Äôs bewilderment, vibing Groot, and the audience‚Äôs bafflement makes it a million times better.

What makes it more amusing is that in the Marvel comics themselves, Santa is apparently real and is one of the most powerful super-beings of all time, allegedly Omega level Mutant."
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVER!
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Old 97‚Äôs!!!  So catchy.  My kids love it.  ‚ÄúI Am Groooooot!‚Äù

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"this is genuinely the most unexpected song that I enjoyed so much lately, and fortunately it is from the MCUüòä‚ù§"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Thanks James Gunn for the best 2022 song. Do whatever you want with DC Studios.

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,I was surprised when i watched the special and this started. definatlly the best christmas song ive heard in a good while.
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,The way the guitarist spins his arm is just hypnotizing to me..
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,This song goes down as a Christmas classic imo. I know it's already on my playlist.

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"I love this! Creativity at its best, I laughed so much. Probably my favorite Christmas song and Disney short!"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"I'm with starlord, the song actual gets ""kinda cool"" at the chorus haha! I love the melody when they sing the titular line"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"Idk about you out this song is banging! Such creative lyrics makes it so special, and the singers voice is perfect üëçüèª"

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"Santa sounds like a great guy. Something tells me this song will be a classic song and a traditional one now.

Also, he has a flamethrower? I didn‚Äôt know that. üòÖ"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Can we give a shoutout to the production crew on this? Makeup and camera work and audio is all awesome!
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,I shall play this at Christmas time every year
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"My favourite christmas song honestly, love itü•∞"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,I really hope this isn't accurately describing a variant of Santa somewhere in the multiverse... üò¨üòÇüòÖ
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,This is a certified christmas classic now
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Maybe it‚Äôs just the fan boy part of me but I must confess it‚Äôs actually a pretty darn good song that deserves some credit
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,That crowd was not the audience at all (except Groot)! That song was awesome!
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Why was the crowd hating it? This song is great.
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Def should check out their Xmas album ... Gotta love music from Texas .. old 97s .. look em up

10,-E1ULv6LcOk,I'm gonna miss the Guardians if the next movie is the last time we see them. And if not its certainly going to be strange seeing them without James Gunn at the helm because he has such a distinct tone compared to the rest of the MCU
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Amazing!!! üéâ
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,"I love that my fave band is now in the MCU ‚Ä¶ as aliens, but still!"

I'm not joking! Look it up!"
10,-E1ULv6LcOk,Groot walking into frame in complete awe is amazing!

10,Oh8b_P7_AuA,"In terms of video production his crew is on Kendrick video crew level, the shit that he do has always some kind of concept and even if the idea is not very fresh he displays it in such a unique and interesting way that it's complementary to vocals and watching video seems necessary to fully capture this song meaning. This is amazing Experience"

10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Give Dylan and Sadie an award. They deserve it. Their acting was not cringe and they both did well.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Taylor's directing skills, Sadie and Dylan's acting skills WOW give them all the awards already."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Damn seeing Taylor direct is awesome but seeing Sadie be directed and the way she responds to what she's given and how she acts upon it is literal magic, that's impressive"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,17 year's in her music career and she's still shining bright like a diamond üíé. What a legend Taylor has become!
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,The respect I have for Dylan and Sadie as actors. Like that must have been an uncomfortable thing for them to do but they put their professionalism before it and told a story. Truly remarkable. Amazing job to them and Taylor as a director
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Fun fact: We all agree that Taylor not only is a great musician, singer and artist but an awesome director."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"The emotional trauma she must have had in order to still remember every detail, I‚Äôm sure she took creative liberty to the ones she don‚Äôt remember, is so sad yet so amazing to see her be able to move past it now"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"taylor, sadie and dylan all deserve awards. taylor‚Äôs directing was IMPECCABLE and sadie and dylan‚Äôs acting was absolutely GORGEOUS !!"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I love that this introduced so many people to short-film and short-film making. It's an underestimadted art form.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"""She's fine but-but she's not who we met""
""we're watching a person come of age""
""and it was my foot!""
Are my favorite quotes from this video truly an incredible life changing artist"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,The fact that Sadie can instantly act upon what was said is amazing. I can't wait to see how far she can go. She is such a talented actress.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I think the reason this song always connected so much for everyone is that everyone has this sort of universal experience. Everyone has that first adult relationship, generally  between 18 and 22, that we think is just the be all and end all of our lives. It's different from your high school crushes and relationships. We jump in fully uninhibited because  we were still young and naive enough to believe in fairytale happy endings and that love is going to be easy and it's never going to hurt and you see your whole future in that person...just for it to inevitably come crashing down. And when it's happening at that age, with everything still brand new to you, it feels like you are the only person on the planet who has ever felt that strongly before, no one can possibly understand your devastation...it feels like the entire universe has lied to you somehow. And it DOES change you forever, in positive and negative ways.

Everyone has that one person they think of when they hear this song, and it makes all your personal memories with them come flooding back. And THAT is why I truly believe this is one of the greatest songs ever written. I feel like there aren't that many songs out there that can perfectly capture such a universal experience so perfectly and personally."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Am√© ver el detras de camaras! Porque demuestra el gran trabajo, pasion y dedicacion que Taylor le pone a lo que hace!.. esto solo me hace amarla mas! What a queen she is!! Very talented!ü§©ü§©üòçüòç"

10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Taylor's enthusiasm on every perfected scene can keep me going
Not so many artists give their whole like Taylor does...I love it, stage, video, interview or directing even meeting fans....."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Claim your ‚Äúhere within an hour‚Äù ticket right here üèÜ
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,i feel like taylor couldn‚Äôt have picked anyone better than sadie and dylan to play these roles. they made the story and song come to life with their amazing acting and i just think everything about this short film is absolutely beautiful.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Te amo, eres una artista completa e incre√≠ble y me emociona vivir en la misma √©poca que t√∫. Adem√°s podemos hablar de lo linda que eres como Directora, demostraste que no se tiene que ser odiosa y abusiva para saber dirigir, gracias por existir."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I remember watching the BTS of her recording the reputation songs hooks and chorus and thinking ‚Äú Wow she is really in her element, and 100% knows what she is doing‚Äù and thats exactly how I felt on watching her telling sadie and dylan how she wanted the final shots to be and what her vision is. She is not a musician who also tried directing, She‚Äôs a musician and a director, periodt."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"""She's fine, but she's not who we met."" How incredibly resonant. <3 I want behind the scenes on any and all Taylor creations. It's also mindblowing!"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"The fact that she keeps looking at her phone means that she had the entire vision written out before they started filming which is just mindblowing to me for someone who isn't a professional director. She gives such clear instructions because she has she has such a clear vision in her head. Dylan and Sadie did a tremendous job bringing it to live. This short film deserved all the awards that it got.

Edit: just found out she's going to make her debut as a director and scriptwriter on the big screen. This is not a drill, people, i repeat, THIS IS NOT A DRILL!"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I remember watching the BTS of her recording the reputation songs hooks and chorus and thinking ‚Äú Wow she is really in her element, and 100% knows what she is doing‚Äù and thats exactly how I felt on watching her telling sadie and dylan how she wanted the final shots to be and what her vision is. She is not a musician who also tried directing, She‚Äôs a musician and a director, periodt."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"the way taylor fully explains how each scene wants to act out and truly get in  scene itself while still being shy and nervous about it is so fun and refreshing to see her light bulbs light up and getting her to be more comfortable is really interesting to see i love it. 

you've done a fantastic-brilliant job tay-tay <3"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"knowing that taylor directed the music video for all too well is one thing, but being able to see her do it makes me so proud. I love her, I was part of the campaign for her to release the 10 minute version of all too well since 2012. It's been magical to see it all. üíó"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,17 year's in her music career and she's still shining bright like a diamond . What a legend Taylor has become!
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"""She's fine, but she's not who we met... We're watching a person come of age."" üò≠ And we did. I'm so proud of you Taylor. Look at what you've made."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Director Taylor Swift is genuinely something so empowering. I love watching her mind work and the end result was of course impeccable
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"A mastermind indeed, Taylor! Incredible director, beautiful actors... it's all too well!"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Taylor must have been the most productive person in the whole pandemic era. I wonder if anyone else noticed she hugs everyone at the end of the scenes, such a sweetheart"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,This bought tears to my eyes. They all did such an amazing job. All too well us truly a timeless piece of art and the story that comes along with it touched all our hearts. Thank you for sharing this with us <3
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Damn seeing Taylor direct is awesome but seeing Sadie be directed and the way she responds to what she's given and how she acts upon it is literal magic, that's impressive"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I don‚Äôt have anything to say but amazing! This is a 10 min. Song short video that is so masterful. Perfect cast Taylor bringing everything to life and directing it so well. She‚Äôs truly a master of entertainment. Respect to her and hope she continues to work and never retires. I‚Äôm here for all her projects!
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Taylor sure wants the All Too Well short film to turns out like how she pictured it in her mind. Her direction was so detailed. So proud of Sadie and Dylan they literally gave Taylor how she wants the roles be playedüò≠üò≠. Im looking forward of Taylor‚Äôs more projects with themüíôüíôüíúüíú
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,S√∫per orgullosa de nuestra reina!! Muy interesante ver todo el proceso creativo.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I'm so inspired by everything you do and say Taylor. There's no other person who could be this creative, talented and passionate. I love you and I'm proud of you, forever & always‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Taylor seems to have an innate ability to visualize a concept, a scene, or an emotion, and translate that vision into words. Her right and left brains work seamlessly together. Whether it's in the concept of a new album, the lyrics to a song, or the directions to others, the end product is professional and seemingly effortless. Of course, it's not and never was. It's taken her years and tears to arrive at this point. It's taken constant dedication to the minutiae to perfect her craft. And now here we all are, eagerly awaiting to see what's next."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"This definitely deserves an award. I felt all the emotions that was displayed in the music video. When I seen this music video for the first time, I cried like a baby. Taylor Swift, thank you for this masterpiece."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I love this so much. Thankyou for taking us behind the scenes, Taylor. Its always such a joy experiencing your art."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I love this! I love seeing the behind the scenes of just Taylor doing her artistic creative things.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"How can you be a genius lyrically, musically and still be an amazing director as well??? What can't this woman do?"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"sadie seems to be so professional, she just sits there and looks closely at everything taylor proposes. she did a great job on all too well."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Wow. This is so amazing and inspiring to watch, especially as someone who dreams of someday maybe being a director :‚Äô ) it feels like such an impossible dream but stuff like this reminds me why I‚Äôm so passionate about it. I‚Äôm so glad these moments were captured, it makes the whole film even more beautiful to me."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Taylor telling Sadie how to smile or what the vibe of emotion is or how to react really just shows that Taylor remembers all those moments with Jake so well.... All Too Well
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,This is amazing! Taylor is insanely talented in everything she does ! Yes love this so much !
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I just love how she work hard for everything ‚ù§
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I love that these are actual clips of the behind the scenes and not just a fast-paced montage of tiny clips with music over it like they do nowadays. Love seeing Taylor as a director, she‚Äôs amazing at everything she does‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"This is the most ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äù content we‚Äôve gotten in years, as someone who‚Äôs been here since the beginning, I‚Äôm so emotional.

10,M0Ku_op-LXI,They are so lucky to be directed by Taylor Swift üòçüòáüòá
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I‚Äôm just really thankful that Taylor started trusting herself and her artistry in terms of directing her own music videos. There is NOTHING she can‚Äôt do.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,watching Taylor in her element doing her thing is pretty amazing. Keep up the great work!  i still remember watching her win her 1st award. Doing amazing! much love.
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Thank you so much taylor!!! I still feel incredibly grateful for seeing you work with dylan!! I‚Äôm so proud of your work and dedication, thank you!! Also i‚Äôm thankful for everyone who worked with you! Thank you for sharing your stories with us. I love you! üíñüíñüíñ"

10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Ugh who just doesn‚Äôt love Taylor she is just a beautiful piece of artwork that we all needed in this music industry
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"The way she's describing how this love felt FOR her and how SHE saw herself is so amazing, this must be so healing for her. To be able to control the narrative that was originally manipulated. 10/10"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"SHE CAME BACK STRONGER THAN A 90'S TREND
because SHE IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRYüëë"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,She isn't a creator of masterpiece. She is a masterpiece üò≠
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"4:18 this part gives me a goosebumps, you can see from Taylor Swift reaction she reminiscing or having a Deja Vu because of Sadie, she saw her reflection to Sadie as a young Taylor Swift literally Taylor Swift reminds her saddest birthday in her life! What a great actress!!! üôÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"This captures the essence of growing up after your first heartbreak. Looking back and being like, ""wow, I've grown so much""."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,The fact that she's so creative and attentive in creating this masterpiece is INSANE! üôåüèº
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"This just makes me so much more proud of her, how she was able to just prompt these actors and they just got it. Like the script feels so loose and yet she captured everything she envisioned perfectly. It‚Äôs really incredible."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,Loved seeing Taylor in her new element.  I‚Äôd love to see more behind-the-scenes footage.  This was satisfying to watch. Now I‚Äôm going to go watch‚Äôs the video‚Ä¶for the millionth time.

10,M0Ku_op-LXI,We want more behind the scenes of Taylor directing her music videos!!
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"TAYLOR IS NOT JUST THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, SHE IS THE WHOLE ART."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I'm so excited to have this! One of the best parts for me when I really love or connect with something is getting the story behind it, the additional footage, bloopers, the changes in perspective from beginning, middle and end of creation. Thank you!  ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,I've being saying for several years that I could see Taylor being a full blown feature movie director some day. This just proves it..
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,this happens when the director was also the composer/singer of the song... she exactly know what she wants to portray in the masterpiece ü•π
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"Usually behind the scenes includes everybody equally, the actors and the directors. This was primarily Taylor Swift. This should have been called ""watch Taylor Swift's directing abilities"""
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,17 year's in her music career and she's still shining bright like a diamond üíé. What a legend Taylor has become!
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,This was so much fun to watch ! Taylor did a awesome job directing
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,i love this! so interesting to watch. i hope we get to see more behind the scenes
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,"I love Taylor Swift, but few major things that I love the most, are that she absolutely loves what she does, her personality its like, she celebrates her work, craft of music, art everything so beautifully. There are few people who are so lucky to wake up in the morning and feel amazing about their work and Taylor Swift is just that..she is such a talented song-writer, composer, what really impresses me is the words, she plays with words beautifully and inculcate in the music more beautifully. Here, she is an amazing director, its evident she has a strong vision, she was excited, thrilled about this music video as we can see, and thats why it turned out the way it turned out. I love her song-writing more than anything. Dylan is amazing but special shout out to Sadie Sink for being so professional and talented..she is an amazing actress, she has miles to go, I wish her best for her future endeavours, looking forward for her upcoming works other than ST."
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,You are absolutely AMAZING. The amount of talent in this short film...
10,M0Ku_op-LXI,She had to relive this tragic story over and over. No one else COULD direct it.  She is the bravest woman. The way she bares it all for the world to see and dissect.

10,fuvBUOqwlDk,"Mr. Jiggys worth I don't know where to start in expressing how grateful I am for your new song or how I feel right now. The entire reason I watch you, Sir EK, is because of the unexplainable sentiments you make me experience when my ear lobes come into contact with the sound waves of your music. The nuclear fusion required to create the most powerful brilliant celestial explosion, known as a supernova, is absolutely enormous, yet to you, mister Jiggington, it is just one of many explosions you create every time you release a song.
Mr EK this song has changed my life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in the world, in fact this entire universe, has changed. This stream represents emotion, reality, aunthenicity, in fact, before I was listening to your songs, I was doing horrible in school with a 1.6 GPA on academic probation. However, ever since I started listening to your songs, my grades have been elevating and flying towards the moon!!! All I can say is thank you, nothing else, for boosting my GPA from a 1.6 to a 3.4!!!! And also thanks for boosting my confidence as well Mr.EK !!!
Sir Jigglesworth you really hit with this one Its completley changed my outlook of life at

10,fuvBUOqwlDk,"Cool song! As a showman, try to have the same energy that‚Äôs on the track and in the video. It‚Äôs blatant when you don‚Äôt and it downplays the song itself unless people are only listening to it. That‚Äôs a major issue amongst many drill rappers when shooting videos. You set yourself separate from others when fans notice and support you solely off of energy.. other people usually pay attention and suddenly want in. Keep up the great hustle, Sha EK!"

10,d4Awzd5CeVc,"Boogie is the kind of success story that encourages me as an underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he‚Äôs developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he‚Äôs been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I‚Äôm happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to Boogieüî•"

10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Allison Young is fantastic in everything she does, but there is some special magic when she collaborates with Josh Turner. I just love it."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"So I‚Äôm listening to this thinking ‚Äúwow, what an amazing song! How come I haven‚Äôt heard that before?‚Äù and then it turns out that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs an original of Allison! Was gonna say that I love your version of the song, but now it needs to be said that not only the arrangement, performance, solos and screenplay are top notch, but the song itself is just super cool and classy!:) Thank you for sharing this!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I didn't think it was possible for Allison's voice to get any better, but I'm hearing some delightful strength and control that wasn't there in years past.  She literally sounds like one of the greats of the silver screen era, a vocalist whom studios back in the day would fight over.  And loved the outtro.  I thought this would be the scene with the tree where Josh dropped the hubcap full of lug nuts and yelled 'Fudge!'   :)"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Allison has truly found her voice. Everything about this song is simply magical!  This needs to become a Christmas classic.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Blown away by the voice. This is from a different era. Today female singers sound like wounded animals, but Allison sounds dreamy, warm and strong. I hear Ella, Patsy, Rita Hayworth, the goddesses I missed because I wasn‚Äôt born yet. ‚ù§"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Holy shit. Y‚Äôall are making some of the most vital American music of our generation. Endless respect.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"When this came to my inbox, I couldn't wait to play it - surely it's a 40s song that I somehow never heard before - then I saw that Alison actually wrote it - well done, you've written a new Christmas classic - and I echo the other comments that Alison, your voice is maturing and developing in a way that amazes me - and Josh, your jazz guitar skills are now up with the greats like Barney Kessel.  Kudos also for your choice of bass and drummer - oh and one final comment, nice solos all round.  You four have really cheered up this 70yo ex guitar player today.   Cheers from the UK."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,This is just wonderful!  The arrangement is fantastic and Allison does an absolutely beautiful job on the vocal.  I'm so glad she didn't over sing this.  Her tone and control were perfect.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"How is it possible for Allison's voice to get ever better? She's got a rich, resonant contralto in this song I've never heard in her before. And Josh is a master of any musical genre (as is Allison) with his creative, melodic soloing. Of course, he's a great singer as well.
But among their talents, one is often overlooked during the glowing comments on their videos. Both of them are fabulous songwriters. This song and the songs on their EP is ample proof of that."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Allison, Josh, and their community of artists produce the consistently best and most uplifting content anywhere. Thank you so much for this beautiful piece!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Absolutely amazing! The crews that Josh assembles are great. This is how music is supposed to be‚Ä¶.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Shout to Josh fabulous as always.  Special shout out to the bass player, I could actually hear you and it was really nice.  Now that drummer, he is so creative with the unconventional use of the cymbals!  It was all so delightful!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,That Oktava ML-219 microphone and Allison's voice is pure magic! Excellent well-written song.... I love it!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Love this! - what a duo
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,If you put Allison on stage singing in a black & white film starring Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers I would never know that she was from 2022. Timeless.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I could listen to her sing all day long!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Now you just need to take a time machine back to 1951, leave this track sat by the gramophone, and you‚Äôll come back to 2022 to find it‚Äôs a Christmas classic! Great work all üéÑ"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,And incredible song. May 9-12 was such a special album and this Christmas song is something I had been hoping would happen. Also love the vlog bits at the end. The cinematography is always so lively and fun
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Hi musicians, from The Netherlands we wish you nice days in this ""dark"" month december and in the end Happy Christmas days!!
BY the way, BEAUTIFUL SONG! THANKS voor some Jazzy!! üå®Ô∏èüå®Ô∏èüå§Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. It is cold, damp and dark here in the UK but that song made things better for a few minutes."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,The boy can play guitar. What a great vocal number. Allison‚Äôs voice is perfect for the style. Well played
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"This is more spectacular than ‚ÄúFever,‚Äù and I thought it couldn‚Äôt get any better than that!!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Wow.  Just Wow - what a voice.  And any production involving Josh is never going to disappoint.  As soon as Allison starts singing - all smiles from me.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,What a hearth warming voice.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Oh wow, that's beautiful. Well written and performed but huge props to Kelly for her timing with the video, landing on people at exactly the right time, each time."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Allison, this jazzy kind of music is such a great match for your voice! Your timing is faultless, and of course the clarity and timbre of your voice are beautiful as always."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I assumed this must be an old Christmas song, written by some legend nearly a century ago, but no!  Written by Allison!  This is seriously good, and up there with the classics.  Allison, get Michael Bubl√© to sing it, and you'll never have to work again!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I was just looking forward to this year's Josh Turner Christmas song. Thank you for another piece of beauty made music. Already excited for next year's one!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Incredible show of musicianship in this challenging piece. Love it !
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I find Allison's voice to be absolutely mesmerizing. I've watched/listened many times over to the songs that she sings with Josh. The song ""Crazy"" by Patsy Cline was never a song that I really cared for but I've listened to Allison and Josh's rendition countless times. All of you are fantastic talents and hard workers."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Outstanding, such outstanding talent. Class total class, you kids give hope to the new generation. I can say that cuz I‚Äôm a 77 yr old geezer who‚Äôs covered a few miles. Happy Holidays ......... Kids üòÉ"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"For a group of young people, you all sound incredibly authentic for this style of music. If I had heard this in the 60s it would've sounded completely natural."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,The full quartet is bringing the full force of Christmas together & I'm absolutely here for it. I would be remiss however if I didn't say how Truely Magical Allison sounds. Honestly I can't get enough of that soft & silky delivery of hers.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I don¬¥t need Christmas songs, but this one is extra cool. Such an amazing voice ‚ú®‚ù§"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Beautiful. You are such talented musicians!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I always look forward to Josh's Christmas release and anytime Allison is involved you know it's going to be awesome and today we get both rolled up into one!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,This really sounds like something from the 1940s.  Great composition Allison! Wow!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"What a voice! Can't believe it is not Ella Fitzgerald.  I'd like to hear Allison do ""Dream a little dream."""
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Fabulous! Cheered me up on a dismal Monday afternoon!!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I think it's a classic, already, and a wonderful ""Josh and Friends"" addition to my Christmas playlist!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I had no idea Allison plays the piano, and well, I might add. Josh comping some jazzy progressions. You guys keep surprising me time and time again! Only missed some harmonies here, you sound sooo good together! Keep making music!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I first stumbled upon Alison about 3 or 4 years ago when I was looking at Post Modern Jukebox videos. When I found her channel, I was so happy! She amazes me with her voice, all of the multiple instruments that she plays, her whistling, sing all of the background harmonies, and how she films her videos...

Then, I was introduced to Josh, by following Alison. Josh is among the most skilled guitarists I have ever seen or heard. I loved his creativity and he is an extremely versatile vocalist as well. 

It always seems like magic when you two work together! I absolutely love this video, song, and performance!

However, because I hadn't seen any new posts in well over a month from Alison, I was getting concerned. This was a huge joy for me to see and listen to, as a result. 

God bless you all! I loved the work of the drummer and bass player and the video director, sound guy, camera man, everyone involved!

Merry Christmas to you all! O know that this is an original song, but it sounds like a classic song from the 1940's or 1950's!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Allison is the counter-argument to every pessimist out there.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I‚Äôm a musician so I could talk about the vocalist tone and control or the cleanliness of your guitar as always but it‚Äôs such a comforting song that I‚Äôm just gonna cuddle up here at home and listen üòä
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Loved the song. Josh and Allison are magic together. Had me grinning when the camera guy (Josh‚Äôs wife?) lost it during the drum solo. The drummer is a character for sure. Instant Christmas classic.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Your music makes me nostalgic for a life I've never lived.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Allison has some keys skills I didn‚Äôt know about!!! An instant classic. Thank you!!!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Amazing, you all make it look so effortless..and fun.  And Alison's voice is silky smooth, perfect for the song and the season"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,And a HUGE nod to the camera and production crew. STELLAR! Maybe wife Kelly is doing it. She needs to insert herself in the videos every now and then. I like it when she has lyric sheets taped to her while filming.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Sounds tremendous, Josh and Al!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,The quality of her voice is amazing
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,you guys just make me smile...that's priceless!!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,So fantastic! So so good! She's our Joe Stafford-- and josh is JOSH! Merry Christmas to all involved in this wonderful number!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Outstanding!
I've never heard this song before.
After a brief search online I couldn't find it by anyone else. Is this an original song?
It has such a great WWII, Big Band era feel to it!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I sense a Christmas classic in the making!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I had no idea it was an original when I listened to it...nice writing by Allison!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,What a lovely new Christmas standard. Great job to everyone involved!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,PLEASE  Make a whole seasonal album with this group!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Allison Young is the classic 1940's singer. So talented! Josh on guitar, amazing! Love the piano, guitar, bass and drum highlights. This was an excellent recording. Josh on drums, and Russell on Bass! Very well done."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Allison your voice is heavenly ... pure
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,You got Russell Hall! I've loved watching him with Emmett Cohen over the past 2 years. What an incredible combo here.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Allison  voice,always sounds  so good!üéÑüéÑüéÑüôÇüíØ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"You two are so good together! Josh, it was you who introduced me to the amazing Miss Allison; and I want to thank you for that!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Saw Allison sing with Post Modern Jukebox on their Australia tour. this year. She has got such a fantastic voice
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,We'd like to perform this song at our Christmas concerts next year. Please send contact info. Thank you!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,You're all just sooo good. Sounds great!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,I was just wondering when Josh & crew would release a Christmas track. Look forward to it every year.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"that series of solos in the mid is gooooooood. but hellllllllll, there's some chemistry between our main man josh and allison."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,What this piece needs is some serious airtime. It has all the elements to become a ‚ÄúChristmas Classic!‚Äù
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Wonderful!!!

My spouse heard this coming from my computer before seeing the video and said 'She sounds like Patsy Cline!' ... one of my favorite female voices!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,What a wonderful arrangement ü•∞
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,This is a great song wonderfully performed. Congratulations to everyone involved. The metronome cat on the ‚Äútop of the tree‚Äù is the icing on the cake.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Just a delightful song, beautifully sung with great background accompaniment.  Such character and presence.  Loved it!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"The moment the piano set's in.. oh my gosh it's perfect
surely with the voice

this is an overall winner"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Oh man!  That was fantastic!  Thank you for sharing your talents!,"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Epic voice wow!üôèüôèüôè instrumental as well!üôèüôèüôè
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Can't even recall seeing Allison on the keys before; was about to say I was impressed at her many talents when I hit the description box and saw she also composed the tune!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Wonderful! Beautiful performance!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,What a voice!
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Wow! What a beautiful sound.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"Finally a new and original Christmas Classic!
We only had to wait 70 years to get there..."
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Wow! The jazz greats are smiling in their graves.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,That voice is like breathing fresh air on a winter morning.  Their is no One on the internet who can do that...just amazing.
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,"I can't believe how good this is. Great writing, performing, and a drummer who plays . . . THE AIR? Come on!"
10,xnjYHFG4vCM,Very mature sounding voice to be this young Allison... I loved it...

It always encourages me to work harder on my own craft and the quality of my music as I learn more. If I keep that mindset, I may be able to blow up someday too!"

10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Vik killed it in both songs.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,I can‚Äôt get enough of jme‚Äôs verse. He‚Äôs just made for rap. He‚Äôs one of the best artists.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"JJ's verse is actually üî•, tone sounds mad with the energy"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Tobi's verse was my favourite, his singing is perfect, his flow is amazing, it's just TOO GOOD!"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Tobi's line is just too chill gives me tingle down in my spine
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Vik has improved intensely since the last Christmas song, you all killed it"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Vik and Tobi on a drill tune is the highlight. JME is just natural talent and KSI on the hook was fire!!
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Tobi‚Äôs part really got it. Get chills everytime I listen to it. BODIED THAT. Needs his own r&b song ish
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Tobis verse was honestly amazing, Viks monotone voice with his calmness is amazing, JMEs flow was insane, and jjs chorus was crazy"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Bro, Tobi stays making great songs. He deserves all the recognition for this. Vik was hitting some crazy bars, too, on the same type beat Ethan did in the last Christmas song with his voice all deep? Lit. As for KSI and JME? Common W from them, as is with Kon."
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"This was such a shocking BANGER!! , tobi and vik sounded significantly better then the last song!"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This song honestly made my winter. I feel like now a days youtubers don't really try to create like holiday based songs anymore. It is kinda like how the yogscast used to make christmas parodies and stuff like that.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Everytime Tobi sings its always so lit, like he is just made for songs"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"No one has said it so I'll say it, JJ's chorus was unreal."
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Omg this is my favourite Christmas song so far it brings me shivers down my spine lol. If only they did it all together that will be great I'm looking forward for more content in the future
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Vikk was a surprise, Tobi/JJ/JME as always killing it üî•‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"JME, KSI, Vik and Tobi album please, thanks. This song is fire, everybody killed it!"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,I‚Äôm Deadass gonna be singing this like a regular Christmas song üòÇ.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"JME's bars, Tobi's singing, Vik's coolness and JJ's vocals couldn't have made a better song. There was nothing the other team could do to win this one"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"This is actually mad good, talking about how bad of a situation we are all in right now and how many people are struggling. We'll done lads"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"They all Killed it, Jme opened wit the verse, Tobis vocal and flow, JJs chorus is amazing, Vik wit the 123 makes this a banger"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This will be an iconic Christmas song
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This needs to make number 1! love it! üíïüíï
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"it¬¥s fire man JJ ,Tobi, Vikk and JME¬¥s flow and vocals it¬¥s üî•üî•üî•üî•"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Bro JJ And The WHOLE TEAM KILLED IT!! ITS NOW MY NUMBER 1 CHRISTMAS SONG!!!!!!
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Can't have been easy for Vik to go into the studio with a room full of published musicians and try to put out a serious rap verse but he killed it honestly
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Just imagine the potential for this song if they worked on this for longer.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,cant believe im listening to this track the whole day. damn catchy!
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,i‚Äôm obsessed with this song hence why i keep coming backüò≠
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,I love this so much it‚Äôs the best Christmas song I‚Äôve heard on so far though every Christmas we have had ‚ù§
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,JME is genuinely so talented it's unbelievable.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,The fact that they made a proper Christmas song in 12 hours is extremely impressive.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"That was so good, that this song got me smiling broüî•"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This is actually so sick üî• Already listened to it like 5 times üòÖ  SO deserves Christmas no.1
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Man this needs to be on the charts !!
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"Vik killed it bro , the swag the aura the lyrics , all top notch"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,I can‚Äôt get enough !!! It‚Äôs sooo good
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,I‚Äôm so happy these guys took it seriously and made a banger! Even knowing this or that is jokes I really wanted a good sidemen song
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,It's funny that this is literally what me and the homies do for Jam sessions but we don't have the means to bring the music out this is a banger for sure I just wish every Banger could be heard. JJ if you read this I've been vibing with you the long way let me talk with you Music Man to the Million Dollar Man

10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This team made a legendary music video and song while the other team made a legendary meme. Both team killed it
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Banger song I'll play this everyday to make myself laugh and jam out
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"I know there‚Äôs issues getting this one on the radio even though it might chart, next year they should do clean VS explicit Christmas song. JJ, Harry, Bez defo on the explicit team. Tobi on the clean team of course as the good Christian boy he is (minus the amount of girls he‚Äôs linked up to)"
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,1:43 - 2:03 Vik killed it in 20 seconds
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Tobi's lines and how he sung them.. Just make my spine literally get a Tingle üò≥üòÇ

10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Tobi's flow and verseüî• chills everytime . Don't get me wrong everyone killed it but Tobiüëëüî•
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,"the way JME is slept on as a grime MC is criminal, man's a real poet."
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Vikk's lyrics and his attitude matched superbly!! and JJ's chorus was SICK!
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Jme opening this song is like a movie premiering on a weekend and It makes a billy. Dope as Fuck.
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,JME gets the song wrapped up with a chill vik with the violent lyrics and Tobis smooth delivery and JJ with the vocal masterclass big ups to conüî•üî•
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,Vik has just proved to us once more he is truly one of our generations greatest lyricists üî•
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This is about to be the best Christmas song of the year
10,sXDBXVjKbp8,This team made a legendary music video and song while the other team made a legendary meme. Both team killed it

10,6XrTe5Agki4,"EPHESIANS 5: 1-5.
Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.
For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."

10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Oh man I love this song!  Cool 90s!!   The lead singer is Nigerian-Brian actress/singer Saffron, and I always loved her vibe.  Sadly, Republica didn't have many hits... this was their biggest, but please check out ""Drop Dead Gorgoeus"" if you do another one.  For more along this line, I recommend ""Connection"" by Elastica, ""Stupid Girl"" by Garbage, ""Fait Accompli"" by Curve, ""Feed the Tree"" by Belly, and ""Sweetness and Light"" by Lush.  (All female groups).  Put it in perspective, of the nearly 1800 songs you guys have reacted to, just over 200 have been from the 90s.  You have hundreds more bangers to go!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Some essential 90s Female Friday picks that you'd probably love, Jay   - Elastica ""Connection"", Veruca Salt ""Seether"" are both some great rock/pop choices.  And you're totally sleeping on two INCREDIBLE Kims that I think Amber might dig - Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth doing ""Kool Thing"" and Kim Deal from the Breeders (and the Pixies) doing ""Cannonball.""  Come on y'all!  Give the people what they want!  ;-)"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Whoa, this was a surprise. This was part of that cool Electronica sound in the 90s where people meshed different genres with electronic dance music. Something I think you'd both like for different reasons is the group Portishead. They feature a very distinct female vocalist and fall under the 90's Electronica umbrella but more towards Trip-Hop. What's trip-hop? It's a cool blend of hip hop beats with electronic pop, sometimes elements of jazz and is real atmospheric and moody stuff, but so cool. I'd recommend Portishead's ""Roads"", ""Glory Box"", ""Strangers"", Only You or Numb."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This was an English alternate/rock band
who released ""Ready to Go"" as a single in 1996. It wasn't  included in their debut album Republica. It reached #43 on the UK charts. It was remixed and re-released in 1997 and made it to #13.
The video with a punk fuelled dance
made for great entertainment. Great reaction. Buckets of Maple Syrup love from Canada ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  üá®üá¶ üá®üá¶"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Awesome 90‚Äôs jam. You have to listen to Hook by Blues Traveler next. Its another great 90‚Äôs jam. The most meta song ever. Best harmonica solo in history. FYI, if you do listen to it do the version with lyrics, not the music video. And read the lyrics. They are genius."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"A couple other 90s female rocks songs in this (approximate) vein-
Elastica- ""Stutter"" or ""Connection""
L7- ""Pretend We're Dead""
Luscious Jackson- ""Deep Shag""
Garbage- ""Only Happy When It Rains""
PJ Harvey- ""Dress"" or ""Sheela Na Gig""
Pretty much anything from the first Lush album. :)"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I liked them. They were a '90s band. Techno punk rock, new wave. Alternative music.  This song was big and played a lot at sporting events and night clubs.  Their other hit video was ""Drop Dead Gorgeous Girl"". Bands like them were Elastica, Garbage The Breeders, and others."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,This whole record is a pop/rock masterpiece. EVERY song on the record is a banger. I've been listening to this record every since it was released. I remember even Elton John giving it a rave review. I would recommend to anybody reading this to check out the rest of the record. Ear candy.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"If you enjoyed this, and why wouldn't you as it's fire, you should check out ""As heaven is wide"" by the band Garbage another great track but with a different feel to it"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Great reaction!  I still love this song all this time later.  As someone mentioned below you should also check out Republica's ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"".  Another great female-led band from the 90s is Garbage, you should check out their song ""Stupid Girl"" - great song and great video!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This was such a big song for me back in the 90s! They used to use this song for car commercials, it was everywhere. üòÜ 
This song reminds me somewhat of ‚ÄúShut Up and Let Me Go‚Äù by the Ting Tings. Definitely one to check out although it‚Äôs not 90s it‚Äôs  2008.
Still putting a plug in for Texas and Ivy for 90s female fronted bands. Also The Corrs! I don‚Äôt know if anyone has mentioned them. ‚ù§"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I remember a few months before Republica's debut single, their record label sent out what was known as a cassette single to all the people on their mailing list. This cassingle  had about 90 second samples of four different Republica songs and you had to tick a box on the included postcard which track was your favourite and mail it back to the label. Months later and Ready To Go was the winner. It came out as a single followed by a remix which fared even better in the charts. 90s market research pre - internet!!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Another great 90s song you guys would enjoy for female Friday's is Six Underground by The Sneaker Pimps
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,If you like this sound then you should definitely get more into the band Garbage. Shirley Manson is awesome.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I love this song! Other bands from roughly the same time period with a similar vibe are: Garbage (""Stupid Girl"", ""When I Grow Up"") & Elastica (""Connection"")."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"If you would like something with similar energy for your next female Friday you might try Garbage, which was fronted by Shirley Manson.  I‚Äôm Only Happy When It Rains or Stupid Girl would be a good place to start."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Can't see the 90s were hit or miss. This song was great. It's just a lot of fun and it doesn't go much deeper than that. It was used in a car commercial and I don't remember what to make but that's pretty good application for this song. Thanks for everything you guys do. It's fun to watch you discover stuff.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I do love this song. I used to think I was a Metalhead but watching these reactions with you makes me realize I'm just a music lover with a bias to heavy metal.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I was fortunate enough to get to spend a LOT of time with Republica, precisely when they were hitting!

The band I was with [Love In Reverse] and Republica spent a while opening for Gravity Kills on their tour, in '96.
When Republica got a headlining slot [due to the success of: ""Ready To Go""], they chose US to open for them on their U.S. tour.
(Total, killer bills! Both ways!)

‚ÄîThis album is not respected in the way it should be (nor is this band).

Saffi is an amazing vocalist and had the PERFECT demeanor and tone for the times.

""Ready To Go"" is a spectacular cut (throw this on at any party and whatever passes for a dance-floor is bumpin' (so long as there are at least 2 people in the house! üòúüòõüòÜ), practically, automatically!!
All time √ºber-banger!ü§òü§ò

...but the rest of the album is nearly as good!

""Bloke"";
""Drop Dead Gorgeous"";
""Picture Me"";
""Get Off"";
""Out Of The Darkness""
...et al.!

‚ÄîGo listen!

‚ÄîPlenty of people have accusatory, unfavorable stuff to say regarding the simplicity of (and, also: notable similarity of plenty of) the songs on this album ...however: if that is what they think, they, obviously, weren't alive, or listening to music, at the time (or, simply: aren't paying attention!), because:the entire music industry was ""dumbing-it-down"" and (simultaneously) trying to ""amalgamate"": ""Punk rock"" and ""catchy pop"" and synths and loud, crunchy guitars [which were the identifiable things that seemed to be present in most of the music that attracted larger audiences (in the late '80s and, then, early, '90s), although the label heads couldn't, actually, figure out ""why.""]
Most bands (and often: constructed ones) did so BADLY!

Republica, just, hits on all cylinders and, their writing and arrangements are what make them stand out (among a laundry-list of also-rans, not worthy of any attention, at all).
The album is undeniable. (even the follow-up was quite good!) and as a song-writer, there are little (important) nuances you will notice, if you are listening.
The ""everyday fan"" (who pays attn. to NONE of that [nor understands HOW to!]), will  (more-than-likely) NOT notice, but: they will, still, find it impossible to: keep their booty and/or legs from movin'!

This is, definitely, a ""synth-driven"" band ...a common feature in ""alterna-"" whatever styles of the '90s (post '94, particularly). ...but: what it had done was: it took the stereotyped ''80s synth-pop"" sound and attitude, and ""darkened it.""  ...A lot more ""heft.""...heaviness, density and, also: cynicism, darkness, mocking,...in the lyrics (even if they were funny).
Republica, definitely, features buzzy-guitars (with a clean (processed) edge) and throbbing, club-beat (synth-)bass and beats, but they have catchy, quirky, memorable melodies and an overall celebratory attitude.
If you can't have fun to THIS, you can't have fun AT ALL.

REPUBLICA were a cool-ass band (and just, personally: some of the loveliest, kindest, most fun and convivial people I've ever met.
They made being in their presence a joy.  They made the slog of touring an excellent experience (you don't ALWAYS get that!)‚Äîand EVERY night, WITHOUT fail: they brought the audience a SUPERB, undeniable show & an easy, great time.).

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Saffron was cool as hell.  Try Shirley Manson from Garbage too, I'm Only Happy When It Rains."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"For me, this song will always be connected to ""The Real World: Boston"" from 1997.  I taped the Real World: Boston episodes on VHS tape (still have the tapes).  This song was used a lot during that season when the housemates went out drinking, dancing, & partying in Boston bars.  It's one of my favorite seasons of the The Real World."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,This is one of those songs that is in a million movies from the 90's. Peak 90's vibes.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Let's get some Shirley Manson on this channel PLEASE üî•
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,More 90s electronica/dance-rock like Chemical Brothers ‚ÄúSetting Sun‚Äù and ‚ÄùBlock Rockin Beats‚Äù and The Prodigy ‚ÄúFirestarter‚Äù and ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äù please.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Wow I never thought I‚Äôd see this one on a reaction video. It‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve heard it but it‚Äôs a fun one! Something similar would be Garbage ‚ÄúOnly Happy When it Rains‚Äù (but also recommend ‚ÄúPush It‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm Paranoid‚Äù). The lead singer is Shirley Manson and is another great Female Friday pick. Also a 90s rock band with two lead females called Veruca Salt, check out ‚ÄúVolcano Girls‚Äù and Seether‚Äù
Edit: reading the comments I see many of us have similar recommendations for Garbage and Veruca Salt üòÜ"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,love this song! Also love the joy you give from this fun channel! please check out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only happy when it rains‚Äùby Garbage. A great 90‚Äôs rock/grunge tune! Thanks for the great energy. Rock on!‚úåÔ∏è
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Love this song.  If you listen to the lyrics it's about giving a boyfriend or girlfriend a second chance in their relationship.  Such a catchy tune.  Love the techno-rock sound from the 90's.  It's a shame this band was really a one-hit wonder besides Drop Dead Gorgeous which was almost similar to Ready To Go.  Really like Saffron.  Such a cutie.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I had this cd single. Riding around at the beach in my first car. Ah memories. Drop Dead Gorgeous is another good single from them.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Can't go wrong with Republica... Elastica...  Really, any early 90s female band with an ""ica"" in the name is great."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Bring on the 90s.  I think you'll find it was a great decade.  Female Friday is incomplete without adding something from the Riot Grrrl movement.  ""Rebel Girl"" by Bikini Kill is a classic and a good place to start."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Some overlooked 90‚Äôs bands that you must check out!
Candlebox- ‚ÄúFar Behind‚Äù
P.O.D. - ‚ÄúYouth of The Nation‚Äù
Spin Doctors - ‚ÄúLittle Miss Can‚Äôt Be Wrong‚Äù
Dave Matthews Band - ‚ÄúAnts Marching‚Äù
Blues Traveler - ‚ÄúHook‚Äù
Third Eye Blind - ‚ÄúSemi-Charmed Life‚Äù

Those are some bands that helped define the 90‚Äôs that are outside the Grunge stuff (which I love) that deserve a listen."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Yes!!!! Finally!!!! This was every club kid, getting ready to hit the scene song, and I'm ready to buy a far and drive with the windows down song! Please listen to The Breeders, and ANYTHING by Oasis!!!! It's time to venture into Brit pop!!!!!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Jay and Amber, appreciate the selections you choose from all genres of music you react to. For Female Friday, if you get a chance, check out another artist from England, singer/songwriter Dido with her huge international release of ""White Flag"" from back in 2003. Her signature song ""Thank You"" from 1999 I believe you already reacted to.üîç"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Nobody ruled Electronica like Garbage did.

Let them hear ‚ÄúI Think I‚Äôm Paranoid.‚Äù"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Love this. You guys nailed it when you said the 90's had the most eclectic mix of music. Really is what keeps me coming back to it personally. In that same vein I'd argue the 90's probably had a higher percentage of one-hit-wonders then just about any other decade as well. It just felt like there was a new artist with a totally new sound showing up every week. Love it or hate it, the 90s was exploding with creativity."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"eclectic is the perfect word to describe the 90s... music, fashion, books, tv, etc.  It was vast and diverse."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"The britishness is strong with this one. The 90s saw a lot of British acts blend rock with the various genres of dance music that had emerged in the 80s and early 90s. This lovely little one hit wonder was one of them.

To me the 90s is defined by how recording technology reached a level that the music is no longer marked by its time in terms of sound. For example: Nirvana‚Äôs monster album Nevermind wouldn‚Äôt have sounded much different had it been recorded today. And that‚Äôs true of most music from the 90s. As opposed to the preceding decades, where the sound is immediately recognisable as coming from that decade."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"If you're delving into the 90s for bands with female lead singers a good one to react to is ""Stupid Girl"" by Garbage."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Definitely on the rollerblading at break neck speed iTunes list.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,There was a HUGE difference between 90s music in the US and the Europe...with the latter being much better ;)
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"üåüThe 90s music was eclectic!  Please check out Pentatonix ""90s Dance Medley""! They nail the iconic dance music of the era! Great way to get a Pentatonix reaction and 90s dance music at the same time! It's amazing how they replicate the techno/Eurodance sound acapella. The only exception is when they pay homage to Cher's song with autotune but you have to...Awesome workout Playlist, too! üíñ"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I love this song! Republica has another great song you'd like called 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Check out Sneaker Pimps ""Six Underground"". Lead singer was Kelli Ali. Definitely a great 90's female singer."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I always felt the 90s music was trying to find an identity after the 70s and 80s.  A lot of the focus was introspective and anxsty and that even leaked into the fast stuff.  I feel much of the 90s was a bit of a deterioration in music because it felt scattered and lost and didn't know which direction it was heading.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This was fun! Check out ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" sometime. Female Friday Request: Sharon O'Neill--Maxine. She is from Australia and a great songwriter. Thanks!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,This brings me back. Please check out the band Garbage. Only happy when it Rains and Stupid Girl are both great 90s hits!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"OMG, I forgot about this song and how great it was!  I'm so glad to you reacted to it!
Going back to the 80s, could you please react to Howard Jones - Things Can Only Get Better ?'
It's a pure 80s banger and will remind Jay why he likes the 80s!
Also, I highly recommend Bizzare Love Triangle by New Order.  It was a great synthpop hit!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"You guys need to do Drop Dead Gorgeous from Republica; that was my favorite song from there! I bought this album from both these songs; when it was first out. Fun group, fun music"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This song rips.  More ass-kickin ladies:
Republica - Drop Dead Gorgeous
Guano Apes - Open Your Eyes
Veruca Salt - Seether
Garbage - I Think I'm Paranoid
Dionne Farris - I Know What You're Doing
Pat Benatar - Heartbreaker
Quarterflash - Harden My Heart
Sheryl Crow - Lifetimes
Patty Smythe - No Mistakes"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Hope someday you have a listen to Canadian female rocker Avril Lavigne - Complicated.....I know you guys will dig it....üëçüëçüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüòéüá®üá¶
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I'm in the AARP crowd but I remember this song on the radio many years ago. Thanks for letting me know who did it and resurrecting some memories.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Don't recall this group or song, but It's Great! Great to hear not just lead singer, but lots of other hard-rocking Female voices joining in!  Would be happy to hear more! :) CORRECTION: You fooled me Amber! Wasn't watching closely, but could have sworn there were other Female background voices joining in!! Guess it's Her joining herself! :)"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Yeah they were a bit of a flash in the pan - limited output but little or no huge hits. They seemed to do a little better in clubs and Festival work. Not my genre but they had they guts to stand up on stage and have their artistic expression critiqued, so that at least takes some guts and integrity in your product and for that reason they deserve the plaudits they received."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Their whole album is awesome! Love it!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"WOW!!! I couldn't hit LIKE fast enough!! I fell in love with this song, and the singer, about a year ago (very late in the game,) and couldn't stop listening to it (and watching her.) Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Love the 90s! If you want another good 90s banger, check out Lucious Jackson‚Äôs Naked Eye"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Anything from Veruca Salt's Eight Arms To Hold You. That whole album rocks.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"See, Amber gets us 90s kids, we were/are weird, and unashamedly so. We embraced and celebrated the weird, we had to. The 80s were too formulaic. Got big hair, loads of make up and even more hairspray? Great, your an 80s band. Same for the girls too lol. We wanted DIFFERENT, in everything. So, Amber, please accept a few more amazing female fronted 90s suggestions,  a band called Sleeper with the song Inbetweener. Or Echobelly with Great Things. Or the all female Lush."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I loveeee when you do 90s alternative. Instantly brought back to driving aimless around town with my friends! üòÇ Nothing to do in that town but that or go to the mall. Edit: I feel like Jay might like ‚ÄúFirestarter‚Äù by The Prodigy. Definitely heavier than this song but had that 90s electronica sound that became popular toward the end of the decade. My friend tells me it was a rave staple, but I just listened to it for running because I wasn‚Äôt cool enough to attend a rave, haha"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I was very pleasantly surprised to see that you reviewed this song.  Love this song!  This whole album, self-titled and their debut, is slammin'. üòÉ You should also check out Get Off, Bitch, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Bloke, Holly, Out of the Darkness, and Don't You Ever."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,while my best friend and I got ready 'to go' out for the night... this was our anthem! as the last of the liner and lipstick was applied... this song blaring and the door wasn't locked until it finished... 'ready to go!' amazing times!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,For me the 90s was great because it brought us grunge and alternative rock in a big way
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This song rocks!  90s were also a very creative decade for music like the 80s, but the those decades have very distinctive styles from one another‚Ä¶.other than the early 90s crossover years."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I can‚Äôt believe Jay hasn‚Äôt heard this! A lot of sports teams use or used this as walk up music. Right in there with Thunderstruck!  The Caps use it in DC. I‚Äôve heard it at NBA games and broadcasts. The Thunder have probably used it. The Spurs did at one point!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"You seem to think that there was a gap in music between the 1980s & 2000s. Over here in England we had amongst others Blur (Song 2), Oasis (Don't Look Back in Anger) & the 'Modfather' Mr Paul Weller. My favourite performance of his was 'Sunflower' on the tv show Later...... With Jules Holland, a masterpiece. 
Please check it out."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I love this song!  I remember quite well when it came out. This was called ""Alternative Rock"" back at this time"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Saffron has an interesting look. She is British-Nigerian. Her father was English, I think. Her mother was half Portuguese and half Chinese."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"You should react to Garbage 'I'm only happy when it rains', a rock band from the 90s. Shirley Manson the vocalist is amazing"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I had almost forgotten about this song, but it came back instantly once I started listening to it.  I really liked this song in the 90s.  That decade of music (especially the middle-later part of it) was hit or miss for me, but there is no doubt the 90s had plenty of great songs.  Just not nearly as many as the 80s, ha."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Just saw you haven't reacted to Garbage yet.  Shirley Manson is fantastic.  I recommend Stupid Girl or Only Happy When It Rains.  Some more great 90s music for you.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,VOW by GARBAGE is a 90's MUST HEAR!!!!!!!!!!!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"I had a transformative moment to a Republica song. In 1996 MTV held its first Fashionably Loud runway show and Republica was one of the acts performing. I checked it out because I was a young dude who wanted to look at some models and the internet hadn't gotten up to speed yet. But when I saw the clip below I finally awakened to the idea that there was more to music than metal and grunge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNmpGFh2OHM"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Again endorsing the band Garbage for some critical female-fronted 90s music. Try ""Stupid Girl"" off their first album or ""Push It"" from their second to get started. They were a hit machine for a while there, had diminishing returns on albums 3 and 4, but eventually got back together to make three more solid releases."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Ohhh I got old. This came out when I was a freshman in college and I was a raver.  I miss the 90's.   I love that you guys picked Republica!
Check out ""Naked eye"" by Luscious Jackson,  ""Seether"" by Veruca Salt, and ""6 underground"" by the Sneaker Pimps. üòè"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This is a great song, but if you notice, it's Republica's only real hit. I think that is because this song is about as close to rock n roll as they get. I tried listening to some of their other music and it's all that edgy alternative sort of techo-punk that was popular in some scenes back in the day. I can't really get into it."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Before  Fergie, she was Stacy Ferguson in the group Wild Orchid and the song was Talk To Me. Stacy's vocals  powerful  and strong. Check it out"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"So enjoy the mix of music you bring. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have a suggestion for your consideration. Artist is Staxx, song title Joy. üòä"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,This was my jam in 1997! Bloke and drop dead gorgeous are JAMS too!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Oh lawd, this song was ev..er..y...where. All over the radio. Used in many commercials I mean everywhere. Never knew who made it so thank you for that!
Amber I have one for you Kina ""Girl From The Gutter"" little known."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Alt Indie Rock has a lot of female leads.  Garbage, Republica, Luscious Jackson, and more.  A lot to dive into.  Enjoy."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This song came out when I was 21. It was my favorite song that year, and I wore out my cassette tape...üòÇ"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I'd really encourage you to check out 'Anthem' by Njoi - Saffron in her previous life as guest vocalist on an 80s dance classic! üï∫üé∂üé§
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Perhaps for one of your Female Fridays you could try Imogen Heap.  My fave song is RunTime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afbvd8g5hMU, otherwise Hide and Seek (one of Ariana Grande's fave song and Imogen is a HUGE fave of Ariana's). I was most impressed watching ""First Train Home"" live on David Letterman - you can see Imogen's excellent live singing voice plus her piano and other instrument skills"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,This song is used when the players from the Soccer team I support (Sunderland) come onto the pitch.  It still pumps people up!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"For female Friday check out Garbage, I‚Äôm only happy when it rains or Stupid Girl are two great songs."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,You need to listen to their track ‚ÄòDrop Dead Gorgeous‚Äô next.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"My mom had this CD and she used to play it all the time so I love this song and then I heard the song in my favorite movie scream
You guys should check out their songs out of the darkness and drop dead gorgeous"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"90's recommendation:

""Everyday Sunshine"" by Fishbone

Early 90's funk rock with lots and lots of horns. 

If you aren't up and dancing, it probably means you are dead."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Please listen to:
Boy Meets Girl - Waiting for a Star to Fall - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhxF9Qg5mOU 
Go West - King of Wishful Thinking - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBZUz4C6kqk 
Level 42 - Something about you - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKxEmuSxBc
Thank you for making us smile!!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"If you wanna hear more 90s female rock, check out Veruca Salt songs - Volcano Girls or Seether"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"The warning ,enter sandman cover. They are 3 sisters from  Mexico. They rock!!! They sing in both languages ."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Okay, well, you're gonna do bands with female singers for Female Friday, here's two of my favorites.
THE HELLFREAKS - Sabotage (Beastie Boys Cover) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bjh9_F9dOM  (This is possibly the best cover I've ever heard.
UNLEASH THE ARCHERS - Awakening (Full Band Playthrough Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUPGa15Oto"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"This song was used in National Lampoon‚Äôs Vegas Vacation, when Audrey met the fake Beatles and they all danced on the old signs in the neon graveyard."
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"Always appreciate you guys,y'all gotta do some Book Of Love (Boys,Sunny Day,I Touch Roses).You won't regret!"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,"New subscriber here: Check out Massive Attack (Black Milk, Dissolved Girl, Teardrop), The Pharcyde (Drop), Beastie Boys (Sure Shot), Fatboy Slim (Praise You, Right Here, Right Now), Daft Punk (Around The World), Deee-Lite (Groove Is In The Heart), Sneaker Pimps (6 Underground) 

All 90s. 90s was a strong decade, imo"
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS SONG!!! Love it!!!! So so so so so so so much ENERGY!!!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,I love this song! Was also in the movie Vegas Vacation. Can‚Äôt help but dance when I hear it.
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,No running playlist is complete without this song
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Oh well!!!!!!! LOVE This Song!!! And this song was played EVERYWHERE in Dance Clubs and still is being played today in Dance Clubs!!!
10,BZlswq_Pu4E,Never heard this dam she rocksüî• and her band mates also!

10,H4ypOn_-hDU,What they gonna do try to suspend him for that too. They would look stupid if they did.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Stand your ground, Kyrie!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,No more Nike and Adidas. Time to buy from our own. And the way Kyrie had put tape over the logo on his shoes is creative.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I think many will start to follow him and stand up.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Time to stop letting them monetize our talent for their gain.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Family it's time to BOYCOTT these corporations...
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I'm boycotting Nikeüò°
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"I'm lovin it! Hopefully, that brand will lose maximum support and never rise again!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Until we control our very existence we are not free Kyrie
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"If you look up ""strong black man"" in the dictionary you'll see a picture of Kyrie Irving there"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Kyrie needs to manufacture his 'I Am Free' brand. I would quite happily purchase them. Boycott Nike and Adidas people. We need to stay on code on this.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Nike probably didn't realize that nearly half the players in the NBA wear Kyrie's shoe
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Overall, the poorest folks spend the most money on those shoes. Throwing away good money trying to buy confidence."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,These companies need us way more than we need them. Believe that. B1.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Cancel, delete Nike. Can't stand with anyone who will not stand with us...."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Its rumored his team is meeting with a black clothing/shoe designer. I hope ü§ûüèæ & pray üôèüèæ they give the green light.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"I wondered why I received a Goggle questionnaire asking which Nike shoes did I recognize, as Nike shoes earlier to day.  Some sneakers had the Nike logo ripped off the shoes,  and others had the logo intact. I'm not buying any Nike shoes, Nope! üòÇü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"So, there was enough time to totally secure another (Black Owned), basketball shoe brand to wear but still a great beginning! Left arm up, fist balled, African Unity! Power to The People!!!!!!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Nike one day will regret their decision.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Much respect to kyrie, if we can all get on code, we can make a great impact. üôèüèø"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"""I AM THAT I AM.""     Is Kyrie sending out spiritual signals?"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,The shoe looks better with the tape. Kyrie may have given inspiration to a new design perhaps.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,the way they're treating him is manipulative and workplace violation
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Yes!!! Kyrie is on the right track spiritually! He sent a profound underlying message which says FREEDOM begins with a state of mind! The Most High will do the REST!! üéâ
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I would buy a pair of Kyrie Freedom Sneakers today !!!!!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I'm glad he finally got around to doing this. I just wish he did it sooner.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,He could create a shoe named KYRIE for men and women!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Great for him! All praises!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I think he was a target in the first place because why is Nikes still selling the stuff on Amazon where they selling the movie that‚Äôs supposed to be so antisemitic
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Strong brother! I am proud of him and I am not a basketball fan. What we as a society are sorely missing today: principles!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Nike mocks us the whole thing is about a Greek goddess or something like that having victory over us
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I see a business opportunity for our shoe makers!!!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"We all need to stand with Kyrie, this brother has made two stands against the jab and now Nike. Nike like many large companies only respect the bottom. Kyrie i hope you start your own sportswear company. Keep it up Kyrie, we are with you all the way."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I'm standing with kyrie Irving. He didn't do anything wrong.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"There you go Kyrie ‚ùóIf they don't want to support you, then that goes both ways ‚ÄºÔ∏è"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"So let's make shoes called ""I am Free"" that's it! We are waiting Kyrie! Let's all be free together! We actually care about the people promoting the shoes. We care Kyrie!‚ù§Ô∏è You know why others buy them? Because they see Hebrew people in them. We make stuff look cool.‚ù§Ô∏è Just keep sharing y'all."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"I CAN PROUDLY SAY I NEVER BOUGHT ANY NIKE OR ANY BRAND NAMED SNEAKER FOR ME OR MY SONS. I ALWAYS GOT BO-BOS, EVEN THO I COULD AFFORD TO BUY HIGH END SHOES. KYRIE SHOULD PLACE A CURSE ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS....BANKRUPTCY"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Stand your ground Kyrie!!! God will always have the best intentions for you.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Every time they mess up we get closer to our ""Black Goals"""
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,The politically correct way of telling nike to kiss his a#@.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"honestly nike aint been that hot wit my closet for a while now. Months back I brought a few joggers and crewneck sweaters and I got my fill of all the retro jordans and a few other signature athlete shoes I wanted when I was a kid but couldnt afford. I havent got any of them in a few years. Ultimately they just recycle the sane shyt over and over in different colors but other than that I really havent been to crazy about much they cane out with in the last few years. I cant lie I really like adidas clothes and shoes. I been going crazy with they stuff in the last few years. Ultraboost, nmd, tracksuits, joggers, shirts been everything. I never got a pair of yeezys cause I never really cared for the designs. I almost pulled the trigger on those 350 zebras cause I thought that particular colorway was fiya but I found out such a big area of em yellow over time that 300 bucks just wasnt justifiable. Even if I did like yeezys I wouldnt buy em if adidas took kanye name off em and cut him out the profits."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"These people are some hypocrites he still wanted him to wear their Nike gym shoes and advertise for free.   These Pretenders are something else but I'm glad he taped over the Nike symbol,"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Imagine is just 20 per cent of the NBA started wearing Kanyes trainers.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I'm not buying nike anymore.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Stay strong, Kyrie... My boycott continues indefinitely."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,We woke now I'm riding with Kyrie
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Skechers have been pretty good for me
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Hallelujahüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ    I hope and pray that he gets with black designer‚Äôs to create shoes solely for the black community.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Thanks Kyrie...don't be shaken...no more buying Nike
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,He could go the route that Prince went.ü§£ That would be hilarious. What rights do these men sign away when signing their contacts?
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Awesome hopefully he will be the CEO of his own shoe so no one can cancel him
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,He doesn‚Äôt need the money. And he wanted out üëçüèæ
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Yes ma'am. You are quite right. It is time we start boycotting. Kyrie did nothing wrong. Yes, we have to collectively boycott these companies. We can hurt them with our collective dollars. We must also boycott Star Bucks who consistently treat our people  like we are less and not valuable.
Thank you for your work."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Boycott Nike and Adidas!!!
Stay strong bro.
Shalawam"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"I think he should do his own shoe, he already has his KAI brand, why not do sneakers for it"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Great Job Kyrie !! Keepin it üíØ !
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,We support you Kyrie
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I'm with you Kyrie‚úäüèø
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"The new shoes should be called ""KyFree."" Or ""IrvFree,"" but I prefer ""KyFree"""
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Boycott Adidas too like boycotting Sal's Pizzeria from the motion-picture, ""Do the right thing!"""
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,While boycotting Nike I‚Äôm showing my son how to make his own shoes
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,GOOD FOR HIM.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Good for Him I'm proud of him
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Might not be hurting Nike but damn should not helping Nike either.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Challenging these devils is more than a notion. It takes a lot of heart.  I wonder if Kyrie regrets going pro and signing with satan.  There would be NO GAME NO PROFIT without Black Talent.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Let's do something right now everybody that's done with  Nike say I'm done
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"DO NOT EVER GIVE IN FAM, THIS NEEDS TO BE A PERMANENT BAN ON NIKE."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"We need our own brand of everything out there‚Ä¶., like a FUBU approach on things"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"The last time I wore Nike when I was in Mumford High School when I played varsity football when I had Nike football cleats.   I was never into name brand gym shoes and don't care for them as a matter of fact I really don't give a damn about name brand clothes,"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Nike and all of the ""Nike"" brands. May the Creator continue to bless he and Mr. Dalton too!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Praise God!!! He had one eye simbolism in one of the design. I am so glad
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,He should collaborate with Ye or SIA or any other black company that can produce sneakers.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Sia Collective a black designer reached out to Kyrie and his team via IG. His post went viral and people got it in front of Kyrie's team and now has a meeting scheduled. üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ and excited for your new beginnings Kyrie.
Shalom!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Kyrie Irving support make own brand shose don't need Nike at all
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Amen amen for Kyrie and his decision to post N2H. TMH is moving in ways we could never imagine..
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Perception, if the black community start a boycott and from there follow a world movement then nike will suffer stockwise. A shame for the black NBA players who think they are not in the slaughter line‚Ä¶"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Time to bring Nike to Nike's knee's.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,We've enriched nike enough. Been a Nike sneaker head for many years now. I play basketball too but I'm done. That's it. It's time we build and consume our own brands. Imagine a Kyrie navy blue tee with matching orange Kyrie sneakers ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,He should put a deal together with Ye or Master P to wear the sneakers they make.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,It would be a major blow to Nike if Michael Jordan would step up and denounce Nike. That  would send a message WE ARE NOT TO BE PLAYED WITH. SEND THIS TO JORDAN....
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"The fact he still wearing Nike shoes shows this is a Psy-Op.
There is no need to keep wearing Nike shoes if he no longer under contract with them. He could easily wear another brand.
This whole Kyrie and Ye thing is a Psy-Op and it has ZERO to do with H2N or even Yisrael being black...but the Beast kingdom is near
There is a huge agenda the Elites is pushing into play, but most only look at the surface of things"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"This man decided to stand on his feet, as his own person, as a real man, than to kiss ass, and live on his knees!! Case closed!!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Kyrie simply (& only) pointed at a guy carting a _supposed_ *nuke* around in a radio flyer; neither the *nuke* or its hauler are detained; Kyrie on the other hand, is dragged out into the public square, placed in stocks, stripped, and flogged; then he's told his name is Toby in 6 lessons, and asked, 
""What has he learned?"""
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Good for him! I might do it too.
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Kyrie Irving is free spiritually knowing he is an Israelite. The truth shall make you free. He forsake everything, sacrifice his career and the bondage of Nike, for the most high YAH APTTMHY ."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,All Praises To The Most High ‚ù§Ô∏è
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"The funny thing is he redesign the sneaker with his own logo. LOL thats a straight up slap to Nike,, he just made a new shoe put his name where the logo sign is and keep the other shoe with I am free thank God . That will sale  fast."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Well, here's the sad part.our people as a whole will continue to be a drone to not only Nikey,also other fashion designer's that do our people wrong, treat them horribly."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Never been into name brands I‚Äôve seen the need to wear another person name or symbol on my clothing I‚Äôve never been into free advertising
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I need those shoes or when he creates his own...plus when enough people r on code watch Nike's stock go down. See what Nike will say\do
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"He should hire a shoe designer, buy a building and hire some good workers to make his shoes."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,Boycott Nike and it‚Äôs affiliated companies! Make this happen!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,The Most High God bless and keep Kyrie. People keep him cover in pray!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,I have not bought a nike in 30 years! Thank god!
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Time to move on 
Make and support our own 
Win win for us. The beginnings of our EMPOWERMENT!!!!"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,No he can't wear Nike no more just like we can't wear Nike no more okay we can't wear it okay they've done this to themselves okay so we can't follow Nike no more that's a wrap
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Yeah , this is the saddest part of it all , we , excuse me, they will continue to buy Nike , just not made with that kind of push back, I wouldn't be surprised if the sales didn't increase , because our people are so thirsty for MASSA'S brand and approval..."
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"33 Points
The brand has no effect on the skill of user.
Take a :H  I  K  E'
You need W E"
10,H4ypOn_-hDU,"Boycott Nike, everyone isn't down with the cause because I hear dudes at work talking about man I'm about to get the new Nike this or Nike that. These are the types that are worldly and not paying attention to what's going on in our community or they know and just don't care, I stay away from these type."

10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"It Is Most DEFINITELY A Love Song..While Carole Has A Lot Of Classic Hit Songs,, She Also Wrote MANY Songs For Other Artists As Well..A Truly Gifted Singer/Songwriter."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Brad & Lex, you'll love her ""So Far Away"", ""Jazzman""and ""Sweet Seasons!!!! 
Great singer songwriter, whose classic album ""Tapestry"" is in my top 5 of all-time! She plays piano.
edit- her heart was tremblin' because he rocked her World üòç"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She's one of the all-time great songwriters, with over 100 of her songs entering the Billboard Top 100."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King wrote a bunch of hits for other artists in the sixties -- ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" for  the Shirelles, ""Up on the Roof"" for the Drifters, ""One Fine Day"" for the Chiffons, ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" for the Monkees, ""I'm into Something Good"" for Herman's Hermits, ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"" for Aretha Franklin --  and that's just for starters."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Yes, it's a love song. She's explaining the butterflies in the stomach type feeling when you're around that special person...she's just expressing those feelings in a dramatic way. 
Carole King is one of the great song writers. The album ""Tapestry"" was on repeat when I was a kid!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,This one of the MUST HAVE albums back in the good old days.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"You have no idea how huge the album Tapestry was in the 70's! üî•üî•üî•. Carol King is a goat of singer song writers. Everyone loves her RnB fans, rockers it don't matter."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She too is now in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with Pat Benatar.
If you want to hear Pats true beautiful voice, listen to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let it Show‚Äú. Her voice goes way beyond in this one!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,The analogies and descriptions are hyperboles and serve to express her overwhelming feelings of love. Classic song.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Love song - makes you weak and you can't help yourself. Shakes you up like an earthquake and disorients you. Not dark but how love can make you feel.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"This was one of the first 5 albums I remember hearing around my home as a wee lad...and this is my favorite song from King/the album.  One of the biggest shocks you'll ever see will be when you check out how many songs Carole has written.  Like Neil Diamond, there are a TON of hits..a ton of hits she wrote for others...and a bunch of EXCELLENT deep cuts you've never heard of before (and never knew Carole King wrote).   She's so much bigger than her own albums (which are legendary)."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carole's piano tone is always on point!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King, one of the greatest song writers from the Brill Building which had the likes of Paul Simon and Neil Sedaka. Neil is another Singer/ Songwriter well worth looking into, very talented."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"This was one of the first songs where Carole wrote the lyrics.  She had a long history of writing melodies to others' lyrics, most famously Gerry Goffin."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She is a great writer of music. She was known for her writing abilities before her singing carreer.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Her album Tapestry spent 15 weeks at No 1. And stayed on the LP charts for nearly six years .
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Thank you Wikipedia    ¬†
Carole King‚Äôs  Tapestry album has been certified 14√ó Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in the US,[5] and has sold an estimated 30 million copies worldwide,[6] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In 2000, it attained number 74 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums,[7] and in 2020, it was ranked number 25 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[8] Tapestry won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.   Please do not try to over analyse her song     she is a world famous songwriter and this is a love song she wrote.   One of many great songs on this wonderful album"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Sorry Brad, there's no darkness in this song. It's a love song, pure and simple, describing how love makes her feel"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carole King and Gerry Goffin were a songwriting team that The Beatles actually aimed to emulate.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,One of the greatest singer/songwriters of all time. They made a musical about her called ‚ÄúBeautiful ‚Äú. Thank you for your reaction
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She‚Äôs a living Legend. Prolific songwriter.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"One of the best live performances I've ever seen is Aretha Franklin singing Carole King's ""You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman"" at Carole's Kennedy Center Honors tribute"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"""Okay. I think she loves him."" LOL. Thank you for finally solving that great enigma of a lyrical mystery by listening to the rest of the song. I'm just gonna say it. You're weird. But entertaining. And very creative. You would have been a fun student to have in my class. Last night I had chicken soup with rice for dinner. It was so good. It reminded me of a song by Carole King called, of all things, Chicken Soup With Rice. I've seen a lot of reactors do Carole King songs but I have not seen any do that song. It's the right time of the year for it. All the best."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,It was nice of someone to record this from vinyl to give us the needle noise nostalgia.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Great song from the classic LP Tapestry.  Carol King co-wrote dozens of Top 40 hits before she started recording herself.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Another awesome tune from an awesome album. Huge talent. Love and lust is what it's about. April showers brings May flowers. Remember that saying?
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carol  is also playing all the piano on all her music while singing..whichbalways impresses me.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Since the live the other night this song has been stuck in my head. It's been awhile since I heard it before CK is one of my fav songwriters and she has this weirdly old voice that I love when she actually sings
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She had been working at the Brill Building in NYC, where they had writers, musicians, and singers, as well as 168 music industry businesses. It was very much an industrial model. She moved to California where the singer songwriter movement was totally different."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole is an awesome talent. Her album ""Tapestry"" was owned by EVERYONE. Not a bad song on it."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Gotta react to ""So Far Away"" live from BBC on February 10, 1971... James Taylor joins her on guitar.üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King's ""Tapestry"" LP was rated the number 25 best LP of all time by Rolling Stone, and won 4 grammys.  The lady was a total musician /songwriter 5:48, Lex you're soo funny with your synopsis!!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King wrote this song after reading Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. There is a famous passage in that novel where the main character feels the earth move as he and a woman make love. Check it out. Great song, great novel."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"One of my other favorites is ""Up on the Roof"" which was also recorded by James Taylor."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Great song and I get it , when you see someone who absolutely takes your heart everytime you see them"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She sees him and just goes all funny inside. You two seem like you know that feeling.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She spent a lifetime writing some of the most popular and memorable songs of the 1960s for artists ranging from the Shirells and the Drifters to Herman's Hermits and the Monkees. The Beatles covered her song ""Chains"" (already a hit for an american band, the Cookies) on their first British album Please Please Me. Lennon and McCartney's collaboration was originally inspired by the success of Carole and her then husband, Gerry Goffin.

You should make time to watch the 1996 film ""Grace of My Heart."" The main character, played by Illiana Douglas, is loosely based on Carole King and her life in music. Not exactly a biopic, but brilliantly conceived as a trip through the musical world of the late 50s through the early 70s through the eyes of a woman who is one of the most prolific songwriters of her generation, writing hit after hit for all of the great acts of the time, until she gets the opportunity to write and perform one of the great albums of all time."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Y'all are so funny!  You put today's fears in yesterday's songs ... it's okay, that's what you know, but we weren't thinking that way.  It was definitely a love song, i you have a chance rea all the lyrics again and you will see.  Thanks for the memories.  God bless you."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She's been a great gift to our world. Wonderful.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,One of the best songwriters of all time. Her songwriting spanned the Brill Building all the way through the rest of the century.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,The passion she feels for this person cause her to have an intense reaction.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Produced by the great Lou Adler. Carole is in the Top 10 best songwriters of all time, man or woman. AND a fine piano player who can sing too.üòÆ"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,‚ÄúWhere You Lead‚Äù from this album is one of my all time favorite songs
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"""I feel the earth move"" derives from Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls from 1940.
When American dynamite expert Robert Jordan joins the Spanish Civil War, he meets Maria in the mountains. After they make love, she asks him. - Did you feel the earth move? It's only true love if you feel the earth move.
All American students had read Hemingway when Carole King was young."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"I think Brad is over thinking it.  ""Mellow as the month of May"" is just a nice alliterative lyric choice.  Great classic tune."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Still on my fave list even after all these years!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Hay Brad always remember in these old songs. The world had a completely different language then. The earth moving under your feet was commonly used when you see someone who was just perfect to you. We are going to have start teaching you to just go with the follow. Another term of those golden days.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Great song writer and very solid entertainer... Under the radar hit for her was ""Hard Rock Cafe!"""
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Oh my God it‚Äôs a love song. She‚Äôs talking about how he makes her feel on the inside whenever he‚Äôs around her. Didn‚Äôt you feel that way when you first met Lexi
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Yes, it's a love song! How on earth do you get that bizarre negative inference from it Brad?"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Saw her at the Spokane Opera house around 1979 or so. Lovely concert.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"One of the MOST PROLIFIC songwriters in the business... The album TAPESTRY (on which this sing is found) was on the charts for YEARS... Brad, Bruh, you have a perspective like no one else I've ever heard... This song is about crazy love, and you're talking about the end of the world üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ.."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She is one helluva song writer.  She wrote ""You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman""  that was a hit for Aretha Franklin.  That's just one or many hits she's written over the years,"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"What you seem not to know is that Carole King is one of the greatest songwriters in rock history, perhaps just one step below the Beatles.  King was only a composer and not a performer until 1970, so her greatest work is not songs she performed, but songs she wrote that were performed by others.  Her hits include:

""Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"" 
""One Fine Day,"" 
""The Locomotion,"" 
""Go Away Little Girl,"" 
""I'm Into Something Good,"" 
""Take Good Care of My Baby,"" 
""Up on the Roof,""  

and many other fabulous hits."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,One of the all time great songwriters. Tapestry is one of the great all time rock albums.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Oh please listen to her whole album tapestry.   Carol King is insaninly awesome.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King and her then-husband Jerry Goffin were big time song writers back in the 1960s.  Their daughter, Louise Goffin, put out an album in the late 1970s or early 80s.  She's still performing and putting out albums."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Anyway you can, give a listen to her Tapestry album, the entire thing....what a great time for music!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,""" Tapestry "" is one of the best albums ever! #25 on Rolling Stone top 500!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Back in the 70's it seemed like everyone had a copy of Carol King Tapestry. That album was full of hits.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,she is a musical genius.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"You guys you guys you guys. Shaking my head. That is hilarious. Brad initially Miss interprets tumbling and turns it into crumbling and says it might be an abusive relationship and then it turns out Lex must be the most patient woman in the world because she knows it's love song She's like? Let's just see what happens by the end of the song. You guys kill me man.

This came out when I was in grade school and it was on the radio a lot and I tell you what, I was already starting to move from classical music on the piano into Scott joplin, the early Ragtime black dude from the turn Century who has been called the American chopin, that's how gifted he was. And strangely I loved Chopin of all the classical people the most. But anyway, this came on and it has so much heavy syncopation and all that piano in it and and I love her voice I love how sexy it is I love how she plays with it and I just fell in love with this song. I really had a crush on this singer even though I knew nothing about her at all nothing. No visual image no history. Just her voice singing this song to this very well arranged song. I loved it. It was great to hear it again it made me want to dance for sure."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole King is 80 now and still performing,  I believe."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,When my wife calls me on my phone that is the ringtone I hear. Always glad to take a moment to speak to her.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carole could rock!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Tapestry will go down as one of the greatest albums of all time!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Brad it's like your world implodes with the excitement of being in the presence of your one. Clearly in love. Excitement
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Oh, Brad, so literal. The sky is tumbling because of her emotional/sexual desire. Same with her trembling heart."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Carole was going thru or just had gotten divorced and her answer was the album 'Tapestry' which is about her during that time. It is an album that has to be listened to from beginning to end..other songs: #1 song, It's Too Late (Record of the Year)- #1, song sung by James Taylor,You've Got A Friend  (Song of the Year)- Natural Woman sung by Aretha - etc.. Grammy album of the Year a JEM..."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Tapestry is a legendary album
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,I've always thought this would make a cool pop-punk cover for some band. Replace the piano with a crunchy guitar.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She's amazing. You two might check out the  musical based on her called ""Beautiful ""."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Tapestry.   Classic must have fantastic album!  I've had since early 70's.  ‚ù§.  Don't over think it, just enjoy!!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Always interesting how Brad reads into things‚Ä¶
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Eric Johnson, the great guitarist played in her band before he was famous on his own."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Writing hit songs over 5 decades should put you firmly in SOME Hall of Fame for petes sake.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carole King was huge back in the dayü•Åüé∏üé∫
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She was a song writing machine
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,She wrote...You've got a friend..James Taylor.. try So far away.   Love ‚ù§Ô∏è yall!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"She always sings a little off key, which added to the huskiness of her voice is kind of a good thing IMHO."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"For a Carole King song watch  Aretha Franklin absolutely kill ""Natural Woman"" at the Kennedy Centre - moved Obama to tears and got everyone up and screaming."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Happiest of holidays to you both and yours!!!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"And now: Judee Sill's ""The Kiss"" live please!!!"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Huge hit early to mid 70's!  BRAD, there is NOTHING NEGATIVE about this song.  He makes her heart flutter just to be around him.  Do you not know anything about women?  Is it your culture, your education, or just you?  It's hard to watch, I'll say that.  Just sayin'."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Had a girlfriend and Tapestry was the only album she had. We wore it out.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,In 1971 everyone had this album
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"...""Class of 76""...Linda Ronstadt, Karen Carpenter and now Carole King...while making out and listening to all of these great female vocalist did I EVER have my lady pull away and think any of these songs were about abusive relationships...But who knows...maybe they were lost in my passion and just oblivious to the songs deep, dark meanings...along with me?"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Reading way too much into this. She's getting her world rocked. Tumbling, not crumbling."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Sound is ‚Ä¶.nice analogue crackles from the vinyl‚Ä¶.get that warm feeling from this song
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Carol made it very clear that Laura Nyro was either  above or at least on her level!
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"Come on Brad and Lex üòÖ, you know about the Great Stuff, the Mussssic, thanks for the Classics, Carol Awesome Singer. Now Lex some of the Hippie Mischievous, Cleverness, Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è Classic Witt."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"The mere title explained it... back in the day, you couldn't say things straight out in public. ""The Earth moved"" meant an orgasm."
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,My mom had Tapestry one of the greatest albums of all time
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Listen to Tapestry album. You are not listening with the mind of the 70s. This is a song about giving into the great feelings love brings. All positive.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"I know it‚Äôs a love song,  but I live in California,  and we definitely feel the earth move‚Ä¶.Earthquakes"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Don't know why but when I hear Carole King I'm reminded of Fiona Apple and vise versa.
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,"its a good tremble, like being somewhere and your crush walks in the room then ya`ll are face to face, how do you feel?"
10,gp-6tsIo5vc,Come on Brad--it's not dark...you are very confused on the lyrics.  She's crazy in love in a good way.

J'ai eu les larmes aux yeux quand je l'ai √©cout√© la premi√®re fois
Maitenant je l'√©coute en boucle
Ces 5 enfants ont vraiment un talent hors du commun et savent tr√®s bien passer des magnifiques messages
Je suis fan d'eux depuis la premi√®re note de leur voix sur le clip de ma tendresse

10,aXK2mTUVUuk,What a magnificent and heartfelt piece. Very fitting. We should all come together to help each other out in this time of crisis. I like the rubato.  I also love the vocal technique. I can tell that the song is written to be quite challenging for vocalists in that the tonal lines go up at points where the theme is kind of dark. There's always the question of whether the vocal cords will tense up at such a moment. My hat's off to you.
10,aXK2mTUVUuk,"Merci pour cette belle chanson, ce que vous faites est vraiment g√©niale 
Je suis fi√®re de vous pour ce que vous faites vous √™tes g√©niaux"

10,aXK2mTUVUuk,Honestly this song is SO amazing and beautiful!! It deserves WAY more views! More people need to see this and hopefully child labour will end soon!

10,aXK2mTUVUuk,"Esta canci√≥n me lleg√≥ mucho ya que yo estoy estudiando para ser maestra de primaria y... Considero que... Esta canci√≥n me invita a ser emp√°tica y acabar con el trabajo infantil, ayudando a ni√±os que no tienen nisiquiera para comprar los √∫tiles m√≠nimos necesarios para estudiar, o que no tienen ni para comer. Me encantan Kids United Nouvelle Generation y gracias por la canci√≥n y la reflexi√≥n. Saludos desde M√©xico üá≤üáΩ"
10,aXK2mTUVUuk,"Eure Lieder und Clips sind tats√§chlich sehr nahegehend. Ich h√∂re sie sehr gern zum Beispiel auch w√§hrend meiner Arbeit am Computer, w√§hrend der Schichtdienste, zu Hause am Schreibtisch, w√§hrend ich mich auf das Schreiben meiner neuen Artikel konzentriere. Eure Lieder sind f√ºr viele Gelegenheiten eine Wohltat f√ºr die Seele, gerade auch in unseren Zeiten :-)
Das Lied  j'imagine (Clip Officiel) war auch f√ºr mich besonders in der letzten Passage ... nach der deutschen √úbersetzung ... ad hoc √ºberw√§ltigend. Das ist eine sehr zu Herzen gehende Perfektion. Die Tiefgr√ºndigkeit der wundervollen Barbara Pravi und umgesetzt von einer nicht weniger wundervollen, sehr gef√ºhlvollen S√§ngerin wie Valentina. Ich bin mir sicher, da√ü war ""echt"" , die nat√ºrliche Valentina (hinter dem Text) und nicht ""nur"" geschauspielert... . ;-)  Dies macht eine liebensw√ºrdige, erfolgreiche S√§ngerin aus.
Erwachsene werden mit dieser (positiven) Schockwirkung umgehen k√∂nnen aber Jugendliche und Kinder, vielleicht in weniger guten Welten ihrer Vorstellung lebend, werden eventuell Eure Unterst√ºtzung ben√∂tigen. Wenn sie versuchen, die ihnen im Clip gereichte Hand (Valentinas) zu ergreifen ... : Lasst sie in ihren Emotionen dann nicht alleine sondern gebt ihnen Zusammenhalt, das Gef√ºhl von echter Freundschaft untereinander, mit Euch (auch in der Ferne). 
Lenkt die Emotionen auf Eure Mission f√ºr Kids United, selbst auch Hilfe f√ºr andere Kinder zu sein und schon schlie√üt sich der Kreis auch f√ºr die hier in Europa / anderswo in weniger sch√∂nen Verh√§ltnissen Lebenden. :-)"

10,8vNeI_luGj0,We need a petition to get Ola on-stage for one of the Europe gigs.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I think this shows Charlie is criminally underrated especially in this genre.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"i was lucky enough to see pantera live a handful of times way back, Dime didn't always play the solos exactly like the recorded versions. people just relax a little"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Charlie is THE man! The fact that we could all hear straight away how good it sounded from that first gig, shows he's done his homework, and it has to be tough for anyone playing Pantera because we all know how elitest the fanbase can be. Finding that fine line between learning the songs as himself and also delivering the Pantera sound is the key, I believe Charlie has arrived and cemented himself on that line with pride."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"In all fairness, Charlie has always been on point with all his covers. His Rush, Zeppelin covers speak for themselves too."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,They are doing the brothers justice. Everyone should be proud.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Completely badass. I really hope they do their own tour in the states so I don't have to pay Metallica ticket prices.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,they sound better than the first night Im sure the more they play the better it will sound
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Its gotta be even better live...cant wait to be in the crowd listening.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,If we can get Ola up there for 1 song for a Sweden show‚Ä¶ That would make his damn day.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Zakk tightened up the I'm Broken solo...I was surprised...he captured the essence of it so it was great. Hope he continues to tighten the material up...Charlie is 100% nailing it, same with Phil and Rex."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Charlie is an amazing drummer, it's nice to know he's brought such love and passion to this project. Anthrax forever!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Zakk's not doing anything different to filling in Randy's shoes with Ozzy. Does it with total respect and puts himself into it. And Charlie is absolutely brilliant to give Zakk the framework to do though - totally retaining the sound of Pantera. Having seen multiple Pantera tours back in the day I'm so so so enjoying hearing Pantera live again - bring it to Australia! This music needs to be heard and celebrated.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I agree with you Ola 100%. Im 39 years old and hearing Pantera songs being played live again is freakin amazing to me!! Hearing these songs again brings me back to my teenager days..Im soo hyped about this tour and cant wait till they come here next year. To the people that are hating on this, walk on home boy!! Pantera 4ever! #RIP Vinnie and Dime."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I LOVE seeing how happy Ola is watching these clips.  It's so genuine   to see someone share his passion for the music.  Thanks for sharing these.  We know you dont like ""reaction videos"" but this seems so natural for you Ola!!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I mirror your thoughts. I‚Äôm 50 now, but seeing and hearing this has brought me to a place I cannot quite explain. I don‚Äôt feel like a kid again, but it renews my passion for this music and freshens my memories of how much I loved seeing Pantera live. No one else put in shows like Pantera. Additionally, I have so much love and gratitude for Charlie and Zakk. So many great songs over so many years. Charlie, prob my biggest influence as a drummer. Zakk is just a badass. I think this entire ‚Äútribute‚Äù is incredible."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,This whole Pantera...tribute...if that's what it's being called...in my honest opinion......is....just f****n AMAZING!!!! Not only do us now oldies get another shot at their music live...but it opens the door to probably the best band in any metal genre ... EVER...to a new younger generation....LONG MAY IT CONTINUE..BTW  Zak is doing am awesome job!!!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I'm so happy that Benante is getting more recognition for his insane skills. Charlie is the reason I started playing drums as a kid. Watched the big 4 dvd and he was the coolest dude I'd ever seen and I had to be like him. Seeing how much love he's getting makes me happy.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I'm shocked at how good Phil is sounding, it's insane."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Man, I've been to Phil's Pantera tribute show with The Illegals, and it was very emotional. Now this thing, I'd love to see, but I tell ya, when you're there and they play those songs, it's like you said, very heavy. Full support and respect to guys for bringing Pantera's music back to people"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Can we take a moment and appreciate how good Phil's voice is after all he's been through? See, the difference between Phil, who's voice has aged and someone like Vince Neal, or DLR is that he actually practices and gives a sh*t. Does he have his 90's voice? No, obviously, as he's aged, but he's doing a damn good job. Hats off to Phillip F***king Anselmo."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I‚Äôm just so happy to see Phil this good. So so so happy for him! 
Definitely can‚Äôt wait to see ‚Äòem all live, the effort that has been put in this is showing strong.
Worked hard to afford the tickets and, for what has been shown until now, I don‚Äôt regret it."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Most of all this is amazing for the younger generation, like me, who never got to experience pantera. So this tribute means so much, its all about the music and i'm sure dime and vinnie (after some thought) would get behind this."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Congrats on #1 guitar content youtuber!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Keep bringing us the Pantera news and views brother! I haven't been this happy about music in a long time. There's just something about seeing and hearing them that tugs at the heart strings. It's a wide array of emotions tbh. This is exactly how music is supposed to feel and I'm eating it up ü§ò
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was there yesterday, first time hearing them (at least half the band) live. I can die happy now. :)"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I love what they're doing. The first song I heard them play gave me chills man. I've been a huge Pantera fan since the early 90's and have no words really to describe how fucking cool it was to hear it live again. üëè
10,8vNeI_luGj0,These songs were meant for a arena sound! I don‚Äôt care is Zakk plays note for note these songs are sounding amazing! Just good to hear them again in this environment!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Brings a tear to my eye when the tribute rolled out. It‚Äôs great for them and emotionally healthy to get up and go! Rex and Phil have some shit to deal with and thanks for bringing back Pantera!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"The combo of Dime's riffs and Zakk's noodling is the BEST.  This is the best gig I've ever heard Zakk play.  

Charlie is absolutely nailing it.  Phil and Rex haven't lost a step.  Just incredible.  It gives me hope and joy seeing this."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"What‚Äôs funny is dime played his solos a bit different from the studio tracks, so hearing zakk play them sounds good enough imo"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Charlie is a true professional and such an amazing person! His work so far is incredible with this new lineup!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,They all sound incredible! Im super impressed with Phils vocals though. Sounds awesome!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Charlie is such a cool down to Earth dude. He even answered my FB messsges as a random Anthrax fan, he even told me what was the approach they followed when songwriting. As much as he is cool as a person, he is a hell of a drummer and he is being one of the most professional musicians behind this pantera gig."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I only got to see Pantera live twice, Ozz Fest and The Reinventing The Steel Tour.  I got to say, the energy is there. It ""feels"" very Pantera. üëèüëèüëè"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I wish they would do a legit concert recording :'( this is killing me
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I've been a Pantera fan since 1990. This sounds sick! Charlie and Zakk are killing it.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"The fact that Charlie is using ""big drum sizes"" similar to Vinnie's drum size instead of his own usual drum kit makes the drum sounds great. I did not expect that. Bravo"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was there last night!, it was truly unbelievable, everyone sounded espectacular and Phil voice was on point, I can‚Äôt imagine how it was to see them live with the Abbott brothers"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Charlie absolutely nailed it!! Vinnie had some big shoes to fill and they fit Charlie like a glove. üòéü§ò
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"""Hear the Drummer  Get Wicked!"" Charlie always brings it"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was on the Mexico Hell and Heaven first show and it was just Amazing. Drums were brutal, Bass sounded really cool, and guitar it obviusly had a big Zakk touch but it didnt interfered with what it was supposed to be  he just nailed it and everyone was playing attention to Zakk every solo to see if he was the man for the job and he just destroyed us all with pure talent. And the most surprising thing was how good Phil sounded, he delivered  an amazing performance, never seen an after pantera days performance as good as this shows. I cried the whole show because I never thought I could see Pantera ever for obvious reasons but for those complaining if this is or not the real pantera just go and youll have the time of your life, now thousands of people can confirm it."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"they're doing excellent job!. I was born in 1985 and thanks to my sister being a huge panther fan, I've been lucky enough to grow up with cowboys from hell blaring from her room, her whole room full of pantera posters and music over the years
as i got older i immediately became a fan of pantera, but i don't know why especially dimebag and vinnie, and those posters and all those memorabilia are now with me in my rehearsal space.
When I found out that Zakk and Charlie were going to play the illusion of hearing those songs live, I overflowed. As expected the work they are doing is excellent ‚úä"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I remember that day when Dime was killed, was very sad for days about this. Glad to see Rex and Phil doing this and with company of such legends like Charlie and Zakk."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I love watching your reactions to these because I'm the exact same way.  40, giddy as the N64 kid.  

I'm just so happy we have this, I got over zakk being zakk pretty quickly.  I know dime would want zakk to just let it rip and not fret over perfection.  Hell dime had that video talking into the mirror basically saying music shouldn't be perfect, it should feel alive and moving.

But that said, I feel like zakk is already doing a better job this second show.  I feel like the leads are closer to dimes feel than the first show."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"They are all sounding incredible,Charlie is just kicking ass,zakk is doing amazing for the amount of time they had and ifs so good to see rex and Phil getting on these days and doing their brothers proud"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I just love how you show your love for Pantera, thank you. I saw them back in the days opening for Megadeth and they absolutely shredded 'em.. I enjoy this tribute so much, let's just honour this fantastic songs played with heart and soul‚ù£Ô∏èü§òüòú‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üé∏üé∂‚ú®"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Ola! Why aren‚Äôt you playing a few of these shows. I have literally never known or seen anyone as dedicated to Dimes playing, tone, and getting every note right. 
IMO that gig was yours. I‚Äôd love to see you on stage slaying these songs. ü§òüèª"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Ola, you are so wholesome. We have watched you for years as a family and when you were playing along with the video, you can see how much you adore it. Keep it up!! <3"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I'm an old die hard Pantera fan and i LOVE it! üî•
10,8vNeI_luGj0,After seeing several videos I will pass for the simple fact Zakk cant help but play that pinch harmonic he has used thru out his career in dimes music. So much to being as close to Dime as possible!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Dude, I‚Äôm so excited for this! I‚Äôve saw Pantera proper 14 times back when I was a teenager and in my 20‚Äôs between 1993 & 2001, best live band I‚Äôve ever seen and my favorite band all time. I‚Äôm excited as shit to see this and I‚Äôm excited for the kids that never got to experience Pantera. Charlie is killing it and Zak is Zak. Rex, the unsung hero is doing his thing and honestly, Phil sounds better than he has in a long time from the clips I‚Äôve seen. Anywho, rant over, getcha pull, CFH forever!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"These guys nailed it. Period! It is funny how YT is full of smart-a..es that wasn't even born when Pantera was active. Benante is killing it, Zakk is killing it. Even Dime wasn't playing those solos precisely, note for note, when he was live in concert. It was mostly solo + impovisations by himself. Can't wait for them to come to Europe tour \m/ There's no more bands like this."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Charlie Benante is a fucking Legend, best drummer in metal for me and such a cool guy, brilliant guitarist aswell and he writes the majority of Anthrax's music and guitar riffs.
I spoke with him at the Anthrax concert in Newcastle a few months ago as he came off the tour bus, got my pic with him and he came back outside to see me with a drumstick and special Anthrax custom picks. Charlie is the bestüíØüôèü§ò"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"omg this is the best YT channel ever ... how could I have lived without you, Ola!  :)"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I got to see Pantera back in 2001 on their ""Reinventing the Steele"" tour so this brings back such nostalgia and gives me chills! I love it! Pantera was the group that got me into music as well back in my teens. RIP Dime & Vinnie üñ§ü§òüèª"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"If this is 
‚ÄúReal Pantera‚Äù or not the thought of seeing these songs live again is awesome. I just hope they do a proper U.K. tour that includes Belfast, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to see Pantera back in the day and this feels me with youthful enthusiasm. Great vid by the way."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"""I feel like I'm a teenager again"". I think that's what we're all feeling right now. Exactly. This is definitely a moment. Let's cherish every second!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"IMO Anthrax is the most underappreciated band of all time. really cool that benante is the guy on this one. seems like he's doing a great job. I've always loved his drumming. I always say, no band makes me headbang like anthrax does!!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I've discovered Pantera for myself several years after Dimebag's death. One of my favorite bands ever, I would lose a kidney (or two) just to watch Phil singing those songs with some random music band accompanying him. And now, there's Rex. Moreover, Charlie and Zakk, really close Darrells friends, are also there to honor their legacy. Stop complaining guys, calm down and enjoy!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Man, this gets me psyched to see pantera songs live for the first time. Hats off Ola, great content of your genuine love for the band and songs. Are you the Dave grohl of metal?! ü§òü§ò legend!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"This is a great representation of the appreciation of OLAs love for the band. We all want/wanted to see these guys before life took hold. If you want to be a hater, then don't go to the show. It's that simple. Obviously everyone would love all 4 members to be playing. As we have been given, we have close to 4/4 members. Just cos Zak is Dimes best mate, doesn't mean he is going to play Dimes maddest solos, squeals. He will give it a fukn good go, and also add the Zak component. Why be sad about that? Charlie has literally played vicariously and given us Vinnie for real. Charlie was adamant, he was going to be playing the best sound for the band! Rex and Phil seriously just smashed it, cos it's them! They know the routine!!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Everyone did great but I personally gotta give major props to Phil. He's sounding better in these clips than he ever did in the past 10 or so years.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I really love how they‚Äôre shoehorning different songs as endings just as an extra treat. Best tribute tour of all time and it‚Äôs only 2 shows in. Pantera come to Tennessee please !!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I love these reactions!!! They are going to sound so tight by the time they get to us!! I bought my tickets for the show in Seattle ü§üüèªü§üüèª these guys are sounding really good!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"As someone born in the mid 90's, I never got to see Pantera live or hear these songs live. I'm incredibly thrilled to get the opportunity to watch next year. This will be a pipe dream come true. I understand it's not the same guys, but 75% of the music I listen to have had line up changes over the years. Metallica without Jason Newstead, Ozzy without Randy Rhodes, Warrant without Jani Lane and shit you can't even watch journey with Steve Perry for year s now. Now you have Motley Crue without Mick Mars live, it's all amazing music and I'm happy to be alive to experience it."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I can't wait to see them man. these songs deserve to be played! I wanna give Zakk and Charlie a huge hug man
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"In early 2021 I met a young lady playing in a Guns N' Roses cover band on the third Chris Jericho cruise.  I was dressed like a wrestler named Mick Foley (my profile picture is actually me and Jericho).  Emily Ruvidich was kind enough to ask for a picture with me and I went on to catch her other shows on the boat and chat with her and her boyfriend, also in the music business.  They alluded to a big project for Emily but I think she signed an NDA and couldn't tell me specifically, but just told me to watch.  I've followed her career ever since and she became Till Lindemann's (Rammstein) guitarist.  Fast forward to 2022 and Till's band was in the slot just before Pantera played in Mexico.  So essentially she just opened for Pantera's first reunion/tribute show.  I'm so proud of her.

I stopped playing guitar myself around 15-20 years.  Seeing a young person like her succeed through hard work really motivated me and I purchased a Solar Guitars A2.7C LH (black lefty 7 string) upon the suggestion of my supervisor.  The speed at my guitar was shipped and the quality I got for the price both blew me away.  I have no illusions of ever being a great guitarist but for a midlife crisis jamming along to YouTube tracks brings me some joy when I come home from work."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I never saw Pantera back in the day.
Im excited they're doing these gigs!
The haters weren't going to the show anyways!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Thanks Ola! Bringing back lots of good memories for me as well. I believe the first time I saw them was 1993 or 1994 in Vancouver...had a bit too much fun in my 20's. Incredible live band.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Phil sounds the best I've heard him in years. I was lucky enough to see Pantera live three times in their peak . I gotta say the ""tribute "" sounds really really good"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"It's kinda cool seeing Zakk playing those heavy Pantera riffs though. Almost looks weird...it's not quite fish-out-of-water..... but after decades seeing him only really play Zakk stuff it's just sorta like watching some alternate reality.  Like imagine if you saw James Hetfield playing in Slayer..... cool, but also weird."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I love that Pantera never tuned to exactly 440. Glad to hear that they're keeping that tradition alive.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Would love to see them vary up the setlist. Bring out gems like Message in Blood
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I got emotional during the montage too, Ola. So much history and love for the brothers. I need to catch the Arlington show."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,This Pantera coming back is huge. I believe zack and charlie playing with them is perfect. You need huge players to put these shoes. I wish they will come in town where I live soon.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,You can see how happy rex and phil are!! Also zakk sounds tighter in these clips!!! its gonna get insane!! i hope they play more trendkill in the states tho!!
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Awesome Ola!! Charlie and Zakk both are paying homage to the Abbott brothers!! I hate the ticket prices not the Tribute! Maybe we will get a ""Pantera"" tour without the Metallica Moneywall! "
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Man, you already interviewed Zakk, got a message from Charlie, you should, you must interview Phil... would be the interview of the year! I think you will be invited to go meet those guys back stage at the show you will be attending. Cheers Ola."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I consider myself Damn lucky to have seen Pantera on Vulgar and Far Beyond Tours. I was happy with that experience. However after seeing all of this new Live footage, I didn't realize how much I missed it. I'm very impressed how well Phil sounds. I want to see this Tribute to the Abbott Brothers..."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Biggest surprise for me is Phil! He is so good at vocals! He almost brings the vocals like on the albums.. Soo good! Zakk is ok,but i am tired of his wild vibrato in every moment."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"You should be invited to play a song with them. Overall I think it's a cool thing this Pantera Tribute. Rex and Phill are awesome, Charlie is really kicking ass and Zakk is Zakk, killing it on guitars. I'm sure Dimebag is proud of his buddy."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I honestly get teary eyed more videos I see, and I get what you mean. I‚Äôm giddy myself, I just hope I can see this live myself. Awesome goodness and chocolate. Lol"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Celebrate the music, always. You nailed it Ola"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Looks even more epic here. Getting teary-eyed again. I'm also 41 years old, like you Ola, and this makes me relive my teens again. It's magical.

I hope they play one show in Stockholm."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was on the fence about this tour. When I first heard about it, I thought it was really a bad idea. Like Ola, Dime was a hero of mine and a huge part of my journey as a guitar player. I just couldn't see how there could be a Pantera show without him and Vinnie Paul. While watching Ola's vid from the first Mexico show, I found myself getting emotional too. The energy is there. It's brutal. I realized then I have to go. As I live in Texas, I will be at the Dallas show. I know it will be extra special to see this show in Dime's & Vinnie's home town. Thanks Ola.."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Ola I can‚Äôt wait to see this gig, it‚Äôs been what seems a lifetime since enjoying Pantera music live, we can all use a little youth back and our emotions lifted !!!! Dime and Vinnie will definitely be present at every gig for sure ‚Ä¶.
ü§òü§ò"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I'm amazed how true the drumming is, and what a perfect sound they're producing. I've been trying to find out what his setup is on this tour, it certainly sounds like the pearl/sabian setup Vinny used, same kick/tom/snare and ride sound. Kick ass. As a drummer, i truly appreciate Charlie's attention to detail."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,Love what they're doing by keeping the legacy and music alive especially for people that never got the chance to see pantera and especially the new generation of music lovers. Only thing I would critique is Charlie saying he wanted to create new pantera songs. Personally Charlie and zakk are phenomenal musicians but aren't the Abbott Brothers and wouldn't be right. It's like Jack black saying he's going to write new ac/dc or zeppelin songs or Eric Clapton saying he's going to write new hendrix. I'm totally in favor of the tribute but leave it at that.
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was there and it was AWESOME!!!! The sound, the notes, the voice, the drums...man It felt like the whole place was going to collapse ü§ò one of the best shows ever!!!"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,So emotional... Thx to share your passion to the band with us. I am in the same mood than you. Memories... A big slice of life. Peace & love man ‚ù§ü§ò
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Zakk is Zakk, we all kind of saw that one coming. But Charlie, man... he really did completely try and embody Vinnie. vinnie had this insane combo of being super deep in the pocket but also perfectly accurate- he was like Neil Peart meets Frank Beard... he always played EXACTLY what needed to be played and never showed off just for the sake of it- even his nuts parts were absolutely flawless with no fat on them. I miss the brothers more than I could say, but Charlie has done Vinnie proud. He should be proud of himself. He's like a method actor playing a role, and he's fully lost himself in the part onstage

The way Phil harnessed his willpower to bring his voice back like he did is amazing- that takes will, and who better than the Kid himself. It'll never be what it was but goddamn these songs need to be played, and Phil and Rex still got it... we got robbed of the brothers way way too soon man. Pantera has always been the most important band to me, and thought I was kind of cynical about this, I have to admit I had a few shivers up my spine and I teared up a little. I remember the heat from logo on my face over 20 years ago and I can still almost feel that power surging through me... nothing will ever make me feel like that music did"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"One thing about this second riff from New Level-this sharp accents should be played as ""up"" picking. Look for videos how Dime is playing them.
This up pick move is what makes it so "" groovy"" and tight.
Can You check how Zakk is playing that part please?"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,how could you complain about this. they sound fucking amazing. charlie is killing it and i have a new respect for Zack. Phil sounds amazing i love this
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I absolutely love this. I am soon 34 years old, I never had the chance to see Pantera live in person as I was a shit kid in the 90's growing up in a small fishing village in Northern Norway, with no possibility to go see them. Obviously it would have been amazing if Vinnie Paul and Dimebag were still alive, and they could have been reunited. But that dream was broken in 2004, and our hearts have been forever broken since that time. Seeing and hearing Pantera live has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, it was my favorite metal band growing up. I still have fond memories of blasting Vulgar Display of Power and The Great Southern Trendkill for the first time. Those records were so heavy, it made a lasting inpact on me. Heck I even loved Reinventing the Steel, and still consider it to be an underated record. Now Rex and Phil are back, with the best friends of the brothers and the band handling the drum and guitar duties. Zakk and Charlie are doing an amazing job, it sounds heavy, energetic and inspiring! Phil sounds fantastic; truly putting is heart and soul into every note, as well as Rex, who locks in perfectly with Charlie as the backbone of the rhythm section. This just brings me back into my boyhood room, back with my heroes playing on my tired cdplayer.

The music lives on and the dream of hearing this music live, lives on. This is truly for the fans OF THE MUSIC. That's why this is happening. I can't speak for Dime or Vinnie at all, as other people have been trying to do, and rather negatively through their channels stating ""they are turning in their graves!""...or ""Dime is ashamed"", and even calling it a fiasco. It's both disrespectful to the music, the legacy of Pantera; Phil, Rex, Zakk and Charlie, the Abbott-brothers and their families, who gave their blessings for this to happen. Haters;  If you absolutely need to hate, then go do it somewhere else, this isn't about you or your opinions. This is about the music of Pantera, true legacy. And we are blessed to finally hear it again in live format. And I would like to think, that this is what Vinnie and Dime always wanted."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"I was there in both gigs
Only thing I can say is that the guys did an amazing job
I did not expect Zakk and/or Charlie to play like the Abotts
Ola, I wish you could be there, so you can enjoy"
10,8vNeI_luGj0,I‚Äôm loving how they sound
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"So many comments on all the videos are ‚Äúshocked‚Äù at how good Benante is‚Ä¶. And I‚Äôm all WHAT??? Vinnie Paul LOVED Charlie! Charlie is a thrash metal god. Of all the big 4, he is the most accomplished and technically proficient drummer of the lot! It does make me happy that more people are getting into his playing. Now, go back, people, and see what i saw in Anthrax back in 1984‚Ä¶."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"They are all doing a helluva job. I‚Äôve seen pantera 9 times and I love this for the new generation. I was so excited to see drag the waters, really hope they add it or 10s from trendkill."
10,8vNeI_luGj0,"Dime‚Äôs solos have so much character & are so recognizable that we want to hear them note for note, but I think as long as Zakk gets close & throws elements or phrases of each solo into their live show that we‚Äôll be happy"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I fucking love that he shared this! People just don‚Äôt understand the mind of the artist man! And when one of us sends a message out like this‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like a group hug for lack of a better expression. We are of the same family from different walks of life. Thank your brother, this message lives in us all and it will until we go!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I'm with you, Barry. Years of ups and downs has taught me the same thing. It's all about balance. And learning that it is ok to walk away when I needed to was the biggest thing I ever did for my music. Like you said, it never goes away! Thank you for sharing."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I really needed to hear this, Barry. Thanks for posting this motivational message. After selling my studio twice and buying equipment again two times, I now realize no matter how frustrating being a creative person can be, music is my passion and I‚Äôm in it for life. It‚Äôs nice to know there are people out there who have  had similar experiences."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"This is the most emotional, uplifting, and inspirational message I've ever er heard you deliver.   Thank you for sharing this!!  This is much needed among many creators of music, including myself."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I learned this over time and just want to say thank you for articulating it so beautifully and honestly. This work matters.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Like you music is a part of me that will never go away.  In my younger days, I satisfied the itch by playing in bands which ultimately took it's toll on my family.  For me getting into recording and having a home studio was my way of balancing my music and my home life.  You give up the rush of performing live but there's nothing like putting a mix you've just finished in your car, giving it a critical listen, and realizing you've nailed it!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"As my older bro( who is a prolific musician and recording engineer) says "" Some days you get the bear and some days the bear gets you."" It's life. I have walked away from my home studio and drums for months and some moments I live in the studio. I think that is part of the creative mind. It is not static on inspiration. It comes and goes and I think sleep and time away makes folks more creative. Last time I checked most of us are not making a living doing this so no pressure. When it starts to be a job is when I will walk away for good."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Also - as I look at the comments - I‚Äôm seeing all these wonderful musicians, people that I‚Äôve never known, have the same feeling as me‚Ä¶you are connecting our hearts‚Ä¶that‚Äôs Big man! So dope!!! We needed that man!!!! Thank you so much"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I feel your pain, Barry. You got me a bit emotional watching you speak your truth. I have been at this for 30 years as a DJ and music producer. There are more layers than you can count. I have had success and continue to get it when I put that work in. My studio room didn't get my attention for about 4 years at one point. I was so turned off by a multitude of things. I still pay monthly for my huge vinyl collection even though I will probably never use them. Everything is digital.
You are 100% spot on. Sometimes you need that spark. I was so fed up and recently realized I needed to get out of my feelings and create shit I like. I only remix or work with th artists I personally am interested in. I can't fake it. So music is getting better and the mumble rappers are disappearing. Now is the time to put that work in. Respect, dude. Feel free to hit me anytime. Let's build a studio desk lol"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Love all your videos Barry.  This one is the most honest and relatable one you have done yet.  I can relate to absolutely all of this.  I share in your thoughts 100%.  Been down all the same paths it sounds like.  Creative people need to create.  Balance is good.  It is ok to take breaks, invest time in all of your interests, get some perspective.  When you find balance in your other interests we often come back to our music energized."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I feel this deeply. I really appreciate you for being on the level. My issue is having too many other things consuming my time and focus, but even while that is true, I still require breaks. Creating while feeling uninspired never works for the better, but making more music to fill the void is unfulfilling. I almost ""quit music"" 20 times this past season. Seems it can't happen because that's akin to quitting oneself. Love and peace XO"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I was recently in a slump for a while with my music and guitar playing. I have been playing guitar for 50+ years and have experienced this a number of times. But I aways come back to playing guitar. And the music is now fun and flowing again. Barry is right, once music and creativity are in you, it will never go away. Great episode!."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I love your content Barry.  I watch every single episode of Studio Talk and this message of hope is exactly what I and the world needs to hear right now.  Thank you for your wise words and the gift of hope that you provide for us all.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Fantastic video Barry! This really speaks to me as I do this professionally as my career and I completely relate to this. Thank you for sharing and being real. I'm sure you reached the masses with this one. Be well
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Breaks are healthy with any passion in life, when I walk away and come back to it I feel I am way more inspired to create again...at least with my own music. Creating with others can help carry me sometimes but only goes so far. We all probably started doing this music thing as a bit of fun which turned serious, just remember that"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"True say Barry, everything you said just chimes with feelings and emotions most, if not all of us have had at some point on our musical/hobby journies!  Great stuff, keep rockin'.  I'd like to wish you a lovely merry Christmas and a healthy, happy and successful 2023!  Merry Christmas and a healthy New Year to all!!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I had great opportunities in my late teens and early 20s in the music industry, and life took a different turn.  I have never lost the insatiable drive to write and I own lots of gear but basically have been in a 25+ year slump and I feel ya.  Don't take for granted what you HAVE accomplished as many of us are/were in your shoes and couldn't even pull off what you did :\"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thanks Barry. I have always felt that being a creative was both a gift and a curse, at the same time and in equal measure. The gift of being able to release stress and anxiety through music/art has incredible value and can be euphoric. On the flip side, the isolation one often feels can be crushing. The process really is an emotional pendulum. Thanks for opening up!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I feel the same as you Barry I love the creative process when it‚Äôs in you. You have to embrace it you keep on doing it if we have to wait 1 week or 1 month  for a video I‚Äôll be watching as I can say I‚Äôm not the greatest but I enjoy it
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I encourage anyone who feels like they have writers block to open their mind to the possibility that they are writing music from a place of habituation that has run its course. From my experience, most people pull from a set of characteristics that they are used to, and usually they are a mix of whatever their favorite bands do. Strumming patterns. Drum beats. Guitar or keyboard sounds. Secondly, they believe that any preplanning or preselecting or acknowledgement of musical elements is ""unnatural"" or ""not from the heart"". But those are illusions. I suggest to people who are stuck and have writers block the following tips.

1. Melody rhythm, NOT the pitches, are the soul of your melody. Work on your melody rhythms by realizing they can only occur at 3 possible points: before, on, or after beat one of your measure. Take your favorite 25 songs (that have been most widely loved by more than yourself) and list on paper where the melody rhythms start and stop. This will make placement of your melody rhythms a more conscious decision. Not relying on habit, and having to choose from the only 3 possible starting points, breaks writers block.

2. Create a list of words and phrases that stand out and have alot of impact when you hear them. Not words like ""distinguish"" or ""good"" etc. You want punchy evocative words like ""haunted"" or ""xerox"" or ""broken"". Go through all your favorite songs and movies. Make lists of every emotionally impactful phrase or word that you personally like. Refer to these lists when you are writing lyrics. Remember, verbs are the secret to strong lyrics. Just like melody rhythm is the soul of melody, verbs are the soul of your lyric. Using these emotional word lists break writers block.

3. Create low points. When you write a chord progression. Be aware of what constitutes a full close, a half close, or something continuing. These are called ""cadences"". Almost all new writers who finally figure out how to write a close or half close immediately off to the races using that trick over and over because it is the only trick they have, But the experienced writer knows to create low points so that the high points seem higher. So try looking at your favorite songs across all genres at where they place half closes and full closes and you will see that many great hooks and songs are a series of half closes followed by a full, or vice versa. Anything you write that you feel proud of, be it a lick, or a chord change, ask yourself how can i write a slightly less ""final"" sounding version of this, and place it appropriately so that you arent just leaning on that one trick you finally figured out. Dont just ""give"". Learn to withhold, then give. Creating variants of your riffs or melodies breaks writers block.

4. Understand melody speed vs harmony (the underlying chords) speed. Melody can only move at 3 speeds. Slower than the harmony, faster than the harmony, and at the same speed as the harmony. Listen to your favorite popular hit songs and determine where the melody moves faster than the chords behind it, and where it changes to one of the other options etc. You will find things like, the melody moves slower for the verse, then faster in the chorus etc. There is great power in alot of 80s hits in having the melody move in time with the harmony for just a moment or two. Becoming familiar with how your favorite songs use these tricks, and then applying them to your own works to breathe life into them breaks writers block.

There are many more of these tricks and techniques hidden in plain sight that nobody ever talks about or helps you figure out. But start with these few and your writing will improve beyond what you ever thought you could write. Force yourself to face these little challenges that at first seem like chores, and unnatural, and soon they become habit and you apply them without thinking, only feeling. People say ""I dont want to overthink music"" so I refuse tricks like this. But, you are already selecting these elements of your compositions by habit anyways. You are already choosing all these elements, just not with intent and familiarity. So get familiar. The sooner you get familiar, the less it will be a chore, and the more you will start to truly see how talented you really are."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thank you for sharing the intimate side of how we all feel inside about music, it's a hugely important driving force of what heals and keeps society at sane levels. We need the listeners feedback and enjoyment of our songs and they need us to entertain/heal the soul."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Barry - you are absolutely brilliant! You videos make me feel like I know you! I really appreciate how transparent you are - How real you are. That quality is on life support these days. This video made me cry (I‚Äôm a still a gangster thoü§£)-  all jokes aside, I can‚Äôt explain how much I needed to hear that. We as musicians have a rage of a desire that we don‚Äôt always understand - sometimes we even desire to cut it off. We have never fit into whatever the hell normal is. For you just to bring some comfort and understanding to this desire is the most inspirational thing I‚Äôve seen on the internet in years. I want you to know that your work is powerful and travelled to my heart way in North Carolina! I will continue to share your videos with friends and those who are like us. I‚Äôm am honored to be a true fan of yours! Thanks Barry‚ù§"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Thanks for this. So helpful and puts into a mutual perception what I have experienced many times. This and another recent video you did on hybrid setups helped me to find my lane in why I do this and see the balance of music production with the other parts of my life while spending my cash on just what I need at my present phase and not the next shiny thing that comes along. Also enjoyed and related to many of the comments this video generated.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Your channel is one of the best about music making and production because you're honest
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"It never goes away, like you said, even if you purge everything (done that too). It's a gift. For me, it's sounds, and guitar sounds, and it's endless search and you can't shut it off. It's who you are, core to your soul. But remember, it's a gift. Thanks for sharing."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I never sold my equipment (except to upgrade) or thought of giving up, but there were times in my life - because of my dedication to my kids - that I slowed down a lot with music.  My daughter was a competitive swimmer on a club team and my sun played basketball and traveled with his AAU team in high school during the summers so I spent lots of time (and money) working out with them and helping them get better and traveling to their meets/games.  I still dinked around with music during those times but my daughter has graduated from college (masters in Accounting - yes, I'm proud of her) and my son is a senior in college (majoring in Animation and business - also very proud of him).  I've had more time over the past few years to focus more on music (I need to record and produce more) - mostly guitar playing but a little writing and recording.  

I was really touched when my family went around the table for my birthday and they each listed things they love most about me (we do that for everyone's birthdays).  My daughter and son both said that they loved that I still work/practice the guitar and write music to ""keep the dream alive.""  They said it gives them hope and enjoyment.  My wife is also SUPER supportive of my love and expensive habit.  That validated everything for me - the support I give to them continuously as a father is being reciprocated (I never doubted it) and that it's ok to take some time for your self doing things you love (good, constructive things, that is)."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"May God bless you today
Because you are talking to me personally 
Today i‚Äôm going through that exact thing
I‚Äôve been producing music for 40 years 
I‚Äôve lost two marriages because this music 
And I still can‚Äôt seem to let it go 
I‚Äôve been high been low 
Just to hear that someone else knows how I feel
Makes me feel so much better
May God continue to bless you"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Wow. Thank you for this. I‚Äôm about your age, and I too have walked away from it all several times in my life, only to come crawling back because it is a part of who I am. This last time, I sold my studio and was away from it all for 5 years! I was burned out. But then a switch was flipped, and my love for it all flooded back in all at once. It was only then that I realized what you have, that I will be doing this until I am physically unable to continue. But you‚Äôre so right, life is all about balance, and so is our love for music. Thank you for your heartfelt perspective. üòé"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"A well timed video! Thanks for sharing this. Been on a creative slump for a while. Teaching guitar keeps me holding instruments, but every time I look at the studio, I go blank. Hoping for the muse to return soon (as I'm sure she will)."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Very well said, I have been through this very same thing, and it seems even more so today now that the reward factor seems to be missing. I can count my penny's (Insert Platform here) very quickly, so I still do it because of the very thing you speak of. The passion to reward ratio is not what it once was and that's too bad, but I will always come back to write another song as long as I am able but only when it is as you said, ""organic"", Thanks!!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Barry, this was great! Thank you for opening up to us. I know this is a message that will resonate with many, many people. A few more like this, & you could change your channel name to, ""Real Talk with Barry Johns."""
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Funny that he mentioned that he gave it all up a couple of times and then he rebought everything again. I went through the same thing over 7 years ago.. i got to the point I hated music, I hated the entertainment industry, and hated the artists I worked with. I was so fed up that I quit my audio engineering job, sold all my gear and guitars, and joined the Army. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, joining the Army was one of the best decisions I ever made. The last 1.5 years I fell in love again w music and I‚Äôve been building my home studio again. This time is my hobby and I love it, i‚Äôd never make this my job tho.
Best of luck to those who are grinding out there in the industry"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"100% relate as a writer/producer more than a player, though like you I play multiple instruments adequately. I tried walking away too - sold everything and ‚Äúretired‚Äù from music for three years, but it didn‚Äôt stick, and I ended up buying all the stuff again to make records with a new band. Once it‚Äôs in you, it‚Äôs in you. Take a pause when you need to, but don‚Äôt ever think you can escape. :)"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Great video Barry. It's never easy, but there is no joy like it!!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I really appreciate watching this video.   I have been watching your Studio talk videos the past month or so.   I walked away from music in 1995.   I tried adding it back in 1997 but dropped it again.  then tried again in 1999 and did the same,    10 years later, I tried it again and was actively for 5 years but then gave it up again.    It's now 7  years later my kids are grown up and not living at home anymore.  I have the time and space to be more active in music and I really enjoy it.  The music was always in me.   It's about the journey as you say ""learning is a part of the journey""."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Honesty! This is why this channel is my favorite. My gf of 7 year just left me. It has been very difficult because at the same time my grandfather (who taught me how to play guitar) is going through a tough medical situation with Sepsis. As a bargaining chip I told my gf.....""if i give up music completely will you stay?""  That didn't matter much to her either way. She was dead set on leaving. But at the time I was grasping at anything. Now watching your video, I realized, that I wouldn't have been able to hold up my end of the deal if she would have stayed."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Totally feel ya, I try not to force music, I will quickly go ""nope, not feeling it today"" and revisit it later."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"One of the most encouraging things I ever read many years ago was a magazine article, interview with Brian May of Queen. He said that there were many times when he would not pick up a guitar for 3-6 months because of this phenomenon you are talking about. I thought to myself, wow, I couldn‚Äôt imagine this guy going a day without playing. But how liberating it was to see someone of that magnitude being OK with walking away at times. I‚Äôm telling the story because that‚Äôs how much impact it had on me and that‚Äôs going back probably 25 years ago. Thank you, Barry, because even in this, it‚Äôs very inspiring and liberating. At the end of the day, musicians are more than just creators."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I enjoy playing music most of the time, and get tired of it others. I have the caveat of having a job in another industry, leaving music as more of a hobby for me. It is useful to have a job and a hobby to bounce back and forth to and from, because like you said sometimes the creativity for music ebbs and flows. I think if people find some other hobby to distract the brain from music, it will be easier to start fresh when they get back into your studio. Likewise I enjoy my job, but sometimes it wears on me and I go to my hobbies to distract myself until I feel more motivated for creativity concerning my job. The hobbies I choose have no business element to them, as that adds the stress of timelines and demand I have in other parts of my life."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I got scared when I saw the title of this video. I love that sense of flying when writing a song. It feels like so much is possible. It‚Äôs so hard to give that up. But yes I walk away when it‚Äôs too much.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I've been saving up a recording setup for at least 8 years now. Bought one drum at a time. One microphone at a time.  Zzounds was my best friend, got an analog synth, and, how I found your channel, an Apollo x8p, bot took me a year to pay off each. A ll of it is studio grade premium equipment. I've never heard any of it. Most of it just collects dust.

Thunderbolt 3 was insanely expensive when I got the Apollo, never could get financing. And now it's yesteryear's tech. And magically right when I finally had things going right, I got hit with some gnarly rootkit/ virus/hacker something or rather, killed 2 macs and 3 PCs. Trying to save my kid's baby pictures from corruption, recovering fragments that reinfect whatever I put them on. All of them had an issue, in one form or another, all the way down to the root.  

Not unlike a lot of us creative types.  The curse of needing to create, the blessing of a passion understood by few. I've gone from only knowing how to run Ableton to being totally comfortable in terminal on Linux/Mac and Windows. In the 20 years I've been a musician,  only ever been part of 3 good songs, but that i have thousands of masterpieces. Quick snapshot first day of school, absolute gold. The look in his eyes  first time hearing a synth, Platinum. What's another work season's worth of dust? For $3000+, you cannot find a better monitor controller than the Apollo. 

Anywho , I've been the feel of this video for 3 years now. I appreciate your work, this just hit home a little more"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thanks for sharing dear barry
I‚Äôm Iranian and I understand this situation and pressure better than anyone! üòî
For freedom & music‚Ä¶ ‚úä"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Barry, we have so much in common, I have a big woodwork shop, at my house, This is my third Studio, selling everything twice already, and then spent thousands to buy the same again. I feel the same way you do. Just take a break, but don't sell anything,  take your time and build a big console desk for yourself, and take your time, after a month or two, you will feel ok again. I think you are burned out.  Hope you feel better soon."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Motivational speech for anything in life.  I am learning a skill outside of music that makes me want to give up.  And did.  Many times.  I keep plugging away.  Eventually, I will achieve that goal. 

Taking a break is fine, but always come back.  If it has been a while, listen to the songs that get you excited about music. Clean the rust and grease the wheels.

Thank you for the wisdom, Barry!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"We all need breaks from the things we love for a while. We need breathing room and space to recover. It‚Äôs alright if you run into a dry spell creatively speaking. Just do your thing, sir. I thank you for all that you do. Take care of yourself. We‚Äôll be here. In the meantime, keep on keeping on."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Me and my wife were just arguing 30 minutes ago And I get on my phone and see this. Music has always been core of my soul and as much as sometimes it hinders my finances I don‚Äôt know how to drop my craft and MoveOn. All I tell myself. Yes, I work too hard and games so much to just let it all go. It‚Äôs difficult sometimes, it‚Äôs frustrating sometimes, and it‚Äôs very draining. But I can‚Äôt stop. thanks for sharing."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Awesome video Barry. So true.  I find myself buying all the gear    It‚Äôs never good enough for me I want more gear. Never content.  And I don‚Äôt have any music to show for.   I‚Äôve found that mastering covers seems to teach me how to really write music.  Merry Christmas to u and your family.  I hope I are super blessed this season and 2023 is going to be incredible
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Love you Barry! Thanks for always keeping it real!
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Great video. I am just struggling with negative thoughts actually and I was just thinking should I just give up ? So your video came in the proper time. F it .. our gift is too precious to walk away. Thank you
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thank you very much for this message.

I found your channel days ago, while on the search for outboard gear topics and semi pro interfaces and got hooked with your videos and mindset!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Thanks for being a sensitive man and express how I feel as a woman artist
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Barry thank you for sharing. You could have spent more time on the curse of music but I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt. It has also been a blessing. For most of us we married music for life. Until death do us part. For richer and mostly poorer. It‚Äôs been an interesting journey.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Too funny, Barry. Because I too also have a wood shop. I wonder how many of us music writers/players/recorders also share in this hobby. When I am in a dry spell, I shift over to wood working and expend my energy there. Then, over time, I will hear some songs that trigger me to want to create again. Glad to see you are sticking to it! Enjoy the talent God has given to you! Cheers!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Barry you re a bro to all the community (i don t think I m overstating). We all so relate and learn from you experience!  I m sending you my next mixes in a few weeks (i m moving into a new place) please I 100% wanna work with you ! How do we send you work?
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I‚Äôve made the same mistake numerous times. Huge regret everything time I did it. My biggest regret now is having let go of a lot of early 80‚Äôs gear that now goes for insane money and is damn near impossible to buy now üò¢
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I'm 71 now. I gave up on Music some few times. I must confess those were the very worst periods in my life. Thanks those days are gone.  I gave up my 'sanity' in order to be happy and follow what I really was supposed to do in life: Music!
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,This takes courage! Thank you Barry.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Right time for the right words. At least for me. Thank you Barry! üëç
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,It‚Äôs better give up now and start a new career before AI will disrupt the whole music production business. AI will never run out of Inspiration and flow
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thumbs up for this! I have paused maybe three or four times, but have always come back. Once a musician, ever a musician."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Man. I just went through this. It hurts when it‚Äôs bad but came back after 3 months of ‚Äúretirement‚Äù.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Just superb. Every word I relate too. Thank you.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Great truth. We all go through it. No matter what level one is at. Once the music big hits you, you‚Äôre screwed! Haha.."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I feel ya. Life responsibilities make it very very hard.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Barry, Barry, Barry,
That was beautifully heart felt.
I'm sure many of us can relate.

I could not help but think of the recent Howard Stern Interview With Bruce Springsteen.
#1 Bruce really opened up to give us a peek at the man behind the curtain.
#2 He decscibed how his song writing passion ebs and flows, has'nt writen a new song in six years.

My own experience is, that my original songs are inspired by human experiences and observations that stir my emotions. With no emotions, there are no new songs.

I've discovered that obsessing over gear is a creativity killer.
As much as I enjoy your gear discussions, I'm much more productive when I turn it all off and let the music within me flow.

Best to ya,
Take care"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thanks for sharing the heartfelt, inspiring message. Where can we find your music? Would love to check it out! Best."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Funny we should be friends! 
A wood shop,a studio love,hate for music! More love than hate for sure!
Creation is the highest honor to behold and must not be taken lightly. If you do not make it a priority in your life no one else will!
I have gone months without going in the studio. Why do I have all this equipment when I don‚Äôt use it? Time to sell it all? Then something happens a tickle of creation riffs,melodies and I‚Äôm right back in it like a rocket to the moon! So, happy I didn‚Äôt sell it all! It‚Äôs an honor to be able to write songs that start with a riff and end up being an opus at the end! The journey of completion always amazes me. We immortal ourselves when we create songs and wood works from ideas and emotions. We are very dynamic creatures embrace your ups and downs and create a balance between them! Word up! Take care!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Thanks Barry, I relate to your message 100%"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"At 65 & getting started after 3-4 years rehabilitating myself learning Music Theory & Guitar from Mech Engineering after stroke in 2016 MUSIC sounds totally New to me. the passion for me to KNOW this is my Pursuit. I do NOT know any Previous RULES and coming at it MY WAY.  If it winds up Poop, it is on me but I tried.  Barry I have followed you for 3+ years. Keep the Faith Bro. You Get Christmas & New Years & LOVE. The Best Buddy."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Facts Barry! And thanks for your advice and wisdom sir!
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I very strictly use those valleys for learning. There‚Äôs always something new to discover.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,TRUE THAT.....I went through this emotional time as well. Thanks mate
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,FANTASTIC!! thanks for the that. i can relate on ALL levels. PEACE BROTHER.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,You really should have filmed this laying on your back on a leather couch. But I understand and can relate to what you're saying. Creativity comes in many forms and many creative people do drift from activity to activity. I also had a wood shop. I built it with a couple of friends. It came off the back of the detached garage and was about 12x28. I lost it some years back when I sold off a portion of my land. These days photography and learning new methods of cooking are the two things that steal the most time from music. There's nothing wrong with having many interests and creative outlets. I think that's what will keep us sane later.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"iam with you.  I started with music when I was 4 years old.  also started photography doing wildlife stuff.  want to start writing for backround music in wildlife videos now that I am retiering. speaking of 55 years involved with musi,  also recording,  but dont feel like doing music I can not relate to.  Phrases just repeating repeating going nowhere slowly.ü§£"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Superb video, pure wisdom, great talking, sir!"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Respect, there are periods when we just should let go and enjoy the ride, not punish ourselves for no reason, let it flow."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I suck at music, and love playing and making it anyways. Cause it‚Äôs mine and makes me happy."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"You‚Äôre probably better than ‚ÄúOK‚Äù but I you hut this one out of the park! 

I‚Äôd rather put of one great film than 100 small ones too but that one great film might be in that 100 and if I wait to make that ONE, I may miss the opportunity all together‚Ä¶"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Theres a book I read many years ago called The Artists Way by Julie Cameron..   that helps to unblock creative energy
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"That's the good thing about Home Studio, you can just close the door, go live life and come back without the bills, I sometimes will be in the same place. I a 52 yr old father of 7, 4 grands, my youngest is 4, yes 4, I got hurt at work in '09, Started full time Dj and Learning production in 2010, all genres, it's always something elsefor me if the creativity isn't bumpin.bumping.. Plus I'm a learner, May I suggest maybe having someone else  vid editing,  jus like music, workflow can be king.. Get some medical, jus for the creativity of course,  lol.. Also just good old silence is another way, Blessings to you and yours.."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I dont feel like making music because there is to much pressure to make money from it. Also I live in a block of apartments where the nabors are a significant problem with noise.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Right there with you, Barry."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,respect. so much truth in it.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I needed to hear this! Thank you
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Life is a war between those who are being creative vs those who are being destructive.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,This vid is one of your best. Thank you.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,I guess I'm the opposite only because I wish I could spend all my time on music.....I wish I had the free time I had when I was in my teens and twenties before I got married. Maybe when I retire.....but I doubt it.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"i take breaks, play video games and or use my equipment to make money being creative for others like i love pro audio but i just made a few videos and photoshoot for some clients that got me back into the programs which is way better then taking a break - the youtube thing is very hard work b it really dose not pay easily"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Needed this Barry thank you
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,Thank you for posting this Barry.
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Happy Holidays, Barry. I hope your day gets better."
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"Indeed sir, now are you going to just give away your gear for free to those who have not yet come to your enlightened understanding of futility? I'd like the Christmas lights and the compressor please. Respectfully yours, this guy"
10,ChwjCUwbWhE,"I‚Äôm 51. Kids grown and moved onto their own lives. I see a Christmas tree behind you, so you likely already turned off your ME ME ME side and forgot about that. It‚Äôs all about your presence in other people‚Äôs lives. Sometimes the best [gift] you can give for Christmas is that meaningful moment where you say I Love You. People don‚Äôt forget those.

Wishing you the best Holiday season, where we Give to Receive. ‚ù§"

10,96c3BTcnt9U,"BECAUSE THEYRE ALL FUCKING NICE!!!! I was born in 90, but grew up listening to the LOX, and still to this day Jada & SP are in my top 2, and X would have to be in the top 5 as well. 

Murder Mommy is still one of my fav tracks SP has ever done, too. They all just spit REAL game in their music. Consignment is another album that has values and morals to live by,  too. Now, Millyz has finally made it maintream-ish he will be up there with the LOX, for sure."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I swear this episode is what the ppl needed styles such an lyrical hip hop og we appreciate y‚Äôall fir this one
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Sounds like nothing but loyalty between everybody from Yonkers!! That‚Äôs the way it should be done üëçüèæ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I'm absolutely lovin dis interview... Ghost ain't lying either YO is different af much respect for showing me love every time I came thru!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Shoutout to YO for having so many legends, including the ones in my family. 914 Love"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"I lived in YO for a short period in 2011 when I was 18. I lived on a 2nd floor apartment of a busy road (palisade) right around the corner from Schlobohm projects. I used to have to get through a gate to get upstairs and everyday there would be about 10 to 30 dudes standing in the front but they never attempted to ""press"" me. I boxed out there at the ymca and met alot of solid individuals. I remember not having a AC in the summer and it was so hot I used to go walk by the hudson river next to the metro north üòÖ.  I mean those were some rough days but it made me more solid üí™. It felt like dudes out there ran the blocks. Another place I can really compare it to as far as size and similarities is Newburgh. NY got alot of small cities/towns under the radar that's solid. I grew up in the Binghamton area. Not as tough but definitely had its moments."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"More than a podcast, it's a show. Congratulations üéâ  the culture needs this !!!"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Am I able as a man from Maryland, to say I love the LOX. They embody the principles I utmost respect as a man. Much respect!!!!!"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"What DMX & The LOX did for Yonkers, New York in a mainstream hip hop landscape is impeccable! They boosted the self-esteem of an entire city that was considered a black cloud. Every borough, section or city in New York except for Yonkers would get a shout out on TV & radio before 1997. DMX & The LOX changed that and then some. R.I.P. DMX! üôèüèª"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Styles is nice tho! I like the LOX! His story about coming up in the hood brings back memories of me growing up in the projects. People can talk about how bad the hood or projects was or is. It was home and a place where you got your nickname from, where you got your toughness from, where you got to know everybody and everybody got to know you. Yeah! It was rough growing up but it was fun too and I miss it. Styles story brought back some good memories! I remember playing football in the snow at night time, riding my bike around everywhere and ringing doorbells and taking off running, climbing on the roof, playing basketball till it got late at night. It was fun! We had fun! It was the 80's though! You can't do that now!  LOL!"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Every now and then Math, I am so into the interviews, that when it's over and I hear that gunshot, I jump....LMAO"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Man i cant wait for the full episode to drop ! Ive rewatched these clips multiple times ! Ghost always a vibe and energy crazy! üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,It would have been so damn fire to see Math sitting across from DMX interviewing himüíØüíØ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Styles is the type guest that you really don‚Äôt have to talk much. Just ask the right questions and the show is üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,every time i here styles in an interview i jus respect him n the lox more n more. i cant think of one other group thats grew up together n respect each other like these guys do. every other group has some kind of beef or falling out but these guys are really like brothas n i fucking love it üôåüèø
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"When they first started out in 97, I thought sheek was the best. Then as he became solo jada became the best . 

But now in 2022 I think Styles P surpassed them. I Think he‚Äôs the best lyrically in the lox"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Math Salute Good Brotha,You definitely have one of the best shows on the internet that covers great content,Peace and Blessings King #SaluteTheReal #KeepFlyingHigh From The Brickz 2 Brooklyn ‚úäüèøüòé‚úäüèø"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Ella Frizgreard is from Yonkers also. I  was impressed.  I  saw the Lox on the Bad Boy Tour in 97
10,96c3BTcnt9U,The L.O.X paid their dues to become the legendary they are today  .
10,96c3BTcnt9U,When Styles describes Yonkers it sounds like he's describing Buffalo. We rock too! 716üíØ‚úäüèøüíØ‚úäüèøüíØ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Mary J Blige and Redman need to be on here next üíØ make it happen Math ‚úäüèæ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,The best episodes to date. Styles P that legend üî•üî•üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Mecca really struggling to understand that alotta friendships don't start at a CERTAIN FIXED POINT. I couldn't tell you the exact point when most of my closest friends BECAME my friends. All I know is that they BEEN friends from EARLY!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"I'm from Queens, my grandmother lived in Westchester, stayed with them for a minute, worked in a few places in Yonkers"

10,96c3BTcnt9U,Cypress Hill & LOX the most solid groups to do it never a public issue always love & respect for each other never jealous always cheering & wanting each to do great
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Greatest & Realest Trio! This is one of my favorite interviews!!! üî•üî•üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I‚Äôm dying for y‚Äôall to drop this whole thing!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,LOX are Legends period
10,96c3BTcnt9U,True era of HipHop
10,96c3BTcnt9U,LITERALLY DA ONLY STORIES IN DA GAME I LIVE FORüò≠üíØ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,That LOX joint ‚ÄòIn Too Deep‚Äô on Deathrow Records is a classic!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"""Genuine"" is authentic,  so its easy for ppl like that to create lasting long term memories.  LOYALTY AND LOVE,  they been gave us the ""bluprint"""
10,96c3BTcnt9U,That Ruff Ryders movement was definitely different. R.i.p to the Dog X
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Styles said ""Cause Puerto Ricans are black"" and as a half black half Rican who ACTUALLY KNOWS his history I'm glad someone else knows the truth üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I‚Äôm looking at Math as he‚Äôs listening to P and Math is straight up dialed in.
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"From the outside looking in, Yonkers has a distinctive yet familiar feel. Lox,Mary J and Dmx reflect that very well."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"True story...As a North Philly dude...I drove this young lady to NY to see her family. This is before GPS...I'm lost in Yonkers.. Styles and them on the block running in and out the laundromat hustling hard... Shout out to them dudes I saw them in action, mid 90s...Real ones salute!"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Now I'm about to go watch that classic Hoffa/Shine battle for the  umteenth time. Classic bangerüî•üî•üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Why Graph sitting there with a cup and blinking every second üòÇYes man in full effect - 'Facts, that's real shit, right right' these are the limitations of this mans vocabulary."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Now this is an interview respect üôè I'm 36 from Louisiana and the lox dmx and of course Mary always been mad respected rip dmx üôèüïä
10,96c3BTcnt9U,One of the few interviews I pray is about 3 hours plus
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Listening real hard like I wasn‚Äôt a EARTHLING!!!!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,As a fellow Yonkers nigga. This made me proud af üíØüíØüíØ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs was a different world, can never be duplicated."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I love how Styles P mentioned reading .. ü§ûüèΩüí™üèæüß†‚ù§
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Kiss originally lived on Pier St. as a kid, he‚Äôs from the South Side too."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"It‚Äôs a way tighter knit when you go hungry alongside your brother,
Or your life depends on the loyalty of your brother.
The knit is not so tight when you‚Äôre amongst the party people,
And those who love going to comedy shows,
Because in parties and comedy everyone is running away from the ugliness of life,
Everyone has a mask on,
And they probably don‚Äôt want to take that mask off neither.
So when sh$t gets real,
The clowns scatter.
Sometimes we want to have fun,
But it‚Äôs probably best we stick with those from the trenches,
Because those are the ones that will hold you down.
The worst thing in life is to have good times with people who were always cowards.
Life is long, 
And life has its ups and downs,
Party people and clowns always hide from the ugliness of life,
So they‚Äôll hide from you,
If you‚Äôre looking ugly or remind them of the ugliness within themselves"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Think of every group/collective ever‚Ä¶ Lox never split up , we never heard of any issues they had with each other, and we all know. Dithers beef so of course they had differences but we never heard about it"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,This the first interview I watched all the clips styles p sensational and that man
10,96c3BTcnt9U,If they don‚Äôt ask about Kasino they don‚Äôt really go back w/ the LOX like that. I‚Äôm listening & I hope he comes up.
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Growing up in Brooklyn, I had a friend who would go to Yonkers every week and I would be like, why are you going to Yonkers?Lol.At that time, I thought Yonkers was all white ppl.He told me , nah,  it is wild asf up there and they do not like Brooklyn nikkas.lol.When the L.O.X. came out, I was like, oh shit, my boy was not lying.Shout out to the L.O.X."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Big ups & much Love to Ravine, Warburton, School St, Locust Ave, School 12, Whitney Young, Riverdale, Getty Square, Gorton HS & Yonkers HS rip Earl YONKERS, Mt Vernon & New Roüî•üî•üî•"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Stylez P always had his own style..certain dudes  cant be duplicated him being one , but many replicas will always  follow"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Styles P a legend üíØ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"I don't think people know DMX was a legend legend in Yonkers years and years before he blew up. He was battling other rappers at house parties, clubs, in prison etc...was one of the first ever guest on Stretch and Bobbitto with Percee Pee back in 1991. Unsigned Hype back in 91 Source Magazine. X had like a 15 year run in the underground NY circuit before ""It's Dark"" even dropped. He was well respected."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,After Tony yayo this has to be the best interview
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Yo Math you been consistent AF!!! Keep ya foot on they neck
10,96c3BTcnt9U,My favorite rapper love the ghost him n biggie will always be my favorite mcs
10,96c3BTcnt9U,LEGENDARY STYLE
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"The lox been here since here I was 14 they held the city down. Ushered in a new era of rap with mase what they did on them clue tapes, cant be duplicated."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Great week on the pods. STYLES P. KG on knuckleheads üî•
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Run DMC, De La Soul, Outkast, The LOX...there're very few major rap groups who've never publicly had internal beef. Salute."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Damn styles p got hella of backstory! They put on for the city
10,96c3BTcnt9U,LOX is definitely legendary period
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Nas is my favorite hip hop artist but Styles is probably my favorite one to hear talk. Him and Pac are just the realest.
10,96c3BTcnt9U,He not lying about how they live. You can drive by Yonkers and see him sitting out there every other day. It‚Äôs just a humble thing
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Lox, X and Mary need a bio pic, word!!!"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Math has TAKEN OVER!!!!!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,This might be your best guest bro
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Math we know it's your show but let guys ask what they want to ask smh different prospective
10,96c3BTcnt9U,I swear it seems like everyone from the nineties came up the same no matter where you from especially if üòÄyou were heavily involved in the hip-hop scene
10,96c3BTcnt9U,They need a docuseries like the Wu..that would make a nice spinoff
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Damn math you  to controlling   let it flow  sometimes
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Shout out to the lox I a! Huge fan of ya I been listening to ya since I was young I a!m  35 years old  real talk
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Raw Rome was so damn nice. I‚Äôm glad SP showed him love #914
10,96c3BTcnt9U,There is a great HBO mini series called Show me a Hero that‚Äôs tells a crazy Yonkers story
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Now y'all gotta get kiss and sheek on this joint ASAP!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,The way graft looking at that cup that styles flinging around is hilarious..... I wouldve been got him yo put that cup down lol
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Come on man. How are you not filling up the OG‚Äôs cup. Pay attention to the guests beverage pleaseüòÇ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,The next Lox album should be named 3 The Hard Way!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Big 914 in the building! Shoutout to Yonkers
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Blessings to be here still üôèüèø
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Biggie my favorite rapper of all time‚Ä¶but Styles is my favorite rapper closest to B.I.G. I think big would‚Äôve had to keep his sword sharp fuccin wit him cuz his bars ain‚Äôt repetitive it‚Äôs always some new grimey punchline shit‚Ä¶over any beat at that
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Living in Yonkers we just move different .....
10,96c3BTcnt9U,We need banks and fab up in here
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Would‚Äôve been nice if lox and jhood would‚Äôve kept cooking up
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Ummm here in Queens LL. Nas and everyone from Queens Bridge. 50 and G unit.G Rap, Bronson, Onyx and many others every boro can say the same thing. This is New York we are the Mecc of Hip Hop especially in the 80's and 90's and people still respected that half these new kids 35 and under don't recognize they seem to think the south started hip hop or LA lol"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Man I love these clips!
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Your favorite rapper loves to read
This is the greatest show ever"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Show is super dope,  if you could consider changing the outro music it would improve my viewing experience... Doesn't feel like it represents the brand smoothly and audibly it is such a shock to the system I'm jumping up at the end of videos to cut it off.

Could just be my own non expert opinion, but outside of this minor critique, the whole format is on point and the ""interview"" style is fluid, moves very authentically how Math doesn't need to guide the whole conversation and the respect afforded to individuals when speaking... (Plus the rooms unquestionable respect for the host)

""HEY GROWTH... WE GOT ANOTHER 1!!!!""

Great work king 
üôè"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"I think when Mary J first came out, she claimed the BX"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the LOX, three niggas that listen and watch‚Äù  can‚Äôt think of a more cohesive rap group to this day.  Not one publicized internal issue ever."
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"Pretty sure dblock is the only group in hip hop history that had zero dirt....ran up on or hurt zero times....had rumors on them zero times etc etc...


Solid, GOATS"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,If you love the money then prepare to die for it üò§
10,96c3BTcnt9U,"People like what Styles gotta say, Look at the view numbers on the clips"
10,96c3BTcnt9U,This gonna be a great oneüíØüî•ü¶æ
10,96c3BTcnt9U,Bigga been quiet damn near the entire interview.... he don't like Styles or something?
10,96c3BTcnt9U,TOP 3‚Ä¶hands DOWN üí®üî•üíØü•∑üèøüí°
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Is there anything better than unboxing a brand new guitar?  üé∏üé∏üé∏
Double exciting when its a brand new model!
Guitar link - https://imp.i114863.net/OR2yzG
Enjoy :)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Beautiful instruments,  Darrell looks like he got his Christmas gifts early."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I'm a big fan of the ornate headstocks they usually have. But i can appreciate these simpler versions too. Just wish they would offer one in a natural finish
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,This guy must have reviewed hundreds of guitars.  It is amazing he can exude the amount of enthusiasm that he does.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,D'Angelico is definitely a contender in the guitar world. Thanks Darrell.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,This is a big improvement in the headstock design.  I always hated their headstocks before.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Their higher level semi hollows use a JB/Jazz combo, so it's not surprising that they're using a similar approach here.  Having a hotter bridge pickup in a semi hollow seems odd, but I think it's great.  The cleans don't have that upper midrange nasal sound as a PAF and have a more balanced sound.  Plus it makes for a great middle position sound too."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Seems like great instruments. I wish they had a left-handed version as well
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"The 30's cupcake radio knobs are a nice touch. Extra attention to detail. Supro bought the company and invested some money into to make it both affordable but still give it a premium vibe. The PU's have a DeArmand vibe. Both chunky with really nice spank, :-)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Nice line of guitars by a very reputable company. I like the no-frills approach they used.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Your enthusiasm and the efforts you put in all your reviews is both very useful and a joy to watch. Thank you, sir."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I like the vibes of these guitars. Especially that wine red mini!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"As always it's a great review.  I have been a D'angelico fan for years.  I loved that they stood out above the crowd of ""also ran"" guitars.  Now it looks like the new owners are going on the cheap with the f hole style, head stock and tuners.  Welcome to the growing herd of ""also ran"" guitars.  The gig bags looked like they were pretty good  and the packaging was above par from what I could see."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Love the Ebony, gorgeous and the diamonds!
It chugs!!!!
Sounds great like the thick tones when the gain kicks in!
Clean sounds great as well!
Love the black!
Very Lucille!
Interesting blue and the red looks really good as well!
Thanks Darrell!"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I like it that they have all the playability, sound, and quality but ease back on the ornate nature. I like the look of these better than their higher-end guitars. Well done."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Have not seen a D'Angelico locally since I was a teenager. They weren't cheap, and they were decent then. (Edit) I wonder what tone pots they used? The attack is hot. I like it. Simple design, elegant, pretty, and functional. Sounds great. Out of my price range, though. These guitars are likely examples of the ""law of diminishing return."""
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"gotta say, ALL these tones are phenomenal! very impressed :)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Those are the prettiest D‚ÄôAngelicos I‚Äôve ever seen.  Not the blue one, that Rambler blue color‚Äôs hideous, but the red and black are gorgeous.  Much more appealing to me than their standard tuners and headstock.  Now if they‚Äôd only offer the Bob Weir Bedford in that red.  Or that black.  And maybe finish the neck in a thin satin natural rather than gloss paint."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Love how Darrell mixes styles so we all can get an idea for different styles
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Great review. Does the mini sound any different due to smaller size compared to its big brother? Might be another good comparison!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I‚Äôm not surprised by these fine instruments, a great guitar maker making great guitars."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,They are all very nice... the blue is great - and that headstock is very cool.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I have an Artist Guitar TC-59 with Bullbuckers. They sound amazing. The TC-59 has coil splitting though. Ash body as well. Paid $199 for it. Insane.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Listened to this on my cell phone, and this still sounds amazing!!!  Why, oh why are you making me want to buy one of these?"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I mainly play superstrat/supertele/RG style guitars but for my next I want a semi hollow and will probably go with a d'angelico when I can afford it. They are so cool, but my main issue with all semihollows is that I hate glossy necks."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Great sounding guitar, much prefer simple electronics with just the one tone & volume control, all my guitars are the same in that respect"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I would love to see some of the prog guitar world on this channel. Music Man Majesty, Jason Richardson cutlass, Abasi, Strandberg, Aristides (just to name a few)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,You don't have them in this video but I think their Deluxe Bedford models are cool looking. The Bedford shape is like their offset guitars.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Hooray.  I have never liked the huge, heavyweight headstock and this is terrific looking.  (You used the nicer word - the 'ornate' headstock was always a put-off for me.)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Wonderful and classy guitar. Dig the details: the diamond dots and the long ""f"" holes, like the Fender Coronado..."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I like this headstock much more than the more elaborate ones which are over the top.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I like the headstock much better on the new one's, I never cared for the goofy cuts on the others"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Glad to see simple controls for a change. I am not a fan of coil splits because they produce really crappy sounds from my experience
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Yep,  D'Angelico headstocks and tuning knob shapes have turned me away from them.  But, where are this series made?  Matters to some of us."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Very nice indeed. I have a D'Angelico Premier Riverside acoustic that was a great bang for the buck!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Those are very discreet looking for D'Angelico. I like it. Maybe the mini should have had the f-holes made mini as well. Other than that they're great.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Nice looking guitars. I really like the simplified headstock but not crazy about the F-hole design.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I had an excel ss some years ago. great guitar but was to top-heavy. these headstocks seem to be a little bit smaller. Are these models top-heavy as the original ones?
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Darrell, how did they manage to get an ""open book"" headstock on these guitars? Is that not a Gibson thing and don't they sue people for this usually? Just curious"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"The way it comes across on camera is almost like the cauliflower blue you used to find in the big box of crayola crayons. It may still be there but I'm 46, I haven't bought crayons in decades"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I'm happy to see they changed the headstock. I never liked the old one.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,The red Tour Excel looks great. I have a D'Angelico Premier in white I like a lot. Plays good; just so nice.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Beautiful guitars.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Absolutely LOVE D‚ÄôAngelico‚Äôs!!! (SS & 59) Looking at an EXL-1 as wellüëçüèº
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Must be nice, I am a lefty, finding new and interesting guitar is like pulling teeth. Firefly has quit making any lefties so that is out...."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Dc and Dc mini look a bit like ES 335 compared to ES 339. I can speak from experience that the ES 339 is nice for people who want the semi hollow body experience, but don't want to deal with as large a body. I'm only 5 ft 7. I kinda prefer more compact guitars, especially with electrics, which tend to be heavier than acoustics, and thus more unwieldy when big."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I love my D'angelico EXL1 .. just an amazing guitar
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"very cool guitar! speaking of semi-hollow bodies... I got one recently, but the inside of the f hole was really dirty. Do you know of a good way to clean it? like any products to use or techniques? I would greatly appreciate any help :)"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,What I do like and would like to see more of is one volume and one tone control.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Looks like a Kershaw assisted open knife. I like those too!!
No bass guitars? üòÆ
Seriously though, nice stuff. Thanks!!"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"How would you compare the quality vs a PRS SE, being that they are in the same price range?"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Have a D‚ÄôAngelico Excel Mini DC made in Korea.  It‚Äôs a fine guitar, well made, playability and tone are fine.  For some reason, I pick up my Epiphone Lucille much more often.  Is it the aura or the guitar itself?  Why would I pick a D‚ÄôAngelico before a Fender Tele or Strat or Gibson Les Paul, PRS Starla or Santana.  How about a video on why your followers play the guitars they play?"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"The EXL1 Excel I had was pretty nice
First impressions of this featured model is it looks ‚Äúvery price friendly ‚Äú
I dont wanna say cheap but‚Ä¶. Indonesian goodness???? 
Damn kids save up for something you wont sell for half on Craigslist later in the year"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"I have a couple  of D'Angelicos (Premier DC and Excel SS). Very interesting, the new series (and beautiful shirt, by the way)."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Definitely prefer the understated D'Angelico Tour series to their overly ornate (IMHO) other models. That Slate Blue is gorgeous! Maybe a Tour DC Mini might be worth checking out when it hits Canada stores. Now if I could try before buy, but probably not."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Lindas Guitarras!!!!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Finally, a D‚ÄôAngelico headstock I like."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,They're  $1400!! That's still too  much for my wallet.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Great video, a few nice touches but for $1400 clams that‚Äôs quite a tag."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I have an old 2015 SS Excel (I guess that is old now) with the Kent Armstrong pickups. Love it. Did the Excel series go away for a while? I think they were the middle line when this one was new also.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Oh yeah! I'll grab the smaller one with the nut powder blue! 
There's something else I gotta have; the sweet looking shirt you have!!! Must feel terrific in the winter.
Thanks!!"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I am an old timer who grow in an era when the name D'Angelico meant the very pinnacle of guitar craftsmanship and quality. It saddens me to see what that great name has become.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Quality looks very good.  I don't think I could live with those 'f' holes though!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,They are stunning .wow and hot wired great guitars
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I have a bedford i got real cheep on sale. I love the neck carve and the generic pickups sound good. Really the only thing is the trim sucks n it neede intonation
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Is the Mini the same size and scale as the ES-339? Thanks Darrel.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,New headstocks are a big improvement
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Nice looking guitars. Where are these made?
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Darrell on a different subject, what do you think is the best all solid acoustic electric for the money?"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Looks like the headstock is similar to the Sire Larry Carlton LP and 335 models
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"D'Angelico: ""I guess since Epiphone isn't using their old headstock design..."". 
Jokes aside, I have a nice D'Angelico hollow body and it is a wonderful guitar. 
Thanks for the content Darrell!"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Kind of bummed they used the same size F holes on the Mini as the full sized. They look out of place. Neck dive on the Mini?
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,So what do the guitars typically cost.? A lot of fellows cannot afford that brand of guitar if it is over $1500 ...
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Do you think the headstock will last long with Gibson?
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,well done Darrell.  Send it on over lol.  very nice stuff
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I've been waiting for diamonds. I'm feeling the SS. The Supro's are pretty.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"The fingerboards seem really glossy, which you didn't mention. Not an issue at all, just a little unusual and different."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Open book 3/3 headstock shape... That will surely get some attention.  Is it just me or is the bridge PU height set really high up to the strings?
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Very Cool, Thankyou. Stunning looking and sounding Guitars."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Excellent pickups !!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Those are some pretty guitars‚Ä¶. I likey!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Who owns and makes these new D'Angelico and do they still make arch tops? üòéüëçüá®üá¶
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Good god they are $1500 , they look about half that price."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"not worth $1500!  It's firefly for me  :)
NICE Review BTW!!!"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I have 7 D‚ÄôAngelico guitars now. I see a satin blue mini dc in my future üòä
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,To me they just screamed look out Gibson.  But what do I know ü§î.  But yeah they will definitely help deangelico get over that to pretty to rock thing. Those pickups sounded great to me deangelico in general or at least until know always sounded jazzy and higher frequencies
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Number Three Saddle is WAY BACK on both the Black one and the Wine one! Wonder why, Maybe because of the angle it's at???"
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Nice but at $1500 there are others I buy first.
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"So this is basically there idea of the  PRS ""S-2"" line."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"My friend, always love your videos! 
Please can you review a Hagstrom Ultra max someday. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
Seems like something you'd do a great review of and I'm very very keen to know."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Is that a Blue or a Light Purple. On the screen looked more towards a light purple hue. Love the color regardless. Wanted to know in case I needed to recalibrate my TV
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,That periwinkle color is gorgeous!
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,You always have guitars that almost nobody has seen üòÇüòÖ
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,The F holes in those guitars are HUGE! üòÇ
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Great video nice looking guitar
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Wooden knobs gave it away for me...   I have a Deluxe DC...nice...but not an Eastman.  üòÅ.    DA pricing is odd...don't ever pay retail....they're not Gibson quality, tone, etc...but a very good Korean product.  $1400...nope.  Eastman T486 for $1400 (or less)...is a MUCH better sounding guitar than even the DA Deluxe (high end).   Thanks Darrell."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,I got to admit the thing looks pretty classy
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,"Thanks for wishing us a good day, Darrell. I'd be a lot better day if D'Angelico, Eastman, Schecter, Firefly and Xaviere would @-$#& have worldwide delivery, you know, as in for the places your channel can be watched from. Not the best day every time I've been sold on one of the guitars in your videos but remember I can't buy it cause I'm not in the US (despite being close, in Mexico). If they listen to you, please tell them, it's good busine$$ for everyone."
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Reminds me of a Gibson Birdland
10,J-Bvdp3KwJA,Neck pickup sounds lovely but I don't like the bridge p/u at all. Far too harsh and aggressive for my taste. I have got one of the very first Premier SS models without F holes which is very fat and creamy.

Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I would have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough
Did you ever fault me?
Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair out
Was only out of fear
That'd you find me ugly
And one day we'll disappear
Because what's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?
The- The boy's a liar (The boy's a liar)
The boy's a player (The boy's a player)

I just want to light things for you
Come stay with me, oh
You're not around to watch what I do
I thought you'd like those
Look about as gorgeous like me
Baby, please
I know you want to change me
Can you take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I would have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because what's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?

10,0NgZDrkaElk,"Truly wonderful, I'm not ashamed to say this made me cry. I recently lost a 15 year relationship and this really hits home, but at the same time is very healing."
10,0NgZDrkaElk,"Three 'singers' here, wonderful. Thank you."
10,0NgZDrkaElk,"Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't

I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't"

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"It looks solid, from the brief look we‚Äôve had, and that is the most important thing; a solid structure. I am a builder (more European/traditional bricks and mortar type) but if you can get the place weatherproof and warming through (which will expose existing problems) the rest is window dressing, so to speak. I‚Äôd be more than happy to help with questions and such, but in the mean time I wish you the very best of luck with your new venture! xx"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Looks like a big project, but I think it will be wonderful when you get everything fixed up. I think Odashi will enjoy the jets in the tub since she likes the hose so much.üòÅüëçüèª"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Use screening along the foundations. You don‚Äôt want the kids to get under the house and get into trouble you can‚Äôt help them out of. 
Also, you should get a pool like you have on the balcony of your current place and put it in the yard. A small piece of ‚Äúhome‚Äù will make a smoother transition experience. 
And lastly, make them their own bathing room that‚Äôs fully tiled. All of the water they‚Äôll shed coming out of the bathtub will ruin the hardwood."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Also, to prevent any expensive surprises, consult the local building regulations to see if there is anything you need to complete before using as a permanent home/dwelling etc. I hope you have fun along the way."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Thanks! I wish I could do more but I just wanted to say congratulations!!!!  I am over the moon happy for you all and love the work you do with otters! Best from California! Xx‚ù§Ô∏è

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Wow it‚Äôs a huge house and I love it, there will be plenty of room for the otters!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,That is a big house! And a very nice one! I think Odashi is happy with it.
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,a traditional Japanese home! with a central garden- I love it!! Congrats and good luck!!
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Como siempre, mis felicitaciones, por darles tan buen trato a las preciosas nutrias."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Congratulations!!! You deserve it. God bless you and the otters.
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Congratulations on your new house! My husband is in construction, and I can share some things from experience with having pets. I had outdoor cats and kittens to think about at one time. Make sure every single crevice on your property is fenced in or covered so they cannot dig and crawl under or climb over. Make sure the well and all holes that they could fall into or get stuck in are covered even if it is with heavy duty or grill-like wiring, including wide pipes. Decide if you want them to be able to go under the house and if not cover with lattice or some kind of fencing. The property is beautiful and spacious and all of you will love it! It made me think of the village in Okinawa in the movie The Karate Kid. Can't remember the name of the YouTube channel, may be otters home...not Dolce, Latte and Mocha's channel, but another one... They have a huge family of otters that spend all their time together, and they may be able to offer guidance. I'm so happy for all of you!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"lindinhos, linda a casa"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Wow! You could call that place Otter Mansion. I saw and understood that it would require a lot of making over to be 100% inhabitable, but the parts that have been remodeled once look great--and, little by little, you can remodel more rooms as you need them. I think a fence that can't be tunneled under will be more necessary than a high one since otters in the wild dig dens but don't climb trees. You have an expert in remodeling for otters that you can consult, Otterman, because he's built a nice home for Aty and Ui, although my understanding is that he wants to build them an even nicer home when he can. In fact, you and he might want to compare notes. The bathtub that Odashi swam in was a little small, so you might want to build a larger one indoors, a tank like the one in the otter kindergarten in Tokyo, and/or a shallow pool outdoors. That would allow each otter the opportunity to swim in their favored type of pool. (And I laugh as I add, ""Be sure that Odashi has shower equipment!"") Those are the first things that come to mind; but as you said, you're still in the very early stages of planning. Best of luck as you continue to develop your plans! Also, ‚ù§‚Äçü©π‚ù§‚Äçü©π‚ù§‚Äçü©π and best üêüüêüüêü to all the ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ and hoomans at ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ Cafe. (You're the best!)"

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Oooh i can't wait for the next steps for the ultimate human and otter home üíñ
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Congratulations! And All the Best Wishes for your new Home! This seems to be a great place, with lots of opportunities. - The first thing to do is to see that the roof has no leaks, after that - you have all the time in the world to make it your own Otter Mansion. ‚ù§ü•Çüçæ May You and the Otters life there Happily for years to come!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Congratulations on your new home. It looks big enough for guests and otters. If it's possible, one of the courtyards might be converted into a swimming pool where guests and otters could swim together. The otters especially would enjoy having room to swim and dive at speed without having to turn all the time. it might also be fun for them if there were little ""islands"" or some kind where loaches could hide while the otters hunt for them. (Otterman found a source for farm-raised loaches and sweetfish.)"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Oh, it's one of those old fashoined Japanese houses! That's so awesome, i can't wait to see it repaired! I'm sure the babies will all appreciate the finished product. <3"

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"You aren't kidding, that is crazy big.  If I lived in Japan, I would love to help you otter-proof your new place.  It's very beautiful.  You only need to design swimming areas and streams, with lots of plumbing and pumps."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Merci! Wow c'est grand! Odashi a d√©j√† l'air de s'y plaire! Je vous souhaite une merveilleuse vie dans cette maison! xxxxxxx
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Can't wait to see you move into the new home and all your ottter babies run wild~ü•∞üíï‚ù§Ô∏è
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"That's an absolute DREAM of a house, both for otters and non-otters üíïüíï and it looks like there are professional house builders among the channel viewers. Everyone has already given so many valuable suggestions, what else could be done? I'd watch for edges and sharp objects around, to avoid the otters getting hurt while they run through the house. And I would definitely ask for Otterman's expertise!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"A new adventure begins!  I am so happy for you all!  It will be a wonderful home for otters and humans!  There is a golden feel about the rooms, very warm and welcoming.  A loving energyüíõü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶ü¶¶üíõüíõüíõüíõ"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"You could build multiple ponds outside that are stacked on top of each other, sort of like rice fields. Then you could build small waterfalls that lead from one pond into the next. Should be a lot of fun for the otters."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"What a big, beautiful, old house with lots of charm. A heartfelt congratulations, you two!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Wow, that house looks amazing !!!! It's huge !! and the two gardens are going to be wonderful for the otters.  Congratulations on finding such a big place and I wish you much happiness living there.  My son is a very good house builder, but unfortunately we live in South Africa.  I hope you find a very good builder to help you renovate your dream home üíôüíúüíö"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"The house is superb with a large space outside. The garden is large and very natural. I will take this house. You saw Odashi felt good and she loves the tub. There is also room for new otters or to round up otters from kyoto and osaka. Maybe the price is a little expensive, but I think it's worth it. The renovation will be superb. Wasabi and Namida would love it, they who don't like to wear a harness and love to run. And Tororo, he also likes to run. And I think of Otsyu who doesn't like ballads, she could walk more outside in this big space. And if ever instead of a fence, a wall, the otters will not be disturbed by people from the outside and a wall protects better for people, children and otters."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"This house is a ‚ú®fantasy‚ú® Very happy moments await you in it. It has been a wise and wonderful decision, the fulfillment of a desired dream ü§ó Good luck with the reforms, everything will be great ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Make it into an otter ryokan! With an inner garden where they can run and where the guests can watch them play
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"That¬¥s an awesome house, like an Otter manor or mansion, is amazing that they will be able to run and take baths and all freely, so much fun congrats to Loutre family¬°¬° 
Hope u all have a lot of fun ‚ù§ü•∞
Also, I was thinking on a pool or someghing in some of the biggest areas of the house, Otters enjoy so much when they can swim on a pool and catch fishes, any idea in the future i¬¥ll try to type it hope the otters and fam have the best experience in new house üíúüíï"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Wow, the house looks great even though old and leaky.¬†
Will be very rewarding to fix up.
The otters will love it with all the nature!
It'll be like an Otter resort/onsen for visitors to enjoy.
Oh man, to take a nap with an otter would be so cool! Hahah!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"It may be old but it‚Äôs beautiful and with a little help it has so many possibilities! I think a great resource on constructive ideas is OTTERMAN, for sure! He builds stuff all the time! My heart is so so happy for you! Truly!"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,I am glad auntie Odashi approved the new home! ‚ò∫
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Holy Moly!!! That's one huge awesome looking place.
My first thought is, 'Make sure there is strong netting around the base of the house, you don't want the otters to run under the house.'
I'm not sure if Japan does the same, but you may also want to check roofing insulation too.
Fence wise, I know Otterman has built one, you could ask his advice. Especially as Aty is quite the escape artist."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Congratulations on the new house, it's really huge o.√∂ :3

I'm curious how it will look like in the end and wish you a lot of strength, endurance, health and patience <3 :3"

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,You have so many good ideas! There is room for guests to bring their own otters or enjoy spending time with yours. There are cat hotels like this in Japan. I never considered an otter version!
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,The house is beautiful! Perfect for the otters!
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Thank you Loutre for the tour of the new home. It's very large and with nice garden areas. Plenty of rocks for the Otters to play on. The house is so roomy that you can have as guests your other friends who have Otters. They can bring the Otters and you can all have fun together. The Otters will also be happy to be with friends. Congratulations on your new home and good luck with renovations.
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,It is a beautiful house. I love the traditional Japanese style. And it is big with lots of baths so the otters should love it. Yes it still needs some work but that is the fun of remodeling. What you have already done is beautiful.
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Congratulations on your new place I'm sure the otter's will love all the extra room. Thank you for sharing‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,The house is huge! The babies will love it. Odashi does!üíû

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Wonderful, spacious house and a yard on 2 sides! Congratulations on your new home! Is it a good advice to make a separate kitchen for preparing the otters food? A big sink, a big table, easy to clean flooring, fridge and freezer? I found it a relief with an independent working space for the animal rutines. It's good for a smooth family life and even guest and visitor activity does not interfere your otter feeding times."
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Wow!  So amazing and big!  Congratulations to you and your wonderful otter family!  Can't wait for more videos from Chateau d'Loutre!  ‚ù§üòä
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"It'd be a good idea to cap the well to make sure nothing can fall down it, make sure none of the rocks in the garden can fall over, make sure there's no wires/cables at ground level that the otters could reach - just things to otter-proof the house. Also, you're gonna need A LOT of wood varnish"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"There is so much to explore for the house! Its unfortunate that it's a bit rundown at the moment, but got to start somewhere, right? üòÖ

I don't have a lot of suggestions for the renovation other than having a large pool for the otters. That aside, I want to wish you the best for the renovation, LOUTRE! üëç"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,Omg your new place is amazing. I can I can envision otters playing tag in the back yard and sliding on the floors inside. Odashi already put her paw stamp of approval on the bathtub/shower.   Since I can‚Äôt fly over and help remodel (new job) then I want to donate.  I look forward to these videos every day..they make me smile and help relax me. I don‚Äôt know why but I have become a fan of ottersü§óüíïüíï
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"I don‚Äôt understand how comfortable a traditional Japanese house can be - this one is definitely very traditional. 
But I love the garden! There are so many rocks there - they remind me of the rivers Atyui visits:). 

How did the previous owners know that otters like rocks?:)"
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"AAAWWWWW!!!! Congratulations! So happy for you all! Sorry, I‚Äôm not mechanically or architecturally inclined, so I have no assistance to offer you at this time.

Have you considered hiring an architect to redesign the home for your needs and desire before you begin renovation or building.

15,zhfqSgLKVq8,What you‚Äôre doing for the welfare of the Otters is commendable! That house is beautiful once renovated. Hopefully an Architect will see this and advice you pro bono. Get rid of some of the rocks in the courtyard that you don‚Äôt need so Otters will have more space to roam and run around without harness. All of them will love this house. Odashi had the feel of it and got tired. I‚Äôm thinking of Toro now! Thx for letting us in  in your new & wonderful house.
15,zhfqSgLKVq8,"Very big and nice spacious house)) looks great for all fur babies you have)) and for visitors as well)) my advice will be to put one or two swimming pools for otters in the garden (or in one of those rooms, they are so big). They sure will play happily in it) I think a bathtub is a big small, it seems okay for one otter, but for two or more it looks small)"

15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Another great video. Always a bonus when you‚Äôve posted one.

Question. What are the red bands around the cow‚Äôs tail for?"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I'm a teacher and just thought I'd let you know me and my year 2 kids watch your videos on a Friday afternoon as a treat lol. They pick hoof GP over Disney any day!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"My husband laughs that I‚Äôm obsessed with cows feet, but your videos make me happy as you are helping cows feel better x"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I was excited to see another video, and especially with such a simple solution. Good thing you caught the issue before it caused more damage!"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I love it in cases like this, when the cow (or bull, of course), starts to walk away after you've treated them, and after the first few automatic limps, as it were, they realise it doesn't hurt anymore!

Graeme, forgive me if you've already done this, but when it comes the time for calves' first trim, could you do a video on it please? I've been trying to think when the best age is as a first go - whether it's more tied to teaching them about the crush or trimming the feet. Do you let very young ones run through the crush after their mother goes through first, so they get desensitized to it?

I would really love to see a video of this subject. Again, apologies if I've missed one, but I can't think of one from the list I've gone through!"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Thinking back to when I first started watching this channel (nearly two years now), and I feel like I've learned so much. It's completely useless info for me professionally, but it's incredibly satisfying to know/recognise things when watching"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"So many problems can be avoided by not working sloppy, i.e. snapping off knife points for your own convenience and not picking up the point afterward."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I really hope you show foreign objects to the farmer so they can investigate and try to ensure there aren't such things on the floor in the future, staff leaving sharps like that on the floor should be asked to stand on them with bare feet and see how they like it.
(Good to see Kev boy back, we were worrying where you'd hidden him)"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I admire the farmers and husbandman who own the cows you work on. Their work is hard and their commitment is stellar. They aren‚Äôt flashy but I admire their tenacity.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Another great video! Can't beleive it was the blade of a hoof trimming knife that was stuck in her hoof! Really glad it did so little damage to her hoof <3
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I like how it says 8 comments but there nothing here oh and it's so satisfying to see you care for their hooves. Also this why you shouldn't leave those ends on the ground. Or at least try to check around for those if you snap an end off by accident. Like even dumping ends on ground on purpose for any farrier is just not responsible if it wasn't an accident.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I adore you, and I love the great educational videos you post.  Thank you for your work :-)"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,SHE is such a PRETTY cow!!! Hope she recovers well!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Thanks for your videos.  Its a real eye opener to see how cows are treated while on the farm.  I'm a big believer that one should understand the processes involved in growing/raising food.  Knowing this makes me appreciate the farmers/ranchers even more.  Thanks again.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,‚ù§Another fabulous trim and fixed up cow as always Graeme ! You absolutely rock!!! It blows my mind that you have now pulled out two pieces of hook trimming knives out of a hoof and neither were yours üòÉ . Love that you made the cow comfy with not too much trouble. Keep up the fabulous work! We all love you ü•∞ and your team .  Craig and Kevin and Mrs. HGP when she is on üòÉ. Thank you.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I know they don‚Äôt get shod like horses so there‚Äôs not an abundance of sharp metal bits on the ground but the fact these farms don‚Äôt have one of those long magnet poles to sweep the floor with for metal shocks me. The minute any bit of metal breaks in a horse barn and we can‚Äôt find the pieces we check for it with the magnet
15,3fnMooQL1fo,That needs to be made into a necklace for the funniest conversation starter!! Great job as usual.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Your care towards animals is exceptional.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Great video. Nice to see you and the gang. As always compassion for the animal. ‚ù§
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"man, the sound of you modelling out the hooves in this are especially crisp and satisfying"

15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I think it just makes more sense to not use triming tools to open bags. Seems like an easily avoidable problem if that's the source. Hopefully it's not the cause this time, but I'm glad the other time had been investigated and that you got these hooves back in comfortable order."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Actually a question about your work came to mind when you damaged your blade.  How many spare knives do you keep with you?  Like when one gets damaged or dulled, do you have a backup on hand to swap to, in order to keep things running smoothly?"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,During COVID I watch hooves being replaced or repaired every day almost became obsessed with it.Just good to the animals taken care of and issues addressed
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"love your channel and videos, I can see the passion you have for doing what you do, thank you for channel and your content"

15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Another great video I really thought the spot on white line was going to be an issue , glad the piece of blade didn‚Äôt cause more bother than but of bruising a bit of farm staff tuition is needed  x"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Well done! Glad she‚Äôs out of pain! And you caught it before it caused more problems
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I know it's silly, but seeing the cows face makes the hoof repair more personal. Go ahead and laugh! But it's not just a hoof but a whole cow. Ok ok I'll stop now. Thanks for taking such good care of all the girls."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,These videos bring me a sense of calm.  My wife says my brain's turned to hoof.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Amazing, you would be in a lot of trouble, if you, dropped that knife end on our farm. My father had a large bucket , of bent nails, and yes we straightened them out, and reused them."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Wow, glad you found that knife hook end before it caused any major issues to the cows hoof. The farmers helpers should be more aware of picking up broken tips so that the cows ""don't"" step on them."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Thank you f for helping these beautiful creatures üíï
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I'm so cheerful when you post a new video. it always contains outcomes where the cow or bull wins out. You are a Hero.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Recently I watched a hoof trimming video by a hoof guy and there was such a huge difference in finesse with the knife. Graham you truly are a master of your trade.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I‚Äôm curious if you usually keep/collect the things you take out of hoofs
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Can you review why some cows need Dew Claw trims and other don‚Äôt? Breed? TY love your channel üíõ

He had a heavy accent and was only really understood by family, as we lived in Massachusetts.  To me you sound like ‚Äú HOME ‚Äú.    Thanks for what you are doing."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,do you find any difference between trimming a cows foot compared to a bulls foot? if so whats the difference
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Excellent work! As usual, a joy to watch you make your magic."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Thank you for making yet another üêÑ happy and healthy!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Is there any risk to the milk vein with a cow being in the sling too long?
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I had a chunk of glass the size of a small marble that was there for a decade growing up that made me HATE moving around, and if the cow feels anything like I did then that animal is gonna be walking on sunshine for the entire week."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,That was crazy. Who would not realize that these things can imbed themselves into a hoof? The mind boggles.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I am no cow expert, I work with horses. But I can't imagine any kind of barn/farm staff that would think it's OK to be throwing chunks of sharp metal on the ground instead of in the trash. Not just for the sake of the livestock, but also for the people, dogs, cats, tires, or machinery that it could hurt or damage as well. When the farrier comes he uses our  rolling magnetic ""sweeper"" to make sure he didn't accidentally drop any nail pieces that got nipped off, and if a boarder or staff finds bits of metal on the ground we always pick it up and trash it."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"My tire place keeps all the stuff they pull out of tires in a jar (nails, rocks, screws, etc). You should totally start a jar of stuff you pull out of hooves."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Amazing love for the job.  But it's the love for your care of the animal comes first.  You love your job.  We love watching every video.  To see you make sure that the care and well being of your crush guests.  We watch every video here in Maine, U.S.A.  Question? Do you have a jar too keep everything you pull out of the feet?"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Thought it was barb wire at first, but yeah I'm guessing it's best to number your knives for the day and at the end of visits when each knife is used and put back or discarded the tips are checked. Or drag a magnet across a work area."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I‚Äôm just curious. Have you ever relieved a cow of pain and they‚Äôve turned around to cuddle you as thanks?
15,3fnMooQL1fo,New viewer from New York. I stumbled upon your channel last week and can not get enough. I have been waiting for the newest video since subscribing to comment and say your great! I love your enthusiasm and passion for your profession. Keep on Trucking üòäüëç

15,3fnMooQL1fo,"That was my first thought for what it was too! It reminded me instantly of your other video where that happened. 

Good thing it didn‚Äôt do much damage to her"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I remember the video with the other cow who had the hook of the trimming knife stuck in her hoof! I can't imagine just knowingly leaving things like that lying in the ground. Even without the cows walking around, what if someone else got hurt with it? It could get kicked up by a piece of equipment and hit someone in the eye, if there are kids around one of them could pick it up and get hurt, a dog could swallow it . . . Seriously, people, invest in a magnet on a stick or something. They're less than $10, and could end up saving a lot of money on medical or veterinary bills."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Thanks for a great video!  Merry Christmas to you and your lovely wife and family!!!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Just gone done work, eating my dinner (spaghetti) and watching the Hoof GP...isn't that how everyone spends their evening??"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Nice to see a mystry solved and another cow happy and better off after your visit =)
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"It's just a brief moment, but I thought I saw yet another happy cow customer turn her head to look at you in thanks!"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Is it weird I knew what it was when you did the side view? Clearly I‚Äôve been watching a lot‚Ä¶ great job Graeme!!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Good that the crush lifts both feet. I'm impressed with that hydraulic operation
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I am not a trimmer nor do I plan to be. However the thought of people breaking off the hook of ya know, very sharp knives, and carelessly leaving them around the farm infuriates me. Ya know, in areas where animals walk? I imagion if the hoof gp's hook snapped by accedent he'd be searching the area and won't quit till the hook is safely secured."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I've watched so many of your videos at this point that I can eat while watching them 99% of the time. That said: kinda happy this wasn't a gross extreme trim. XD
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Enjoy your videos so much!!! Thank you!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I remember when you first found the knife tip in a hoof. You were astonished. This time you were been there, done that üòÑ"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Graeme cab I just say your hair is looking fucking brilliant mate it's grown out so well. 

Also happy for the cow."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I love the man bun you're sporting!!! Looks so good on you!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Hello from California GP your team family and all of the rest of your herd always look so forward to seeing all of your videos blessings always thank you
15,3fnMooQL1fo,You should do a compilation of all the times you've removed objects from cows' hooves. :)
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Another awesome video, enjoyed and keep um coming ty"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Hi Graeme!
I think you have to collect the things you found in the hoofs!
Good luck from Oregon USA!üëç"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I spotted it about 1:54 or so that it's a hoof trimming knife (and thought to myself, that's not the first time you've found one of those in a cow's hoof!)"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Just an idea for the what you removed from this cows foot.  Could clean it up really nice with it still stuck in the hoof horn and cast it in a clear resin maybe
15,3fnMooQL1fo,As soon as you said you've pulled one out before I knew it was a trimming knife and again knew it wouldn't have been yours!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Hello from Paris, France. I've not watched your videos for a while now, sounds like I've missed loads of news...By the way, I am missing so much Scotland. Lived in Gourock/Largs for 4 years. The most beautiful country in the World! Bises"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Would you have used a large rasp to trim the length before you had angle grinders?
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Just a little advice, would it be wise to get a small metal detector (hand held) I think it would save your grider blade."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,I can imagine her cautiously getting out of the crush expecting the foot to hurt.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,my name is James age 12 me and my dad do a lot of are own cows feet and my dad always  asks if The Hoof GP does this and how does the Hoof GP do this. We love to watch and learn off your videos .
15,3fnMooQL1fo,All the cows need   Graeme‚Äôs  magic touch
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"so let me understand this: they were buying specialized knives that didn't work for opening bags,  and modifying them; rather than buying utility knives that work great for opening bags."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Okay,  the hair is growing on me. It looks good now."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Bro you gotta learn vet skills so you can be a superhero for these cows more than you already are!
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Graham, I‚Äôve wanted to ask you how often you sharpen your trimming knives?"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Never would have thought it was your knife, not even once let alone twice. I hope they stop using those knives that way."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Good job üëçüëçüëçThank you for sharing. Be safe üá®üá¶
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Yay pulled the hair up!!! It‚Äôs not distracting now. Actually looks great
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I've always been wondering, how come you don't clean the hoofs before you trim?"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Keep up the good work and the good hair‚ù§
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"How would a knife hook snap off? I can imagine just getting metal snippers and cutting it off, or a knife so worn out that it simply just breaks off but if a knife is that worn down, you would be long overdue for a new knife."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"You said spike, and i thought nail, especially when you said there was a puncture near the toe. I was like, ""Oh my god, did a nail go all the way through this cows foot!?"""
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Love the man-bun! You've been at it for awhile, and we've been right there watching."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"First thought, ""Holy Cow (hehe), he cut his hair"". Great vid as always sir."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Another day being magic healing man! Does your merchandise ship to America?
15,3fnMooQL1fo,Where do all the hoof trimmings end up?
15,3fnMooQL1fo,You could set that into some clear resin and make a paperweight for the office or a Bolla Tie.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"Wow, people really need to be careful around all animals."
15,3fnMooQL1fo,If you do end up doing something with that piece I would recommend sealing it in epoxy.
15,3fnMooQL1fo,"I stumbled across you just by chance one day and binged watched you for a few days, then I had forgotten to sub so lost ya, but a vid popped up again a few months ago and now I'm subbed and oddly enjoying watching. I don't know what it is, but I just can't stop. XD Can't wait for more vids!

~~Kaleb~~"
15,3fnMooQL1fo,That‚Äôs improvement. The cow is happy. I‚Äôm really happy that it was not yours.

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"I would so miss the daily dose of Max and Dan and occasional visits from Dusty. But if Max is not feeling comfortable with being filmed regularly/daily, we just have to accept it. After all Max' well being and health comes first. üíöüíöüíö"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Whatever makes Max happy is what we want. We'll miss his daily cuteness but his well-being is important.
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,It's alright Dan. We all enjoy seeing Max and his antics but not if it's causing distress. Happy holidays!üéÑ
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"The instant I hear Max's ""squeaky toy"" sound, it just completely brightens my day!  

I love just love when he's happy and making his birdie noises."
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Even TV stars go on hiatus and there's plenty of Max reruns we can watch.  üíúüíúüíú
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,He has seemed disconnected lately with a few exceptions like yesterday. Do whatever you need to do!
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,He was quite the animated little boi with a lot to say. Beak fuzzy üòÅ. Even a star like Max wearies of the camera. His well-being is so important. Take as many breaks as the pair of you need. We understand. Love you all.
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Dan, all of you would be so missed. He's beautiful. Always makes me smile!
Max is far from stupid! He's well aware, have to respect that. Maybe keeping in tune at least once or twice a month just to see if he's receptive to that!
I know you have his wellbeing at heart. That's first and foremost
Much less is better then not seeing u guys at all.
Happy thoughts for today"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Glad that Max got his rest today ! Enjoy the day, all"

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Dan do weekly videos instead of daily or hide the camera.  Prioritising Max's wellbeing takes precedence over entertainment.
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Max deserves a video vacation and Dan too.  There are videos going back for several years now that we can re-watch until Max feels more like being on camera again. ‚ù§‚ù§
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Max is in a good mood! In spite of the fuzzy on his beak! But he does want to play with the air cleaner - are you being a bad boi, Max, or just trying to drive Daddy Dan crazy?"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Good morning Darling Max and Dan!  Our Max is in full Happy Form this morning - and we found the heater I see!  ‚ù§üòú Max, don‚Äôt you pop off the buttons on the heater! Daddy needs those!¬†

Dan, you‚Äôre the only YouTuber I know of who posts new videos every day. It is fair and right for you and Max to have a break from the Full Throttle mode you‚Äôve been on over the last 15 years.  Your lives do not revolve around YouTube. Perhaps You could post a new video twice a week and fill the rest with older Max videos?  There are so many amazing Max videos (‚ÄúMax‚Äôs Sweet Talk;‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo Work‚Äù to name just two of the Full Throttle Max Crazy (you may use that title if you wish üòÇ)) that new subscribers and older subscribers would enjoy. I rewatch my favorite older Macs videos all the time. Give yourself some credit and don‚Äôt assume that you always have to do something new and fantastic to be valuable on YouTube.  After all, how many people do you know take care of a large, talking bird with a beak strong enough to crack walnuts and a 2 x 4 like paper? Just watching you cook and showcasing your gorgeous holliday decos is entertainment in of itself! 

Have a great Friday everyone - I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs arrived!"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Max is one happy boy. He had a good nights rest.
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Awwww, that's okay. Max has been a shear delight for me. Whatever works for Max, works for me! üòçüòò"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"That's okay Dan, he prob wants you to himself for a while - he has to come first .., I will miss him .. but I wdnt want to be filmed every day üò£

Rest up Max , relax and take care you two ‚ù§ü•∞‚≠êÔ∏èX

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Google glasses or security camera is the way to go, Dan."
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Hi, just heard about a study (NPR radio segment today) released in the last few days about parrots and their communications, a project out of Univ. of Minnesota(?) They worked with 900 birds and their humans to determine the use of human language and other choices the parrots use to express themselves in various relationships and settings. It sounded interesting!"
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Goodness Max!  The T for in Trooouble is a flaming!  üòÇ.  If you need to take a break then do it.  Life is too short my friend.  I would miss the morning videos, maybe just switch to every other day."

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,That‚Äôs what happens to a lot of kids. My 2 year old nephew gives his my a PO look. I‚Äôd miss the daily video but understand. Max first.

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,I love how his beak is always open!
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,A short but very sweet Max video. I wonder where Max got the fuzzy from that's on his beak. I imagine that it's probably difficult for Dan to get that fuzz off without Max giving him some type of difficulty. Good to hear Max making  sounds and being chipper and lively with his toys. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüíØüòòüíïüåûüòò
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Do what's best for Max . It's very visible he's become uncomfortable regarding being filmed. Who knows the why's maybe resents sharing his time with you.
My little dog who's long passed now resented anytime I spent on a phone, PC, tablet . His mood would change drastically. Looking back now I wish I'd of ignored the devices more to make him happier."
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Love Max!  Thank 
you for the closed captions."
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Love the way Max plays. Just like a baby with a toy that makes noises. Cause and effect. He probably thinks he's a magician  
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Will miss mr max maybe a break will do him good üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø

15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Hi Max!
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,I know Mr Max is extremely smart but I'm hoping you can figure out a way to record him on the down low.
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,"Good morning, Crazy Bird."
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,We are talking today.good boy
15,4Umyo-J9Vw8,Beautiful creation of God seems to be in the mood todayüòá
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Oh wow what a beautiful scene we are treated to the most gorgeous horses appearing out of the mist it‚Äôs so breathtaking(of course they recognize your whistle Yvonne horses are incredibly intelligent beings and they remember who‚Äôs treated them with love and affection)I absolutely love the look in Risy‚Äôs eye when he sees you so soft and gentle he‚Äôs just the most handsome sweetest boy. Uniek doesn‚Äôt quite know what to do she‚Äôs got 2 of her greatest loves in one spot food and Yvonne üòÇüòÇin the end she will always come to check in with her beloved human Friesian‚Äôs are true gems of the horse world. Thank you for this amazing video full of sweet moments it‚Äôs wonderful to see your beautiful smile.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"It seems like a mystical morning with the horses in the fog and a strange white rainbow.  It's great to be out in the meadow with you again visiting all the horses.  Lianne sure hasn't changed, such a snuggle bug!  Risey's looking so big now and it's great to see Uniek back at Stal G with all her friends. Awesome video ü•∞"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Seeing Senna again in this video makes my heart ache in memory of the most loyal dog I've ever known, Rising Star has grown up and is a beauty.
The landscape even if it is shrouded in fog is beautiful to which the horses appearing in the sunlight are hiding, thank you Yvonne for all this ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Queen Unique is acting like she‚Äôs mad at you for not being around‚Ä¶.. she‚Äôs such a beautiful horse. It looks like Rising Star is happy to see you! Gotta say Yvonne the ‚Äúwhite‚Äùrainbow is beautiful! I can barely see color on both ends but that‚Äôs so beautiful‚Ä¶ the fog with the horses in the backdrop is a thing of beauty!!! Glad you‚Äôre better. Can you take Rising Star to your house and work him or even Unique? Or both!! I must say though, Friesian horses was new to me, and they are so beautiful‚Ä¶.."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I just love Queen Uniek and RS, as well as all the sweet horses.   I'm so glad that you are still with us for another Christmas too! :)"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,I really liked Senna.  She is missed so thank you for allowing us to still see her.  The misty rainbow is cool!  I am glad you got a nice photo of it with the horses.  The silhouettes of the horses in the mist with the sun in the background is beautiful.  Good call on visiting Stal G that morning!  You look great in your selfie with Risey.  I hope your recovery is going as well as you look!  üòÄ
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Johnny IS getting a bit fluffy,  huh?? ü§≠ü§≠Risey was SOO happy to see you!! As soon as you greeted him ... he knew that voice!! Thank you for showing RS ... he's gotten a BEAUTIFUL color for his coat & tall!! Quite stunning actually! üòç üíñ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüëèüëèüê¥üê¥üêéüêéüêé"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Risey is getting bigger and more handsome all the time!  Even though he's Uniek's adopted child, he is a lot like her with his sweet personality and they both have big beautiful eyes and nice physiques.  Idk how you describe that in equine terms. Also they still like to chow down first, especially Uniek.  Like she's saying to Yvonne, let me eat my grass and don't forget my pellets!  I know all the horses love Yvonne ‚ù§Ô∏è. The white rainbow and mist around the horses in the pasture was very mystical!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"That fogbow was so cool! I love how pretty all the horses look against the foggy sky, especially when you catch one that looks like the sun is sitting on their back! Very surreal and pretty! I can't believe how big Risey got! It seems like only yesterday he was a sweet little foal and now's he's a handsome young colt!‚ù§"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Beautiful just beautiful. The whole video was just stunning  like a movie scene. Then the star sweetie Queen Uniek in the meadow was just breathtaking. Risey has gotten so big and handsome and I know he sees his mama is back. It looks like he has his confidence back again before he was kinda lurking back behind Peter and now he pulling to the front again. I believe it‚Äôs knowing that Queen is near by and she gives him strength. All the horses look great üòäand are so peaceful to watch them in the meadow just gracing under that beautiful morning dew.
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"What beauty---the rising sun, the mist, the horses grazing contentedly, and over all that, a white rainbow. Now THAT was special! I know by now you are able to recognize all the horses again, but after all this time watching your channel, I can only recognize Sjors & Risey---so I guess my brain isn't working so well & it's NOT getting better, LOL! Greedy Uniek--if she had been a little less greedy for grass, she could have had pellets. Sweet, silly mare."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,The fog bow makes everything look so magical. What a peaceful morning at Stal G.  Lovely to see Uniek home and looking so well - ditto for Yvonne!  Risey looks amazing. I‚Äôll never tire of hearing Yvonne‚Äôs whistle and then watching each one of these glorious animals come to greet her. That is true magic!
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Risey ‚úÖ
Uniek ‚úÖ
Lianne chasing Yvonne ‚úÖ
This video is perfect üòö"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I was a bit teary-eyed seeing Seena again,I will miss her. As soon as you said Risey's name he immediately walked to you,you are most definitely his Mem. I have never seen a white rainbow but what it  made it really beautiful was that it was over the horses in the meadow. Hearing you calling Uniek and seeing her brought a warm smile to my face. What made me really love this video was not only seeing all the horses, the foals but hearing you calling their names and walking through the meadow. I am reminded this Christmas that God performs Miracles, you are His Miracle, Risey and Uniek's story was a Miracle. I believe more Miracles are on the way,the Best is Yet to Come!!! Thank you Yvonne. Love you xxx"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I love Johnny's braids. They really look good. Aww. Senna. I miss seeing her too running around. I see it like this. When you see her in videos like this, it's her way of saying ""Hello"" and that she is looking after you. Yes, I get an ache in my heart as well because she was, and still is, such a sweetie pie. I like the misty fog the field has, and the way the horses' shadows show through it. Risey is getting more and more handsome. Just beautiful all the way around ü•∞üòç"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Striking video with the horses in the mist under the rainbow. Leanne ever the sweet attention seeker. And Risey is so grown up and loving Yvonne. Thanks.‚ù§
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I looked it up. Rainbows happen when the air is filled with raindrops. You always see a rainbow in the direction opposite the sun. Fogbows are much the same, always opposite the sun, but fogbows are caused by the small droplets inside a fog or cloud rather than larger raindrops.  I have never seen one before. Really pretty especially with the horses in the forefront.  Good to see Yvonne's herd coming when she whistles."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Such an absolutely gorgeous video of all the horses in the mist with the rainbow and partial sun! Risey and the other 2 colts are getting so big and Beautiful
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Geweldig mooi de üåàis weer echt supper alle paardjes te zien Queen uniek weer van ouds geintreseerd in eten eten eten üòÇen Rising star wat een knappe boy en alle andere paardjes wat zijn ze toch allemaal mooi gegroeid was weer heerlijk om te kijken !!‚ù£
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Great to see a new video. It's as if the meadow is welcoming you back with that lovely fog bowüòä I'm both happy and sad to see Senna. She was such a presence around Stal G. Risey is certainly quite grown up now but he still comes for cuddles with Yvonne. Lovely video. Xxx
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Thank you for a video showing a beautiful autumn morning in Friesland, though I'm glad you started it in the stable so we saw all of the boys. RS, RJ & Pieter are so big now. The fogbow was amazing. You got some great shots of it, close up & at a distance. Someone else commented about one and I rewatched the video to see it, your shadow with that of a horse on both sides of you, very cool. Sounds like cuddlebug Lianne prefers her people with their feet on the ground. Interesting to see how she didn't want Sjors to get your attention. Hope the lure of her bix helped you get Uniek out of the meadow. Also, I'm glad you're feeling better and able to edit."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,My gosh it's so nice to see you back again with the beautiful horses . The Queen is always so nice to see again üíï üíõ üíì Rising Star is growing up fast. I'm glad you're dressed up warm it's cold here too. I never seen a white rain bow before. It's so magical horses in the fog.
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"So magical with the horses, the fog and the beautiful rainbow ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Lovely photo with the rainbow in the background!  Risey is really getting big.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Sun halo <3 I'm always surprised at how big Risey is. He was such a small foal and now he's... like a grown horse, lol."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Thank you Yvonne for this amazing video. Of course Uniek and Risey made it special . It was wonderful seeing the others; they come in a very close second. I love the fog, I grew up in an area where there very dense fog: fog is mysterious however a little eery. Still miss Senna. Johnny still looks quite handsome. Thanks again and much love to all.‚ù§Ô∏èüåªüåà"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Hi Yvonne, its so nice to see you and of course Queen Uniek, Risey - how big he has gotten!! Thank you for the videos, so glad you are better, keep up the good work.üê¥ü•∞üß©üêé"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Thank for sharing your beautiful world with us.  I had never seen a fog bow before, but one of your fans explained it to us.  Such rare beauty, I am so blessed to see your videos, Yvonne.  Do you know when Rising Star will start training?  I know you will take such great of this very special boy just as you have our Queen Uniek.  He is so beautiful and his eyes are full of a quiet joy."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"We've had  two days of fog..i love it tho bad to drive in. Its a great video, I love seeing you with the horses and our Queen Uniek..love seeing our young Prince, Risey..he is not so young anymore and has grown so much. Every time I see Reintje I have to go to tiktoc and watch my fav video of you two. Love seeing the rest of the horses and seeing Senna. Continued prayers..many hugs from across the ocean."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Lianne is not that sweet under the saddle??  It can't be so!!  Silly Lianne!üòÇüß°üß°
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"That unique formation is called a fog bow. Wow is Risey getting tall. For a moment I thought it was Sjors (until he stepped forward). Seeing loyal Senna was so sweet. And those horses will always know you, Yvonne."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,It's wonderful seeing you with Rising Star and most importantly the Queen herself! I was wondering if you have decided if you are going to let Uniek try to have another foal?
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"THANK. YOU, Yvonne.... Great video, so happy you were well enough to film and edit!
The Friesians , "" lost in the fog"" , were a slightly eerie sight, as they materialised from within the mist.... That rainbow... Astonishing!
,RisingüåüStar looking GOOD!
Uniek is SO smart... Trying not to come in.... "" Bad girl""... üëëüêéüòÇ

15,r68QpwWSzrc,What a beautiful video! I am so thankful that Yvonne is doing much better and feels like making the videos for us all to enjoy. I am beyond happy to see our Queen Uniek back!!

15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Risey is beautiful to see. Those three colts get along pretty well together!üê¥üê¥üíïüíï Yvonne, your memory is still doing well, YOUR HERD LOVES YOUüíïüíïüíï"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Risey is all legs again and still so affection to you though I believe Pieter is a close second. If Pieter keeps that personality like Risey he will be a great horse for someone. A special rainbow for a very special lady. ü§ó I truly believe they all missed you Uniek most of all. Did she ever give you a cold shoulder for a bit about you being gone and herself as well?
15,r68QpwWSzrc,What happened to Sienna? I am dealing with a health issue with one of my pets. Beautiful morning photography of the field with the arc above the pasture! Risey is all grown up!
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"What beautiful scenery! I continue to enjoy any video, whether you remember all the horses names with the correct horse or not. It is beyond me to recognize anyone but Risey, Sjors, or Walloubet. And Walloubet‚Äôs foal! You keep taking your time to heal, Yvonne, please!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Yvonne's herd! Beauties every one!  Rising Star is SO BIG now and very handsome. I love the rainbow!  Thank you for sharing!  God Bless you all. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêéüêé
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Dear Yvonne  it is so wonderful to see you with the horses that you love! RIP Senna ‚ù§‚Äçüî• what a wonderful girl she was! I cannot believe how mature Rising Star üåü is and he still loves his Yvonne!! What a beautiful morning in the meadow, almost supernatural  with the fog rainbow!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"As soon as Lianne saw Yvonne, she was right there for some love üíï and then she chases Sjors away for more! Lianne is still my favorite, of course after Uniek and Risey ü•∞üòõ. 

You look and sound fantastic Yvonne! Keep up the good work with your recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π. Love from Maine ü¶ûüá∫üá∏"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Wow! Risy has grown into a nice horse‚ù§ Uniek & you raised him nicely. ü•∞
15,r68QpwWSzrc,I love seeing the rainbow.  It just makes the day better.  I am also looking forward to watching Rising Star start training for his future.  Who will ride him and in what events.
15,r68QpwWSzrc,From the first time I saw one of these videos I've been half convinced these horses are magical this rainbow kind of pushes me over the edge they are magical üíñ
15,r68QpwWSzrc,What does the future hold for Rising Star?  What are the plans for him?  It's wonderful to see Yvonne back with all horses and the white rainbow.  That's a nice Christmas present.
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I‚Äôm glad you did not walk across that bar! Or try to.   The fog, wet grass, horses were awesome enough but the white bow puts it over the top. Wow!  You did quite a bit of walking and greeting out in the field. That‚Äôs good to see. I suppose this was at least several weeks ago bc Senna was in the vid. üò¢ I bet she‚Äôs greatly missed. She was special.   And I couldn‚Äôt help but think how special Risey is when I saw him in the barn and you were petting him.  Wow. What a story. Thanks for sharing. Stay careful!‚ù§"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"I missed it. What happened to Senna? Today's video was very interesting.  Wonderful to see all the horses, even better to see Yvette and how great she looks, as she makes a most remarkable recovery. And the Queen... a magnificent  equine.  Even Risey... he's  a BB (Big Boy) now. Gorgeous.  I loved the views of the heavy mist. Very spooky, until those great horses slowly materialize in the mist. Seeing a fog rainbow was a first for me... so thank you for that, as well as the all round Frisean update. Stay safe..."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"‚ù§ Love how they always come to greet you Yvonne, what a beautiful relationship you have with these horses. The love and trust is a beautiful gift!!!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,A beautiful relaxing video. Have a great day
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"beautiful risey, and the white rainbow magnificent."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Rainbows happen when the air is full of raindrops . You always see a rainbow in the opposite direction of the sun. Fogbows much the same, opposite the Sun, but fogbows are caused from small droplets in the fog, instead of large droplets that make a colorful rainbow. They are called white rainbows, cloudbows, or ghost rainbows.

15,r68QpwWSzrc,"That was called a ‚Äúsun dog‚Äù, I think!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"A fog bow, I think."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"This video is from September 30, 2022, great to see Senna the beautiful ridgeback, what a sweet doggie she was.  The video was magical in the mist and morning white rainbow.  Yvonne you looked the picture of health.  God Bless YOU!!!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,I am a Jacobien fan.  she's just so big yet graceful.   She's my favorite of the ladies
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"What a lovely, misty morning! The horses eating peacefully and looking beautiful ( if a little mud flecked). Lianne loves you so much and was very jealous of Sjors. Speaking of Sjors, he temporarily joined the Friesians in looks due to the fog and rising sun. Ah, sweet Senna lives on in your videos and my heart. üíï Jacobien. I think you put in your walking rehab in that huge meadow, stay well."

15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Oooo sweet sweet girl,how awesome to see you among the beauties!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,What a beautiful landscape and scene.
15,r68QpwWSzrc,What beautiful prints it would make of Uniek in the mist and with the rainbow. Of course they remember your whistle they love you so much. So happy you are doing better it‚Äôs just wonderful to see you in the meadow again.‚ù§
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Liebe Yvonne,

Vielen Dank f√ºr die ganzen Videos in den letzten Tagen/Wochen. 
Jedes Video ist sehr gut geworden. 
Dieses heute aber ganz besonders, denn einen Weissen Regenbogen sieht man eher selten üòäüòä.
Du siehst in jedem Video besser aus.
Ich hoffe, dass Du Dich auch so f√ºhlst.
Deine Fortschritte bei deiner Genesung sind echt zu Bewundern. Mach weiter so üòäüòä.

Aber Pass auch auf Dich auf. Ruhe viel und schone Dichüòòüòò

15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Wooo new Friesian Horses video!
I love it when the horses just wander after Yvonne in order to ask for more attention, it's just so cute!"
15,r68QpwWSzrc,Thank you so much for this beautiful and amazing video üòä!!! Absolutely breathtaking üòç‚ÄºÔ∏è
15,r68QpwWSzrc,This is a really pretty picture of the horses under the fog bow. Very cool!
15,r68QpwWSzrc,The white rainbow thing you see it called a Fog Bow. It is very cool to see it live. :D Hope you are well and thanks again for the videos. <3
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"It‚Äôs an icebow!  It‚Äôs caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals at a 90 degree angle (from the side).  Higher in the air, but no more marvelous than horses and old dogs whose love will inhabit our lives long after we can no longer see them with our eyes."
15,r68QpwWSzrc,"That was a good long walk you had through the meadow with the ladies and Sjors. You are steadily improving in your health, it‚Äôs wonderful to see. The herd looked beautiful in the misty morning, and that misty rainbow was special. I was quite taken with Tsjerk, he‚Äôs an absolute stunner. Best wishes to all at Stals G and H, thanks for sharing another lovely video."

15,r68QpwWSzrc,"Very nice one! Long and relaxing. We call them white rainbows, or fog bows--we get them too in the morning and at night during the sunrise/sunset time if the weather is right. Looks magical! So nice to see dear Senna as well. She had a well loved and well lived life. Uniek is definitely her usual self enjoying her grasses! I'm supposed to get my Uniek Christmas shirt in a couple of days, very excited!"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Big respect for saving the poor pittie üòá
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,You can tell when these poor souls have never had an ounce of human kindness or ever known a loving touch. What a sweet baby girl. Thank you so much to everyone involved with this rescue üôèüèΩ

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"These are the stories that uplift us and give our humanity hope and that it's going to be ok. Saving the life of any animal and taking the time to actually get involved is huge. So many would have just gone on by. To this soul who rescued her, my appreciation and thank you for your kindness and love. You rock. I believe every kind act is a ripple throughout the world. It does matter. Bravo."
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,You were meant to see and love her. Bless you for saving her and giving her the life she deserves. It breaks my heart at how awful people can be dumping animals like garbage... you are both blessed to find each other. Much joy and life to you all.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Now, every time I see a blueberry, I will be reminded of this beautiful story. Thanks for saving her Ms. Shena. I agree with the others here in the comment section‚Äî you are an Angel. Thanks for sharing this. Cheers!"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,She was all alone in that blueberry field w/her broken leg and  lost all hope. Her angel came by & look at Blueberry now ü§ó
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Blueberry is a testament to how forgiving and loving dogs will be if shown just a little love.   She's an awesome dog and I'm so glad that you decided to be her mom.  May you have many years together.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,That's terrific! Her life is now what it should be! Thanks to everyone!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Girl, you are an angel on this earth!"

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,This brought tears.  Thank you for saving this sweet girl and giving her such a great home.

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"I'm so glad you didn't carry on thinking that black bundle was just a black bin bag. I'm really glad you went and had a closer look cause not many people do, I one time found a kitten in a black bin bag but sadly it was too late üòî. At this this gorgeous girl got a second chance üíñ‚ù§üêæüêæ"

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"This is one of my favorite videos I‚Äôve ever seen on the Dodo. Yes, Sheba, I think Blueberry was meant to be in your life. If there is such a thing as a soul dog, I think she‚Äôs it for you."
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Thank you for saving her. God bless you more and more for doing these kind of things more and more. The world need people like you.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Thank you for respecting her life üíú
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,From having nobody to love her then going to wearing clothes that are the color of your name. We all need stories like this. Love you Blueberry and your mom that saved you!!

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,That is such a beautiful story indeed. We just adopted a 7yo staffy cross and was the best thing we have ever done.  I have also felt the sad dog to incredibly grateful and loving dog feeling too. There's nothing like that feeling. Thank you and greetings from Adelaide Australia

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Awesome rescue by a wonderful person.  You were determined, so Great job getting help for poor Blueberry!  (For pet owners who haven‚Äôt heard, pets can carry dangerous parasites. I met a Calif. woman who lost 90% of her liver due to picking up a sheep liver fluke from a friend‚Äôs dog. Truly. So don‚Äôt let pets lick your face or mouth, even though we love them. For a huge amt . Of science detail on parasites & pets, read Hulda Clark‚Äôs books, A Cure for All Disease & others.)"

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Wow that leg looked _awful._  I was sure she was going to lose it.  Great job by the rescuer and the vets :-)
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"I could watch videos like this endlessly, and I do. They are just so satisfying and when the dogs end up happily ever after there is NOTHING better than that. NOTHING! Blueberry is perfect and so are you. Thank you for being a generous soul."
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,It‚Äôs so incredible that just exactly the right amazing person noticed her in the field and figured out it was a dog!! ‚ù§‚ù§ thank you for this incredle rescue and then adopting her! God bless this lady!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Extremely kind and awesome save. I'm glad poor Blueberry's leg seems to have recovered with all the help. Definite foster fail because she and her Mom are great.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,I'm so pleased she named her blueberry and adopted her. I'm sure it must have been a much easier transition for blueberry having her rescuer be by her side through the whole journey and become her momma.

15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Well spotted!!! ..Poor girl. Wonder how long she had been laying there! 
She did look like a black bin bag. I bet alot of ppl wondered that and kept on driving. 
Soooo amazing that you adopted her! Ha! 4 dogs and a couple of cats?! What a blessed place to be! 
Blueberry is ofc absolutely wonderful (as all pitties are!) and I love how podgy she is. Lol 
Have a wonderful life together ‚ù§"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,I've come to learn that it's us they come to save. They are such amazing companions guiding us through our difficult times.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,I love her pittie smile!! I wouldn't be able to let her go either.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Thank you for checking her out & then following through by taking her to a vet. I wish more people would care for animals like you did. And you each got a special friend in the end. God bless you.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"My family recently ""fostered"" a mastiff mix too until the owner was located. He looked like he had been on the run for a while. Kind of worked out the same way your story did. ü§£"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,3:24 the way she leaned her head she knows you got her back ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,She's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL & thank you to everyone that helped save her. üíúüê∂üêæü§†üôè
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Blueberry is adorable and goofy. I'm so happy she was rescued by her amazing human!!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Bless you for saving her. You can tell she adores you ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Wonderful story. She looks SO much like my rescue pitty - same markings and personality. My girl was found and rescued from hurricane Harvey in Houston in 2017. Best dogs ever!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"My 20 something daughter rescued a pity and ""Poppy"" is a wonderful loving dog. She's very gentle, quiet and obedient. The dog wasn't abused, just unwanted. My daughter spoils her. 
She wanted to be a vet, but we just couldn't swing the cost of school and the low average pay of a vet. 7 years of school and an average pay of less than 60K. 
People respect your vets. They're most decidedly not doing the job for the money."
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Kudos to you shena!! 
Blueberry is a little cutie patutie‚Ä¶ ü•∞ I‚Äôm so happy you found each other‚ù£Ô∏è
üíôü´êüêæ"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,A beautiful story!  Your blueberry is a stunner and I love the love you both have for each other!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Much respect üèÜ
Deep thanks ‚Ä¶
You are an inspiration and a TRUE animal HERO üéâü•á
*Absolutely nothing but sincere LOVE for sweet sweet ü•∞Blueberry ü•∞ as well üòòüòò!!
Pit bulls make FANTASTIC domestic animal pals üêï!
Super loyal and very gentle. 
Very very misrepresented and misunderstood. It‚Äôs such a waste bc most ppl REALLY do not understand what a bad wrap these great animal companions get. That‚Äôs ALL media produced AND hyped up.
Granted, there have been problems relating to the breed. However, the core reason this occurred was SOLELY due to HUMANS. 
Humans who were entrusted by God to be good stewards of the animals on earth, FAILED them instead.
The hormones pumped into them, the brutal exercise regiments, abuse to anger and frustrate them‚Ä¶ MAN caused that‚Ä¶ not the pit.
BLAME MAN!
If you‚Äôve got the space and the money‚Ä¶ The compassion, time and love‚Ä¶ And can give a good pittie or two, a warm, safe space (a forever home üè° üêï‚ù§) PLEASE don‚Äôt hesitate to do so asap. 
They are so deserving. 
Being friends with them is incredibly rewarding. They repay your love and care to them a million fold. 
Give them a chance, be very patient if need be.. such as in this story. They are WELL worth it  ‚ù§‚ù§
Thank you üôèüèº"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Can you imagine being in that dog's position and suddenly out of nowhere this angel comes and makes you better and loves you and gives you an affectionate posse of friends forever and ever??
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,Ahhhh I love this video. Thank you so much for rescuing that dog. You both were meant for each other. The cat was adorable!!
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,It's always nice to see someone showing how sweet a Pittie can be when treated with love. Soul Dog. I have to remember that.
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"That was lovely what you did; you not only saved that little girl you gave her a life, too. You should be very proud of her, and yourself aswell. Bless you ! 
üòÉ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ó‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ‚úåÔ∏èüññüëã"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"This makes me laugh and cry at the same time, thank you for rescuing that poor girl, I got to tell you she's living the life now, you deserve each other, may you both have a long and happy life together, damn this old biker Railroader loves a happy ending LOL"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,"Aww bless her...she's had puppies at some point you can see,  possibly used as a breeder then thrown out because of one reason or another, its sickening.    I'm so glad you found her and fixed her body and her heart ‚ô•  thankyou so much ü§ó"
15,sZuCM_3L5y8,THANK YOU for rescuing this beautiful girl. Her happiness made my day! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I can‚Äôt believe how calm she is with that collar on. I thought for sure she‚Äôd be freaking out trying to get it off.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Love that it detects her purrs. That‚Äôs very cool. Scratching the pole actually is a sign of her being happy and content. She was glad she was home. Maybe not liking being picked up but she was happy her humans where both home. Now it was normal to her. Cats usually pick one human as their favorite. Get another one Chelsea and it will be yours don‚Äôt let him near them at first LOL üòÇ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella always cracks me up. I love how she love love loves trev but almost despises chels üòÇ i feel so sorry for Chelsea but  it's always so funny üòÇ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,The fact that she purrs more whenever Trevor goes near her just melts my heart. She loves him so much.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"You  guys have absolutely won her love! It is also nice to know my cats are not the only ones who are obsessed with those tubes. I also feel the need to say even when it seems like a cat may not like you, they absolutely do, they just love you in a different way, if it was just her I imagine she would show affection very differently."
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Hey Trev! I just wanted to say I‚Äôve been following along for a couple of years and every Sunday you,Cooper,Koda,and Chels put a smile on my face!‚ù§Keep up the good  work!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Chels' hair turned out beautiful! Hopefully she feels better soon from that exhausting appointment
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I think her hair looks beautiful no matter what ‚ù§Ô∏è she's stunning. And Bella murdering her Xmas tree just made my Sunday üòÖ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Can we just take a moment to appreciate how kind Trevor was to Chelsea at the end. Shes was obviously upset about her hair appointment but I feel like he did such a good job validating her
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I'm surprised Bella left it alone all that time. Her purrs are so sweet! ü•∞
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I know I'm more of a dog person but Bella is the cutest little ""demon child house panther"" I've ever seenüñ§ And yes, that is going to be my new nickname for her from now onü§£ Y'all keep up the good work on your amazing vids and I hope you can get power back to the lights and anything else that needs fixed soon"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Bella is so sweet. I'm surprised that she didn't mind that collar on her, I thought she'd try to get it off. Also her purrs are so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I love how far the relationship between Trev and Bella have come, from a little kitten, Trev not being a cat person, Bella being left at their door, initially thinking about giving her to a shelter, to a full grown cat, and absolute besties, enough to make a grown man cry :,)"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,She loves Trevor a lot  she is wrapped around his finger.  My biggest question is if both of them saved her why is she more fond of Trevor  and not Chelsea   also Bella purring was magnificent. And Trevor the ending you holding her was sweet   Awesome vlog   Chelsea we love you  You  are magnificent.   Trevor we really need to find out why Bella is mean with Chelsea its really heartbreaking.  I can see the hurt on her face genuinely  in this episode. I‚Äôm a bit emotional  as I say this
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Bella, liking how you interact with your purroundings with purrs! üòª 

Your lights are still out from that lightening strike?!?! Good way to save money ! üòä"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Comical video as usual! We look forward to the videos every Sunday!! Jamie and Kathy
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I always look forward to Sundays Trev, been watching for a very very long time, and how stubborn Bella can be, I'm surprised she didn't the camera off, love you guys and hope you have a good week!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Cats like sunbathing because unlike us humans, cats are at a higher temperature then us, so our houses are on the chilly side for cats. Cats body temp is around 38.9C (102F) so I bet if you got her a heating pad she would love it. When cats are sleeping there body cools down so she just getting chilly and it turns into an uncomfortable nap for her. Hence the move for a new sun spot."
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Bella is so cute and funny! üòÇ Also Chels' hair looks very beautiful! üòç

Do you know when you'll be uploading another PO Box Opening video? As those are my favorites to watch and me and my partner have been really wanting to send you something someday to show our love and appreciation that we have for you all! ü•∞ Thank you for putting a smile on our face and making us laugh with your silly shenanigans! üíñü§™ 

P.S. Koda is our favorite but please don't tell the others! üòâ"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EPISODE ALL FROM COOP, KODA, AND BELLAS PERSPECTIVE. LIKE A P.O. BOX OPENING OR COOKING EPISODE, BUT ALL FOOTAGE ARE ONLY FROM THE PETS POINT-OF-VIEW"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bellas purrs are adorable. And im loving that cam collar. Also greetings from TX
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Omg this has got to be my fave super cooper Sunday episode üòÇ look at those wittle paws!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç and the purrrrrrrrrrssss. Omg I‚Äôm dead from cuteness overload üòÇüòÇüíóüíóüíóüíóüíó
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Aww‚Ä¶we love you Chelsea ü•∞ But, Bella‚Äôs love for only Trevor is so funny üòÇ She is daddy‚Äôs girl all the way"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella is so cute. I think Bella was feeding off of Chels being upset with her hair appointment. Don't give up Chels.üôÇ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Always love Bella content. :)
15,7_QIcZsEILI,It‚Äôs still sad to think of how long Chelsea wanted a cat and how many times she talked to Trev about getting one. Then out of nowhere they have one dropped off on their front porch and the cat immediately bonds with Trevor and doesn‚Äôt want to have much of anything to do with Chels.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Almost 5 millions subscribers,  Keep up the great work Trevor üòä"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,This was a fantastic video! It's so fun to see things from a cats perspective!
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"The video was fun!
Bella seems to enjoy some things and hate some!
But I‚Äôm pretty sure that Bella does love Chelsea but has a different way of showing it!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Ahhhhh I love this episode üíñüíñüíñ the little paws running so adorable
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I haven‚Äôt been feeling good I got strep throat but after watching this video I already feel better I love your videos so much they always make me happy
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I‚Äôm so excited to watch! I love the Insta360 so much, and I hope to get it soon! I‚Äôm excited to see Bella‚Äôs reaction!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I love how this felt like a nature documentary üòÇ. Great video as always!
15,7_QIcZsEILI,this is such a cool video i didnt think the camera would work that good love the vid trev
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Awesome episode, have a happy Sunday!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Well you can totally tell that she's Daddy's Little Girl Bella is so adorable it was nice seeing the boys too can't wait for the next video who's so cute that she was pouring you guys are awesome
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella truly loved being the center of attention. Thanks for sharingüéÜüéÜ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Can we get a monthly episode of Koda & Bella shenanigans?
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I‚Äôm so happy they decided to keep her, since she was dropped at their door I was pro cat"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I love your videos! They are always amazing and make me so happy. Wish you well and Bella seems so sweet! Even though she is just the total opposite to Chelsea. XD
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I think there should be a little mini series about Bella‚Äôs pov
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Aww, love the Bella content! So sweet that Bella purrs whenever Trevor is close by."
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I absolutely love this! She loves you so much , her noises are amazingly sweet  ü•∞"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,When she was making biscuits! So cute ü•∫
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella's so cute when she gets the collar on üêà.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I think it would be fun to see Jackson Galaxy come and give Chels some tips on building a bond with Bella :)
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Yaaaay! A Bella episodeü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ
15,7_QIcZsEILI,LOVE U GUYS AND UR VIDEOS MAKES MY DAY!‚ù§
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"I was actually watching some Bella episodes yesterday and I was wondering ""are they gonna do a Bella episode today? "" and you did! And I was so happy!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Finally a video with Bella! I got my dog today and his name is Cooper and is also a golden retriever lol.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I hope Bella gives Chels some purrs sometimes
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Cooper is my favorite, he‚Äôs so cute and spunky! üòä"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I'm surprised chels waited 8 hours to get her hair done. Patience on another level
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Chelsea's hair is stunning. I hate it getting dark at 5:30pm here in Georgia as well. The days are too short now. I am so glad you did a video on Bella. It always seems she gets left out most Sundays. She did so well with the collar camera. I am impressed.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella purring is so cute.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,My brother has two calico cats and the one is the exact same as Bella with Chelsea towards me. She is on and off about being ok with me while the other loves to come in and just chill with me. The first cat however is now obsessed with my brother's gf which is hilarious to watch. This cat probably loves the gf more than the cat loves my brother at this point.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella absolutely loves you Trevor.  That is the way cats are you don't choose them they choose you.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Omg bro Bella loves u so much! I have 3 black cats, so happy that you and C adopted her, and that you called out the poop humans that dropped her on your doorstep"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Bella reminds me of my cats here in my house I love the day in the life of your dogs it makes me feel good to see that to let you know that i have B-Cell A L L Lukemia any time I see you it makes my day even better. Unlike Bella my cats have very different personalities when I see Bella she is like them in a way she is a easy going very playful at times and also as you said very lazy that is the definition of my cats right there. When she is pawing like that she is like my cat Lewis in a way when she does that. Much love my friend from reno Nevada
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"happy Super Cooper Sunday, Tmartn, Cooper, Koda, & Bella!"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,Love the Bella videos! And love the Christmas slippers Trev üòÇ

15,7_QIcZsEILI,I LOVE this!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,7_QIcZsEILI,"Bella is such a confident girl. I don‚Äôt know how to support my kitty be as confident. 
What Jackson Galaxy calls ‚ÄúCat mojo‚Äù"
15,7_QIcZsEILI,I reckon it would be nice for Bella to have a cat friend. I highly recommend you guys to adopt another cat. I have 2 myself. They keep each other company.
15,7_QIcZsEILI,O coopie .. so cute when tired ‚Ä¶ runs down as soon as he finds out chels is home ‚Ä¶ Bella is like mom put me down ‚Ä¶ meow m..e..w..o ‚Ä¶ silly cat.. that camera thingy works fine on her .. cool

15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Taylor, you have done a wonderful job. God loves that you cared for one of his creatures. Blessings shared is God's way."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Animals can be our best friends if we show them we wish to co exist with them. They more than anyone know the dynamics of life. We could learn a lot from the animal kingdom.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Wonderful thing she did.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Many Thanks to her for saving a life.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"So sweet I wish she would have released him when his father was visiting him and he could have shown him where he and his mother were nesting, but now she can always check on him and he will NEVER forget her kindness. üíï"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,So kind of you to save that little baby.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Mam, you have the heart of an angel and we're grateful to you for loving and caring for this beautiful bird. You are part of our family. Thank you and Thank you Dodo for another animal family member. This beautiful bird survives and thrives!"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Thank you for rescuing little Petrie‚Äôs life! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,13ZpupaiVGw,find a girl who cares about nature and be grateful to be so lucky. one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and I'm not just talking about external beauty.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,I did that once.  Raised the baby to full feathers and kept him for a long time.  He was special.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,So sweet! A mama sparrow brought her baby daily by us for food and now he comes everyday for food right by the window and wait for us. I call him sweettooth üòä
15,13ZpupaiVGw,You're truly a beautiful woman Taylor. Thank you for saving the baby bird.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Wonderful! Thanks for rescuing him!
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Caution:  This story is overflowing with sweetness.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"What a gentle, nice soul Taylor is. She's beautiful inside and out. Thats nice how the birdie nested right near her haha. I guess thr bird didn't want to go too far."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Sparrows are smart and sweet. Highly engaging even without rescue. Humans would be the dumb ones.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"it's amazing you are a woman who loves animals.Thank you so much, the sparrow is so cute üëç"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"OMG! So beautiful!
And the bird was cute too."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,What a lovely rescue! Congratulations x
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"How often did she have to feed him when he was rescued, I wonder.  Every 2 hours?  3?  Can't have been easy.  He would never have had such a soft, warm blanket like that to sleep in.  Sometimes, it's good to be rescued by a good human."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,You're truly a beautiful woman Taylor. Thank you for saving the baby bird.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Sweet, loving woman - thank you."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"What a wonderful story & a wonderful lady to go to all that care for one of God's little creatures.  She has a place reserved in heaven, along with her little baby."

15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Many birds have almost no sense of smell, except some vultures, that rely on smell to find carrion, for example.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not true that if you put a baby bird back in the nest when possible, the parents won‚Äôt care for them.  They absolutely will.  She did a good job here."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Great job Taylor ! I love and appreciate you for raising Petrie ! üíñ
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"You did a good deed Lady, well done."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Many years ago birds built a nest on a beam under our roof. One day we found a baby bird (eyes closed, no feathers) on the ground below the nest. The mother was circling around him. Immediately we put him back in the nest. A couple days later he or one of the other babies was on the ground again and we put the baby back in the nest. A few days later one of the poor babies was stuck and dangling upsidedown from the nest. We carefully unhooked him and put him back. None of us could handle finding more babies on the ground or dangling. It was a miracle that none of them died to begin with.  So we made a second nest and put it in a box and nailed the box right next to the original nest. The box was enclosed except one side which was fully open to the nest and another side was cut just low enough for the parents to fly into. No more babies on the ground or dangling after that! And they used the second nest. The popular spot and our makeshift box nest was used for years. All happy, beautiful birds!"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Sweet lady. Did everything right and then gave Petrie the best of both worlds. Well done!
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"I think you're awesome Taylor...good for you! So proud, thanks for looking our for the little ones of the world. Big time hug!"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Omg it was so adorable!
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Please don't do this unless you're a credited wildlife professional! Not only is it potentially harmful to the animal, it's also illegal. Take it to a wildlife rehab."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Two sweet souls put together üôè‚ù§Ô∏è
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Thank you for saving Petrie.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Great job! Typical out of the nest, type kids and birds. Some nights away, others home with mom. Lol!"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Love to know what was in the syringe. Well done. Inspiring.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Excellent job! Right back to the wild fearless.  You did great
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Nice to see stories on the Dodo...they have such wonderful endings. Thank you Do for restoring my faith in humanity.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Pretty amazing.  Great job.

15,13ZpupaiVGw,It's a heartwarming story ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Lady was nice and beautiful inside and out ‚ù§
15,13ZpupaiVGw,They don't have to go back into the nest. I've put them in boxes (up high so cats cant get to them) and the moms will often hear their chips and come feed them anywhere.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Everyone please listen, if you see a baby bird that needs help, please bring it to a wildlife rehabber. This isn‚Äôt a good idea to take care of it on your own"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"I think you should add disclaimers about rescuing young birds (when do you need to step in and what you can do to help find the parents first)
In my experience a  wildlife specialists  can give advice that will risk an animal's death sadly  so always use common sense too, its better for the baby to be in the hands of their parents but if it means leaving them where predators can get them .....so glad this worked out , birds returned to their parents after being rehabilitated   <3"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,That is awesome Totally awesome It's one thing about it you know unconditional love Cause that bird's gonna love you forever
15,13ZpupaiVGw,This one of my favorite Dodo videos!  üê¶ ‚ù§üòä

15,13ZpupaiVGw,So Sweet!!!.
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"That male wasn't Papa, that was Daddy."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"I think the misconception about mama birds ""not coming back"" is because they can't physically get the baby back into the nest and so people assumed the mama is abandoning it. In reality, they just physically can't do anything for their baby to get them back into the nest. Once a baby has fallen from the nest, only a human or other animal could get the baby back inside, and if you can't, and the bird can't, then the baby has to adapt. I've seen babies stuck on the ground where I'd get them under a rose bush for protection, and the parents would perch near the rose bush. They couldn't do anything much, but they could perch, watch, and potentially bring food to the baby. But if people don't watch for that behavior, they were just like ""oh I guess it was abandoned"". It's good that you kept bringing it outside because that gives the parent birds a chance to see that the baby is still in the area, even if they can't reach it. It's too bad you couldn't reach the nest. I have a tree in my yard that had some matted old branches that formed a sort of ""cubby hole"" in the leaves of the tree. Usually if a baby bird fell, I would stick it into that cubby, it was dark like a nest or cave and the baby would run back into the back of it, where cats wouldn't get it at least. And usually I would see adults hanging out in the tree next to it like they were watching, so I hope that I helped them by putting the baby in a spot where the parents could reach it still. Also had a baby hawk fall from its nest too early and the parents were flying over nad perching on wires, all they could do was watch him and hope he'd learn to fly soon. Sadly he had heatstroke and some smoke inhalation from nearby fires, which is probably why he jumped from the nest early out of desperation. We took him to a wildlife center for rescue but they called and said he died, he was just too sick, the poor thing. But even after that the parents flew around for a while, looking for him :( so they definitely don't abandon them, I'm glad more people are correcting that myth."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"People don't know much but sparrows and certain specias of little birds controls pests and while traveling with the seeds helps the nature. Good job keeping the cycle and taking care of nature nowadays we need people that understands the equilibrium and how we need each other, can be insects, mammals, birds, even a predator like a lynch or a fox, we all need each other even the little species around us that we can't see at naked eye."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Can we appreciate her cake factory!
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Most birds imprint on the first person or bird that takes care of them.  SO üòçüòäüòö

15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Only thing I suggest is to remove the abalone shell from the enclosure. The inside of the shell is poisonous. Don't ever cut, grind, or sand the shell as the is dust is highly toxic."
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Okay wait, so what happened in thee end?? Did the bird leave to go live in the woods all on its own or did it return to her and decided to stay and be taken care of ??"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,CUTE!
15,13ZpupaiVGw,"Ahhhh, puro amooor"
15,13ZpupaiVGw,Does anyone know that the name of that little bird sounds alot like the name of the pterodactyl from the land before time who's name was Petrie.

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Omg they are too cute honestly how could you not just keep them all ‚ù§
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"JOEY PLEASE READ!!!! If you allow the mom to wean them on her own, she won't have to deal with engorged nipples. That is not good for mom!!!! She will slowly let the pups nurse less and less. And you, feed them food. Which means they nurse less and less. And mom will regurgitate food for the pups, which is the NATURAL WAY!!! And their tummies can handle the new introduction to solid foods a lot better. It is the natural way of things. It helps pups and helps mom. And, they get disciplined by mom in the process. Which makes for a much better dog. Having human interaction is important. And learning how to interact with another dog, through moms discipline, helps them learn as well. PLEASE DO IT THIS WAY FROM NOW ON!! PLEASE! Mom and pups benefit so much from the natural process. And, makes it easier for you, because  she will attend to them a bit longer."
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Joey's baby-talk voice that he uses when he talks to baby animals is the REASON I watch these lol It is seriously so comforting and also funny. Keep it doing it Joey!
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"Very well done! These pups are learning to use the litter box. Monty's pups are gigantic.  I am so glad Michah got adopted and I am glad he is going to a place where he will have siblings. Monty looks so pretty with those bows on. Wolfe so handsome.  He doesn't look big to me he looks muscular. I am glad Monty is going with Daniel, maybe now she can get some rest. Eleven pups is a lot of work to keep track of. Let's see how the boys handle a bunch of mini Montys! : )"

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Yeah for Michah's adoption! Weaning looks so difficult but I'm sure she's actually grateful considering it was so painful to even do it.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I love watching these puppies they're my favorite batch of pups
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Oh no! She could get mastitis weaning them like that. You should start by taking away one feeding at a time slowly so her body can adapt and start producing less milk. Being engorged hurts üò¢. I know you‚Äôre doing ur best just a tip from a breeder.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I love the puppy updates ! They‚Äôre getting so big so fast ! ü•∫üíû
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"I'm so happy that Micah is at his forever home and he has playmates. OMG! You forgot to say Good Damn Bye at the end lol. I never get tired of watching the update on the puppies. Well done on the litter box training. Wolfie and Monty looked handsome and beautiful after being groomed. Monty deserves the much needed rest from feeding the puppies. They really took to the fake milk, glad you added the puppy kibble to it as well. Daniel and you are the best dog dads. Much üíñ from üá®üá¶"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"With how many rescues and in-crisis animals that Joey helps, I wish very much that he would talk more about the importance of spay/neuter."

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Not Daniel calling Joey ‚Äúbabe‚Äù when mixing the formula don‚Äôt want to be that person but really hope they can rekindle back together in the future would be my Christmas wish they was deffo the power couple when I was younger and can definitely be that again easily‚Ä¶ üëèüèºüíñ

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Y‚Äôall or Daniel should get two of those food bowls. That way there‚Äôs enough for all of them and they‚Äôll all get to eat at the same time.

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Oh the puppy smutzy drinking sounds!! üòç
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Hey Joey I love you the puppies are so adorable ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,You‚Äôre gonna need some bigger litter boxes and a bigger area for them to hang out in! There are so many of them!
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"Petition for Saskia to have a friend! ü•∞ Cats are social animals and Saskia would greatly benefit from having another cat around. 
Another cat would have far more benefits than any of the animals would get from another dog‚Ä¶.but I know Joey is going to go through with it either way though, as his mind is set on it. 
It‚Äôs just, when Joey says that he can‚Äôt handle another cat /because/ he wants a puppy instead‚Ä¶.it breaks my heart a little. The puppies are gorgeous and would have 0 issues finding the perfect home. Having animals means finding a balance and doing what‚Äôs best for them, rather than just best for yourself. Please think about this Joey ‚ù§ 
All love, no hate.
Hopefully I didn‚Äôt come off as rude in any way, I tried to word it as best I could üòÖ It‚Äôs coming from a place of caring deeply about animals, especially cats because they‚Äôre so misunderstood by a lot of people."
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"Moon is such a good, sweet and gentle dog!"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Awww I'm so glad Mica got to go to a home with other siblings <3 I adopted my cat and the foster didn't seem to be aware he was bonded and I didn't find out until 5 months later when he was super eager to play with the neighbour's cat.  I live in an apartment so I can't adopt another cat for him but he has play dates with the neighbour <3 they love each other <3
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"So heart-warming, thank you! üíù"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I always used the big plastic trays you can get at the farm supply store with the pellets. They are easier for the pups to get in and out of. The trays are made for the bottom of rabbit cages.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,That‚Äôs awesome Idea! I‚Äôm so happy he got home congratulations on your new home little guy!

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"micah is such a good boy and a well mannered kitten, a lot of kittens r energetic and not easy to cuddle with. glad he finally found his forever home ü•π"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"I am no dog expert. Actually,  l never owned one. But,  l do agree on letting mom wheen her puppies.  You see how quickly she got better over night. And she was eager to feed them. Maybe  splitting them up to 4 or 5 at a time, to feed, because,  l'm sure that they are alot stronger now. I hope that you get to read this and the dog experts advice, too. Good job anyways, Joey."
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Finally the last kitten got adopted
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"I keep imagining the puppies as adult Goldens wanting to use litter boxes instead of going outside. The rule for cats is that you're supposed to have one litter box for each cat plus an extra, so you're going to need like 10 more litter boxes. ü§£"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Those are happy tails!
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"The Moms should be the ones who decides when to ween.  She had not done that yet.  Those very full teats are very painful - it's normal to do both food and let her nurse for a couple of weeks.... the milk doesn't just ""turn off"" guys."
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I‚Äôm so happy that Micah got a new family ‚ù§ sad to him him go

15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I think that Moon has only got one treat out of the Advent calendar I think that he deserves more treats poor Moon
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I'm so happy Moon finally got a treat took 4 days but at least it's finally his turn yaaay Moon
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,BABE. I heard it. They‚Äôre gonna get back together. C‚Äômon. Just do it.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"We‚Äôre getting a little golden retriever puppy in early January, our little ivy was born in the same week as your puppies and it‚Äôs amazing being able to see them growing up ‚ù§Ô∏è Golden Retrievers all round!!!"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Milk engorgement is very painful.  A mother dog weans them slowly so her milk supply is less each day.  The puppies should be fed their food first and still allowed to nurse some so her milk can dry up naturally.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Im so glad u post these. My little brother gets cheered up by them. ‚ô°
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,My dog LOVES watching these vlogs üòçüòç
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Love your videos joey graceffa!!
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I never thought of that joey‚ù§ it‚Äôs so cute and I love your dogs and cats even more than others because I CANT get a pet cus my siblings are allergic üò¢
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Monty has had 3 treats and Moon has had 1‚Ä¶this just isn‚Äôt right
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"When cats give you love it's an honor because they're very picky. A stray black kitten showed up we ended up adopting him, he's always been skittish around most people but he climbs up on me and hides his head under my arm sometimes. Plus he purrs on me so much I feel like it's a major healing thing! He's made my life so happy!"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,I love how many people immediately tuned in to watch puppies poop üòÜ
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,The fact that these puppies are using a LITTER BOX is INCREDABLE!!!

*Montana/Monty (female golden retriever) is often in videos; she is Daniel's (Joey's ex) dog, but often comes to Joey doggy daycare
*the babies are usually adopted by other people (other than Moon) and then renamed! some of them have instagrams and have shared their new names/stories, but I'm not including those here
*I first created this list a long time ago and add to it every time Joey takes in a new animal...because I have it saved I just copy/paste it onto every (I try, but it's more like ""most"") animal-related video he posts, so no, it actually doesn't take a lot of my time or effort. I just like lists. Thank you to everyone who is giving thanks about the amount of effort though haha!"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Y‚Äôall know we owe all these Joey vlogs to Mr. Preda right ?!?!?
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,New kitty owners are lovely :)
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Awwww poor moony I know Monty is a mommy but moony deserves more treats too he had only 1 and Monty had 3
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Doesn‚Äôt weaning mean gradually? Poor Monty must hurt so bad. Please alleviate  her! Not sure if the vlog is multiple days but one day seems really harsh.
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,The puppies are even cute when they are pooping!
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Moon was so GENTLE! ü•∞
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"So cute! But I think the audio is missing? Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit: Sound has returned üòäüòä"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,"Joey, thanks for uploading your vlog of this video, thanks to your puppies and your ex-boyfriend, Daniel!!"
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,POV: your a bird owner and you just love watching dog videos to make you laugh and of a sudden you spot your fav YouTuber making a video of golden retriever using a litter is concerning
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,did anyone else hear joey call daniel ‚Äúbabe‚Äù ??
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,Everyone should get a treat even if it‚Äôs not from the calendar
15,TrQFHgDZOyQ,He said babe!!!! Are they back together?! I hope so
15,HDnrHjCL258,The one thing I learned from this: groundhogs are the real gangsters ü§ò
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Poor squirrels developed a banana habit quickly. They can regale their grandchildren about the time in the woods when an exotic fruit appeared, how delicious it was, and how they wait and hope  . . ."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"That light colored raccoon is pretty cool, I think it could be a blonde raccoon which is pretty rare. Love the vids keep up the great work btw"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Yes, I enjoyed this very much. The deer are so beautiful. I love your narration as well."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"It‚Äôs interesting how different animals interact with each other. But if you think about it, it would definitely be weird to go to the buffet and be sitting one table over from a family of horses üòÜ"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Enjoyed seeing the Fawns and the Squirrels and Groundhog interaction. Even though Raccoons are fierce fighters they avoid conflict when possible as we see here! Wonderful video capture! Have a great day, Char üòäü¶å‚òÄÔ∏èü¶ùüëç"
15,HDnrHjCL258,I think you are correct.  These animals had no idea what to think about the bananas at first.   Plus they get way sweeter as they get ripe.  I love watching these videos.   To see how these wild animals react to the foods you put out for them.   Even watching crabs & fish eat bait you set out.   Thanks for another awesome video.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"these videos are always so entertaining! I'm interested in a video about what food scraps and discards wild animals will eat, both from your household and dumpster diving"
15,HDnrHjCL258,The little deer family is so sweet it brings tears to my eyes. Thankyou for the lovely images. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love these videos and aces interpretations of the animals thoughts
15,HDnrHjCL258,This is so cool!  I love these videos. My Dad has a trail cam out. He buys apples and corn and puts it out almost every night. I always think it's neat to see all the animals that come through overnight.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Thanks for sharing. So fun to watch all these beautiful animals enjoy the goodies you put out for them. I used to do this before the area I live in got over run by a mall and an apartment complex the size of a small city. I didn't have squirrels but I had Deer, Coyotes, Javalinas, Badgers, Foxes, Bats, Armadillos, Racoons, and last but not least the good old Opossums and, oh yes, all kinds of birds. Sometimes progress is hard to live with. Please keep sharing your videos. I most especially liked the peanut butter video. And MERRY CHRISTMAS."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"This is soooooo nice too watch. With all the BS going on in life, and I being from upstate NY, now living in AZ, were there is NO animals as such, my mind is peacfull. THANK YOU!!!! Keep up the vids my brother!!!"
15,HDnrHjCL258,Thank you for doing this. This is the first time I‚Äôve seen your channel and I loved it. You have a new subscriber!  ‚úå‚ù§
15,HDnrHjCL258,I think they were reluctant to go near the bananas at first because bees release a fearsome that smells like bananas when they‚Äôre stressed and they could be scared of that.
15,HDnrHjCL258,I totally enjoy these and your voice overs topping on the cake. Well done!
15,HDnrHjCL258,Ace great job bud. I would  like to see you and your dad on a week trip in the woods doing a a shelter build and  fish and hunt. Like a survival  but with some gear.  Maybe something for the summer.  Could also be a fish and hunt on a island. Alittle different content for you but give also  variety.  Just and idea. Have a  blessed day!!
15,HDnrHjCL258,We love your videos!!!  Thanks for making us laugh!!!
15,HDnrHjCL258,The creatures of the woods have been starving without your videos. Thank you for posting!
15,HDnrHjCL258,I would love to see if any animals would take interest in something like  grapes or cantaloupe and kiwis. I'm honestly curious ü§î
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love these videos!  I need to try this on my property!!!
15,HDnrHjCL258,My kids will be so excited with this new upload! I'm gonna wait to watch it with them.
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love Nature! Calming for the soul from all the chaos out here. Thank you...Cheers!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"I love these so much!  All those species figured out how to get their share. But of course humans,  well.  . ."
15,HDnrHjCL258,I think they're getting slightly drunk off the fermented bananas. Squirrels are notorious for that.üòÇ
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Very cool variety of animals you attracted, keep up the awesome work üôÇ but taking off the plastic stickers from the bananas might be a little idea for improvement for the next trail cam video"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"I put out bananas a lot at my house for the crows and squirrels. Whenever I don't partially peel the banana it'll sit for a day or 2.

But when I break the peel it's always gone by the morning.

I'd assume they can smell through the peel, but that's just my experience over 2 years."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Im surprised that a huge pile of fruit didn't bring more animals ü§Øü§Ø
15,HDnrHjCL258,"New subscriber. Your video was on my suggested video list. I really enjoyed watching and listening to your hypothesis for the squirrels liking bananas. I wonder if they could taste the higher level of sugars. Thanks for the video!
üççüòéü§ôüå¥ü••üå∫üåà‚òÉÔ∏è"
15,HDnrHjCL258,This channel is a piece of beautiful animal heaven all the lovely animals! ‚ù§
15,HDnrHjCL258,I was renting a room in a friend's house and he has a big apple tree in front of the house. The apples fell since no one was interested in them. The snow came and then the birds like you would not believe. Those apples turned out to be the only thing that saved those birds that winter.
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love this series so much!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Your videos are very interesting but wild animals make food choices based on more than just taste- there are ways for them to evaluate which is worth more calorie rich, so bananas have more calories per bite than an apple (Foraging theory). They were choosing the more calorie heavy bananas, which made sense when offered a choice. And BTW, you are doing science! Asking questions and getting data. Keep taking cool videos."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Manners are important in the wild! Think about how easily an animal could get a nasty infection from the smallest cut - even if they win the fight that gave them it. Most of the time, they really do not want to fight unless they have to. I can't get enough of videos like these, I don't know what it is but watching animals get the most insane snack of their lives is just joy üòÇ"
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love the different types of music you give to different animals
15,HDnrHjCL258,I really love your videos ace you have a lot of bananas see you soon!! Take care always!!!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"You should spread the  food further apart, because the two smells may confuse them. Animals can smell things from great desistance's, so these two smells together may be overpowering!"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Watched a previous video on feeding critters salted peanuts which are not good because of high sodium content.  Raw peanuts might seem healthier but are also bad, especially for squirrels, as they interfere with the intestines ability to absorb protein. Raw peanuts are  also frequently infected with a fungal toxin which can damage the liver.  I feed the squirrels unsalted dry-roasted peanuts which are safer and put big smiles on their little rodent faces."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Cute ü•∞ deers ü¶åall the animals are adorable üòä sweet feeding them
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love this series!
15,HDnrHjCL258,The 2nd raccoon I believe is a female. Male raccoons are about 25% bigger(10-20 pounds heavier)and have wider faces. Kits(baby raccoons)separate from the mom around 12-14 mos old to start their own life. If you see a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù it is almost always the mother with her kits. Single mom life/absent father.The father doesn‚Äôt play a role in raising the kits.
15,HDnrHjCL258,Btw the reason why many animals are very shy and afraid to come closer is because they can smell human odor near it. üòÉ
15,HDnrHjCL258,Groundhogs are actually quite aggressive. They have large buck teeth which can take a chunk out of something‚Äôs skin if they are threatened
15,HDnrHjCL258,Hey I‚Äôm a big fan. I love watching your videos especially since you pray before eating. I love getting seafood and eating at the same time. I hope you have a blessed day. From Houston
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Commercial bananas are treated with a gas that some people (like me) are allergic to. The animals might be sensitive to the scent. Once the bananas decayed so did the gas, and also attracted bugs.
The animals are going for the bugs on the bananas. 
The apples arent treates with that gas and their scent is sweet to the animals.
Once they were attracted to the sweet scent of the apples they came up and found the bugs and worms in the bananas, a good portion of protein like that isn't that easy to come by for such animals."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love these! üòä
15,HDnrHjCL258,Haha them chucks are tough. They look cute and cuddly but I  bet they'd beat a raccoon in a race and are much stronger too. Was definitely cool to watch!
15,HDnrHjCL258,I don‚Äôt think the reason the raccoons didn‚Äôt come first because they didn‚Äôt recognize the banana smell. Mostly because raccoons are opportunistic and eat pretty much anything they can find. They‚Äôre even called ‚ÄúTrash Panda‚Äù so I‚Äôm sure they eat things they‚Äôre not familiar with every day. Idk it‚Äôs a mystery why they took so long to discover it.
15,HDnrHjCL258,Great video! My squirrels didn't want the bananas. I will put them out a second time.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Hey Ace, I love the lobster/crab catch and cooks"
15,HDnrHjCL258,I thought it was cool how the 2 deers were cleaning each other!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Bananas get sweeter the older they are, apples will ferment and get them drunk. Drunk squirrels are hilarious."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"It is no wonder that the animals preferred the banannas once they got a taste for them. Banannas are a lot more energy dense than appels (about 2-3 times the calories) so eating them are ""worth"" a lot more for the animals than eating the appels."
15,HDnrHjCL258,"ah, the Blonde Racoon. i've only seen it, in person at that! once. in my whole 40 years of existence. pretty cool catch."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love this series ü§ô
15,HDnrHjCL258,I would have thought the groundhog would have ate the apples over the bananas. Surprised the deer didn't get on the apples immediately. Cool video.
15,HDnrHjCL258,I came upon a woodchuck on a trail one day. It had a couple little ones with it. It made some fearsome noises and ran right at me and I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I backed off real quick.
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love the videos. I have a deer cam set up in the yard. I know there are deer here but we do not see them. At night they show up. I do not feed them. There is something in the grass that they like. I guess if I move the snow off some the grass and then they might come back. Thanks form north west Wisconsin.üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love these videos brother!
15,HDnrHjCL258,Do more exotic fruits like coconut or grapefruit would be cool
15,HDnrHjCL258,Just a theory but wild animals love to get drunk on fermented fruits they find in the wild such as apples lol. Maybe the same fermentation process happened to the bananas and they were all getting drunk on the bananas but had to wait until they fermented
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love these videos!
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love your videos! Maybe you might put out some honey or honeycomb and see who shows up?
15,HDnrHjCL258,"That was so cool
 thanks for sharing!"
15,HDnrHjCL258,Hey ace thank u for the lors  I‚Äôm going to use them next time I‚Äôm off work
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Imagine the apples and bananas, ferment enough and it gets a little squirrel drunküòÇüòÇüòÇ"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"During the recent drought , a doe approached me and I rolled an apple toward her. Instead of spooking away , she charged that apple and ate it in 3 bites!"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"The sugar content of bananas increases as ripening advances. The yellow brown spotted stage, considered by some to be rotten, is what we best like eating. The next stage, over 50% brown spotted, are fruit salad or banana cake bananas, obviously still quite edible. Clearly, animals think so too. Some monkeys take them at any stage! Col, NZ"
15,HDnrHjCL258,That machete on Apple action was impressive! üëè
15,HDnrHjCL258,"You win the Internet today!  Very interesting vid of a mixture of critters trying bananas for the first time and some apples.  The two fawns nuzzling each other was the ""awww"" moment of the day!  For a groundhog who has his own YouTube Channel see Chunk the Groundhog!  Quite the show at a farm in Delaware.  https://www.youtube.com/@ChunkTheGroundhog"
15,HDnrHjCL258,Thanks for uploading another trail cam!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Animals are very sensitive to chemicals, perhaps you could put out some organic food and conventional food and see what happens. Thank you for sharing."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Thank you. I will add apples to my deer baiting.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Thanks for narrating the video! I enjoyed it.
Your blind subscriber."
15,HDnrHjCL258,I'm thinking as the fruit ripens/rots it gets smellier and sweeter
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Understandable why few animals came to eat them. Bananas aren't native to the mainland US, so for most of the forest animals, they don't even know what it is let alone if it's edible."
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love your content üòÇ
15,HDnrHjCL258,Maybe the bananas fermented over a few days and they just wanted to get a little tippy
15,HDnrHjCL258,"I never gave one of my horses apples or carrots when he was younger so now at 14 he won't touch them
 Put a piece of apple on top of his grain. No way. Grain is eaten apple still in feed box His father had an apple tree in his field and he loved apples and ate probably way too many."
15,HDnrHjCL258,I love these videos üòÜüòÜ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§åü§å
15,HDnrHjCL258,I think they have a supermarket smell and taste unless you got them organic. You should try this same thing but with organic fruit!!!!!
15,HDnrHjCL258,Pumpkins! The seeds help with worms. Great video!
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Hey Critter watchers, Did you know, the Groundhog is the largest member of the squirrel family ?
The Squirrels are asking ""Hey wheres our day"" ?"
15,HDnrHjCL258,Love these vids
15,HDnrHjCL258,Trail cameras shouldn‚Äôt glitch if an animal comes into sight. Don‚Äôt know who told you that was normal. And also it‚Äôs pretty common to see birds and squirrels together. Also deer and raccoons will eat together
15,HDnrHjCL258,Rock chucks are yellow-bellied marmots. Wood chucks are groundhogs.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Do rabies not exist in the wild?  I feed feral cats, and also raccoons,  I keep the food and water separate and not out at the same time.  I have been told and have also read so many times that raccoons are carriers of rabies and would not want the cats getting it.  Is this something to not worry about?  Also, the raccoons love grapes, but bananas and apples they did not bother with.  So no more bananas or apples from me."
15,HDnrHjCL258,I used to live near open space and the deer loved my apple trees
15,HDnrHjCL258,Groundhogs are very territorial and will even go after people if they feel threatened.
15,HDnrHjCL258,I feed birds and ants.  Interests me the differences of what they eat among the same species let alone separate species.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Ace, how about on the next video you put out a large mirror. Let‚Äôs see how the animals react to their own image."
15,HDnrHjCL258,Enjoy these videos would like to see you come back to idaho and do one
15,HDnrHjCL258,The longer the fruit sits as it decays it gets sweeter
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Bananas get very sweet and aromatic when they blacken,I love them that way,I don't blame the animals at all"
15,HDnrHjCL258,Lovely video. Thank you for your time.
15,HDnrHjCL258,"The sugar content of the bananas makes them irresistable I guess. Especially as the ripen, the sugar levels go up"
15,HDnrHjCL258,I feel like maybe the bananas have a sweeter smell as they get older? Or they taste better? Plus I don't think they can smell the bananas too much while they're still pilled maybe idk
15,HDnrHjCL258,I‚Äôm guessing that there are no wild hogs in the area because they would have wiped out all of the fruit
15,HDnrHjCL258,"Oh you got a blonde raccoon on camera nice!
You‚Äôve created a bunch of banana addicts now lol"
15,HDnrHjCL258,"If you leave banana, specifically, to deteriorate in the outdoors then after sufficient time that turns into the very close equivalent of poop. No kidding. It basically becomes turd. As for what does scavenge on bananas before it totally deteriorates is another thing. That would depend."
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Leave a like if we should do a part 2 at this crazy sewer!üî•
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Geez you're so brave going in there lmao. I wouldn't dare.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"As someone who just spent the last month watching EVERY SINGLE video on this channel, from the first video (as far back as it goes at least) to this video, I have to say this is by far the best video dropped so far and there‚Äôs been some good ones! Also, I‚Äôve been wanting to say for a week or so now Rob has been the best addition/side kick to grace this channel. Finally the leaps and strides in production and content since the beginning has been phenomenal! Awesome job and channel! Quality Content."
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"I had a breeding pair of dwarf snakeheads once, and when they had babies, the female would stare me down whenever I was in the room, and if I got too close to the tank she would flare up and ram against the glass. They are very territorial animals, and will fight anyone who gets too close haha. 
I love them, they are incredible animals :)"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,You guys are so crazy!  Almost every episode I am anticipating an alligator attack! üôÇ
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,You‚Äôre getting better at catching crawfish Bobby
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Wish I had this, should definitely get more underwater footageüî•"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,My word your best yet! Can't wait for a part 2! You & Rob are killing it! Hype!!!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Oh Bobby, you never disappoint!  Great video - I love your screaming, lol. And Rob is a great addition with his enthusiasm and teasing . That snakehead was insane :)"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I‚Äôm so so happy that you set up a legit breeding tank for them cause i always wonder about them after you catch them and would like to see them grow and breed!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Would love a part 2 of the scary sewer!  Watch out for the gators!  <shivers!> Wow, I'd love a couple blue crawfish!   My son caught one once, not a blue, and not in Florida, but here in northern NY.  We kept him in an aquarium for a long time.  He was so cool!  I wish we could find a blue here, but probably not huh.  I wonder if you can buy one on the internet.  Anyhow, cool blue crawfish breeding pond set up.  Hope to see babies sometime, for you."
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Excellent video yet again Bobby, well done for braving the sewer tunneling üòÆ üí™üèª, great blue crawfish yield üëçüèª,  keep it up, looking forward to your h next adventures üòä"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,You know you‚Äôre putting out good content when other YouTubers literally copy your vlogs. Especially when they have close to a hundred thousand more subscribers than you. Keep working Bobbie.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Someone walking down the road and hear all those girly screaming coming from the sewer! Lol love ya Bobby! Rob gives you confidence! You two are great together!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Great video Bobby and Rod. That was wild man. Thank you for sharing. God bless you both and both your families...üôè‚ù§üôè‚ù§üôèüòäüôÇüòÄ
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Awesome video. Keep up the amazing work. I love watching your videos
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"I hope to see part tow!!!
love your videos and love all your cool fish
and I love how you would go in a dumpster to save fish!
but why go at night?"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"An amazing catch, Bobby, and what a massive Snakehead! Yes, for Part 2 please!"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,LOL I thought the snake head at first was definitely an alligator had me worried for a second but as far as that crawfish aquarium you should have some type of lid they can easily crawl out this was certainly fun to watch makes me want to visit Florida
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Freaking Amazing job with this one really outdid yourself with the idea for this vid
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Wow I thought it was a gator I was shaking so bad when it charged at you guys thank god it was a snakehead. Those blue crawfish are so cute and love the pond you done for them great job guys
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Really great video mate keep it up sorry i have was busy since few day haven't seen recent videos but I will go back and watch them all and leave a like ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Your work is great guys keep it up 
Love from India ‚ù£Ô∏è"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"""Baby gator show yourself"" ""no. Dont show yourself!""

That just really gets me üòÇ"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"That snakehead had to have lived most of its life in that tunnel, he‚Äôs not near as dark as all the other ones y‚Äôall catch normally"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"i wanna see multiple traps, some outside the tunnel for the crawfish, some inside the tunnel for the exotics, do a catch and cook on the snake head if u catch it again, catch and cooks would be cool"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I noticed in his opening monologue that he just took a step in the evolution as a entertainer and content creator.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Also great addition to the breeding tank for the blue crawfish
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I literally thought the snakehead fish was a Junior youth alligator üêä but the sound differently sounded like a junior alligator or toad frog üê∏ in the tunnel glad both of you made it out safe and sound stay safe while catching crawfish ü¶û/fish out in the wild Florida known of wildlife always good to stay alert of your surroundings üòáüôè
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Awesome video!!(no surprise lol)

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"I love these videos and because of them I did some research and found that in Ohio where I live, I can catch Darters and Hillstream loaches! Thanks for the vids."
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,OMG. Grandma here is dying laughing at the screaming. I love you guys!!!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"do a part 2 please, but also... give us updates on the blue crawfish breeding pond!"

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Very cool video! Please be careful at night ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,The pond you have for the crawfish would be perfect to keep multiple bettas in. Plenty of space and but some floating plants in to give cover and they will start blowing bubble nest hopefully and then you can have babies.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Once again  awesome content guys  you two are fun to watch üëçüëç Bfp Nation ü§ü
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,11:51 üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ thank you Bobby for having me on tears üòÖ you guys are insane and what a haul of lil blue‚Äôs ü¶ûEPIC !!! üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üî•üòéü§ôüèº

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I never seen someone soo excited to catch crawfish haha the blue crawfish are soo pretty. Im glad your trying to give these rare crawfish a chance to make more babies.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"That snakehead is like, yo, wtf are you doing in my sewer, this is my sewer not yours!  üòÖ(I know they should be culled but I'm glad you set him free.  The fish are obviously doing fine with him there"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"I love u man, u make my days so much better.

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Hi those fish are crazy keep up the good work
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,This is the best video you have done. I first thought alligator was after you. Snakehead was huge but I truly needed a laugh.

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I already know I‚Äôm going to like this you always make great content
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Amazing video. You HAVE to load that place with fish traps. 
Didn't Bobbly have a white crawfish in a tank?"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"So very cool,I've never seen anyone,go after the blue crayfish like you guys,I didn't even know they were a legitimate breed,I always thought it was like finding an albino so good for you guys"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Call you too you left my heart pounding I was scared right along with you please do some more blue Crawford they are so much fun to watch and I hope you get some orange and more white ones in there thanks again this is Melody from Wichita Kansas

15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Huge Snakehead !!!! Love the blue crayfish !
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,OMG that Snakehead at first sight looked like something from a horror movie then the gator in the tunnel at the end you guys are amazing and you go out of your way to do amazing videos and you deserve a lot more subs than you currently have. Keep up the good content. Keep being amazing. Thanks for keeping my head up.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I gotta say - I think Rob is my favorite camera man/co-host
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"When Booby said ""We're going in"" I was waiting for Rob to say ""We? You got a mouse in your pocket?"""
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Not a big time commenter but easily the best video you've put up since I subbed a few months ago. Having Rob on hand now is definitely a legit content boost, dude has personality for days! Keep it up, Bobby!"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"12:49 that part was funnyüòÇ üòÜ I thought it was a catfish, but bro for real try be careful there can be alligators and you guys can get really hurt by those things üò¨."
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Love your vids and you guys need some safety gear man! I keep expecting y‚Äôall to lose a leg or get some infected cuts üòÆ
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Absolutely the coolest video by far
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Screams r my favorite part dont ever stop. U r so fun to watch love this channel!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Best video ever thanks for great entertainment üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüá¶üá∫
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,You should try finding white crayfish too. They are pretty rare as well. It'll also be cool if regular colored crayfish appeared due to breeding. The gene pool is pretty crazy.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Don't be so hard on the gator, he was just inviting you for dinner. üòÅ"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"I love it but, I want to see a part 2!"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,great video love the content and the channel
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Bobby is the best fishing YouTuber am I right
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,But I'd love to have some of those cichlids...
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,DUDE! Once they start breeding you should do a blue crawfish giveaway!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"This video had everything a good movie needs it had drama, comedy, HORROR and plot twists like you'd never believe lmao 10/10 highly recommend"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,This content is sick. Love this. Go deeper üòÜ
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"You guys are crazy! Yet, I want to join you! lol"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Great video! So funny and exciting.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I seriously thought it was a gatorüòÇ almost got a heart attack and turns out to be the fish
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Hopefully you eventually catch a white crawfish or orange one again to add to the project
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,PLEASE do part 2!!!!!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"Haha this was great bro. Loved all the screams and everything,"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,be real careful I justo work in Florida utilities with the sewers and sometimes them holes got lost bad air gases that can kill you in seconds dude be careful were you go in to
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I salute u for give us content pretty much nobody else will
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Most chaotic video yet.  That snakehead got me shocked. That was GIGANTIC.   I vote you guys do this again but during the day time.  Might catch some other species that like to hide during the day
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,24hr fish trap in the deep sections would be crazy I think
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,"When you micro fish, use an ice fishing rod but do it in the tunnel"
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Bobby are you really never gonna go back to the abandoned pet store?
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Yes more night crayfish video!!!
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,I have 1 blue crawfish in my aquarium but he's not electric love your videos I am german and there are insane your videos are a legend! Pls dont stop
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,You need to toss a fish trap in that square hold in the door in the tunnel.
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,üòÇüòÇüòÇ I honestly thought a gator had you then! Lol
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Hey Bobby. When I was a kid we would tie string to a piece of liver or bacon and catch hundreds of crawdads in the creek behind my house. Would be an easy catch buddy. Good luck
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Any weird fish u find u should put in the crayfish tub just make sure it stays small so u don't have to move it
15,XH6pjKmqQoQ,Another awesome video bro!!!
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,You know that a man truly loves life when he takes a timeout during his day to save a mouse.
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,"Mouse: *""Died""*

This guy: _""No, I don't think you did.""_"
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,The mouse's family was probably worried. I hope the poor thing makes it back home in time for supper.
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,You know he‚Äôs a nice guy who enjoys life when he takes his time just for this mouse
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,Empathy for other living things is wonderful!

15,uWEDMZSSUOk,This man is such a kind nice guy. I appreciate him loving nature
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,imagine while he's talking about nature a bird just swoops in and takes the mouse away
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,Only true heroes would spend their whole day on a mouse
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,My mouse just died and I‚Äôve been sitting in my car trying to revive him

15,uWEDMZSSUOk,Great job man thank you for your love of nature
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,There‚Äôs an awesome example of what a real man is right here.  Real men don‚Äôt go around killing animals or beat them to death.  Real men and real women are kind towards everyone especially animals.

15,uWEDMZSSUOk,His or her heart was beating the whole time I saw it at first

I love people like this - they make this world a beautiful place!!"
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,This is just too wholesome ü•∫üòáüò≠üò≠üò¢
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,"Rats make some of the best pets. The ones I had were female fancy rats and there was never a hint of aggressive behavior towards the family. They'd attack strangers who tried to put their fingers into the cage. Very intelligent, loyal and sociable. I'd have a rat now for sure the only problem is the fact that they have such a short lifespan that broke my heart to see them pass away after 3-4 years."
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,"I can tell in this man's voice, all life is special to him. Cheers, mate"
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,"I work will mice and when the mouse stops and looks at you, you know he's calmed down and realized you're not a predator since you haven't ate him. He understood that you weren't gonna eat him, and felt comfortable enough to stay a little longer."

15,uWEDMZSSUOk,We need more humans like this
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,so heart warming
15,uWEDMZSSUOk,This guy is a real hero. Politicians talk about nature and don‚Äôt do anything only lies and deception.  This guy brought hope in mankind!

15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Luke's off-the cuff humor can lighten up the darkest room:
""Roscoe is misinterpreted by humans; when visitors come to the Farm 
they bring two pairs of undies!"""
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"The pack has a HUGE effect on shelter dogs!! I've been watching 2 years, and I'm still amazed how quickly the shelter dogs improve, and their joy!! They are happy because they can just be a dog, plus have overwhelming üíïü•∞üëãüèºüéØ"

15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Luke and Sam, I know what you mean about the vocalisation issue and the size with Rosco, and how it can be misconstrued. I had a Rottweiler and he never barked he but would vocalise like Neveah does when she‚Äôs excited. And nearly every time he did it around other people they would get worried about him. But his body language was completely fluid, very wiggly, head was always low when approaching . But he would always vocalise. Because he was a big male people would always be fearful around him, but dogs knew immediately his body language, ear placement and the tone of his vocalising was non threatening. He would always lie down when meeting a small dog. Loved cats, I always thought if only these people could see him at home lying on his bed with a cat lying stretched out on top of him they wouldn‚Äôt be so wary. üêæ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ"

15,7zZJdukpsh4,"i watched more than one video regarding dogtraining. the main difference i noticed: other trainers dont allow the dogs to get attached. its business only. and sometimes i saw trainers who educated the dogs by istalling fear of punishment.

with you its completely different. you allow all the dogs to come close to you. you create an invironment where they can feel safe. i think this is important because i have the idea that some of these behavioural issus are coming from a place of fear. its not only your knowledge how to help them, its your heart you throw into the ring. for me this makes all the difference. they learn to trust and not to be afraid anymore. this allows them to let their guard down. you helped so many dogs to turn their behaviour around and find a new home. just remember yoyo, conrad, molly, luna and many more. all these successtories are prove that you do it right.

after losing both our dogs in october my husband and i now look at yet another bonded pair at the shelter. one big, one small. the big one is an interesting mix: rottweiler/big pyrenees. the small one is a west highland terrier. they are inseperable and came from a not so pleasant invironment. we go to the shelter every other day. take them out for walks to find out about their behaviour. it looks good so far and we dont want them to be seperated. so fingers crossed that we can bring them home for christmas."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I think Sam mentioning ""Behind the Scenes"" frequently during the general Youtube videos is genious  because it will titillate non members to join. Those mentions surely make those folks realize that they're missing something good. To non members...you are!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"My admiration for all your family can‚Äôt be overstated. Allowing us into your conversations, interactions with your family, and seeing you handle everyday life really enriches my life. Makes me feel included in family life.

15,7zZJdukpsh4,you might be only one person but for the pack you are are everything
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I must admit..I do look forward to these daily videos..
It's not only informative..but addicting!!.
I love to see how everyone is getting along & I just love seeing all the adorable pups!.
I got my Farm calendar & it's beautiful!. Love each month!ü•∞"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,The pack works so well because Luke knows exactly what's going on  with each one of them. I love these explanations. Such valuable lessons for all if us. Thank you so much Luke and Sam ü•∞ü•∞
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Great video. Really great info. Great to see Luna back for fun time at the Farm. Love the insight into the pack‚Äôs inner workings. And the mind set of Luke and what he wants to see the pack become.  Seriously how the heck is Chop Chop and Tank still there? How have they not been snapped up? They do have a couple of little things that need ironing out, but 100% ready to be in a forever home.üêæ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I was amazed how smart Rover was to act up so badly when he was taken back to the shelter.
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Notice Luke's calm demeanor ... even when confronted with common myths .... when a dog sizes you up they see that (and all dogs will size you up, it;s a survival instinct) ... I've trained large, powerful herding/guard dogs all my life (Bouvier des Flandres) and there are great difference in breed personalities/behaviors ... and I agree with Luke, the early years 8 mo's to 2 years old are critical in ""socializing"" (a broad term) to both people and other dogs .... the best advice I ever got was from my Grandfather who's family bred champion working Border Collies for over a decade ... he told me to learn to think more like a dog and less like a person ... to see the world from their perspective (as Luke says ""reading the dog"" ) ... I'm down to just one Bouv at 67 ... an intact 8 year old male, sweet boy with me and friends he knows (was raised with a laid back female Spinone) ... but he's never been good with other dogs ... he's edgy around them and it sets off other dogs easily ... he is what we call Belgians call an ""On Guarde"" dog ... part of the breed characteristics ... luckily he's well trained and easy to control for me ... but would be considered a ""problem dog"" for most, or not familiar with the breed ..."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Really appreciate your talks and your questions you ask Luke on our behalf Aunty Sam they really do answer all my questions. Thank you xx
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Dogs are as individual as people, getting to know them properly is key to understanding them. Unfortunately not every human who gets a dog is successful in this respect.  Some dogs lose out as a consequence. It is your great gift Luke that you take the time to understand and form constructive relationships with the dogs that come your way. What you and Sam and co are doing is wonderful. üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,How do you find time to get presents for the kids? Or each other? Or anyone? Online or in store? I  am so impressed that you get so much done. Love every video. üíì
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I definitely do not understand dog behavior, as I grew up with cats, but you trusted Roscoe a long time before I did.  Now I am feeling the same way about Chance.  I had a Cairn terrier who was feisty as heck but not a worry to me with regard to aggression and unpredictability.  Thank you for explaining things to novices like me.  Also, I think I remember that Gus was intact and he got along great with all the daycare dogs."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I would like to thank you both so much for your dedication to your viewers. You are so incredibly busy but still find the time to do videos. I've been having a very tough time recently, facing loosing family to cancer. But when I watch your videos it helps me to calm down and focus on something other than the sadness and the anxiety. It truly helps me get through my day. 
Thank you so much Luke, Sam and the pack."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"After all the wonderful things you've done for the shelter dogs, training, loving, caring plus, very expensive medical bills etc, I am surprised that they have not yet  been adopted...maybe adoptees think the dogs have it too good at your place like freedom, open spaces, lots of love and..good food. I would love to adopt Rover but I'm too far...(Canada). Wish you all and your doggies all the best and  Happy Holidays!!! Love you all!!! ‚ù§üéÑüéÑüéÑ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I love you talking about the dogs and their personalities! I have 2 questions that hopefully can be a talking point in the future Sam. Who grooms/brushes the dogs and who cuts their nails? Do you cut their nails on mass or separately. How do you desensitize them to nails being trimmed?
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"It's interesting for me to watch Luke try to explain how he assesses each dog as an individual.  I spent my professional life assessing human beings who struggled with psychiatric illness, intellectual disabilities and/or significant stress and I know that some people have a more inherent ability to assess than others.  Certainly training, reading and experience can help anyone develop assessment skills.  For those with more ""intuitive"" assessment skills, it can be difficult  to explain how you do it.  I respect Luke's struggle to explain his process - sometimes it's impossible, isn't it?  Nevertheless, I definitely learn from his attempts!  üòÅ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Among your many talents, Aunty Sam, is that of a skilled interviewer.  I know that you try to be very respectful of Luke's time because of all of the things already on his 'To Do' list.  The questions that you ask, whether they are of your own creation, or those from someone who submitted a comment, are well chosen and carefully thought out.  You ask them with a gentle precision to tease out the answers to questions that avid watchers, like myself, want to hear.  You are a keen observer in your own right and have an almost encyclopedic memory about each of the dogs in your care.  For his part, Luke is always very generous with his time and knowledge....always making clear that he speaks only for himself and his personal approach to assessing and training dogs.  You complement each other perfectly, and you each bring so many unique talents and abilities to everything you do.  Thank you for sharing so selflessly with those of us around the world who have nothing but complete respect and affection for you."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Don't try this at home Luke knows what he is doing ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Do you think Rover‚Äôs issues could be due to his medical condition and mixed hormone signals?
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I sit and watch so intensely then I giggle at myself because I catch myself nodding along with the conversations and laugh. love the 40ish minute videos, maybe this length would suit some people better than the longer videos and still fit the algorithm to be profitable. I‚Äôm happy to sit and watch for HOURS I can always pause and watch again when I have time. This week I‚Äôd be happy with a day long livestream coz I‚Äôm home sick with a lady flu but hubby‚Äôs away so furmum‚Äôs got ALL the duties, including clean up after the storms, it‚Äôs literally snowed leaves and covered the back yard (much like Luke and the pool vs leaves problem) lol. Ps can you use the lav mic that was recently sent so Luke can continue to work and chat & we don‚Äôt hold him up so much? Not sure of the range on it but at least you don‚Äôt need to be directly talking towards the phone/camera to hear when using it. Love what you do and love that you share it with all of us. #staypawsitive Michelle ‚ù§üêæ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"It‚Äôs good that Luke can work with so much supervision from the pack! I remember Winx‚Äôs video and her new family. They are such a nice couple and you could tell immediately that she was going to be spoiled. Of course that is supposed to happen. But, still perfect for her."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Sam & Luke  better do a head count before putting down the floor - there's some pups that look like they're comatose.  Lots of great information I didn't know and a lot of back stories that explain so much.  Thanks!
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Very interesting as usual. Make me think of things I hadn't heard before, especially about neutering. One thing you both may need to do. Just a suggestion. A couple of times, or more, a day, find a quiet corner, take a deep breath and let it out slowly.  You have a lot going on. Take that moment to regroup. lol."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I think it is wonderful what you two are doing! You have made many doglives much happier, thank you so much for this!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I enjoy every video, no matter what the topic, whatever the activity, I usually watch them at least twice.  I'm very interested in what this building will look likeüòé"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I adopted a dachshund from a rescue who was a ""triple reject"". I'm his 4th and final owner. He is not affectionate at all, and all my other dachshunds were hyper-affectionate, licky, lovie-dovies. When I love on him he growls at me, but when I stop he seems disappointed and looks at me like ""why'd you stop?"". When he plays he growls and it sounds exactly like his mad growl...it's so confusing. I've never met another dog like him."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"No staff? Not even Dylan? But he's ALWAYS there. I live for sightings of the secretive but precious Dylan. And no Auntie Chris? (Sorry, not sure how she spells her name). You're going to have to start training the dogs to work about the place. Make them earn their keep. I know for a FACT that Roscoe would be an excellent worker. That dog needs tasks. Likewise Joey. She's another 'desperate to work' dog. And if you could rein in Miss Violet's energy (maybe use her as a generator) she could surely do something useful about the place. Likewise Nevaeh, if you just disguise what she has to do as a toy. I think you guys maybe need to start considering volunteers? I'm sure you'd have many offers."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"You have the best environment for sheltered/rescued dogs.  As you mentioned, Rover and Luna are two good examples.  Rover did a complete turn-around being at The Farm and, if I remember correctly, Luna did the same.  Being contained is not what these dogs wanted, and I am happy you figured out what they needed.  Rosco's vocalization is wonderful.  I just get a thrill out of his voice. ‚ù§‚ù§   I would love to know what Rosco is telling you.  ‚ù§‚ù§   Thank you for this wonderful, enlightening video, Aunty Sam and Uncle Luke.  Well done, as always.  ‚ù§‚ù§üëçüëç"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"The cuddle mates starting at 12:00 are endearing. Roscoe and Maggie, Hope and one of the GSD girls, Freddo and Rover. Thanks for all the info and insights you're imparting. Explanation is always needed, why?, because our beautiful dogs can't talk!!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Enjoyed Rover swimming and finding a ramp.  He does watch what others do, reminds me some of Wolfie that way. Interesting that neutering can help avoid a social behavior problem forming."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,What effect does it have on a dog that lives in a shelter but is taken to a home for a play date or short term fostering. Is it an emotional letdown when the dog is returned to the shelter?
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Yes that‚Äôs a lot of time you put in when you take on the dogs who need isolation.

It‚Äôs funny watching cutie pie walk ahead of you Sam, her hips swing doing the lady walk lol"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love these Q & A videos! When Luke explains things it makes so much sense. I always thought my chihuahua mix was afraid of big dogs but she actually stands her ground then walks away and gives them a sharp bark to back off. Big dogs seem fascinated by her so she gets a lot of unwanted attention. She reminds me of Cutie Pie. Thank You for explaining intent, it was fascinating. üôè"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"A fascinating insightful video as always Sam and Luke. Your discussions are so interesting, enlightening and provide an abundance of experience and knowledge to us all. Thank you. Well done Rover, so happy to have witnessed your first swim, no stopping him now. A perfect end to a freezing Thursday. Love always xxüôãüíìüêæüå≤"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Wonderful informative discussion.  Learned a few things, smiled at the doggos,  i discovered something, I could watch the goings on of the dogs anytime, all the time.  It gives my soul a needed boost.  I think I need to get a lifeüòÜüòâ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I love your conversations and all of the information you impart. Each animal is so different from the next and your tailored approach is wonderful!
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love it when Luke dose the dog move lol, love it, thank you both xx"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Roscoe‚Äôs elegant high leap with a tuck of his rear before he hit the water‚Ä¶made me chortle with delight. I love the comment about being a rumbler. Roscoe‚Äôs baritone throat singing is a wonder. Thank you again.
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Such good information to put in the memory box üêæ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Sam, Luke thanks for all the extra information that you‚Äôre sharing. I think your ‚Äú tradies‚Äù are a little too keen on their breaks‚Ä¶ but I do love seeing Hope taking a nap right in the middle of the pack- good work guys you and your team have made so many people happy üíúüêæ sadly there‚Äôs no emoji for pugs"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Thanks for answering my question about the influence of your pack on a new-to-the-Farm shelter dog (e.g., River). Also appreciated your take on de-sexing. It was a perspective I hadn‚Äôt even thought of before. You really DO learn something new every day here! And I especially appreciate Luke‚Äôs emphasis that his training approaches with the dogs is NOT a one size fits all experience, but that there are many layers of observation that go into any behavioral assessment and subsequent training choices. Great vid, guys, thanks!! ‚ù§"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Listening to Luke and Sam going back to when Rosco, Freddo, Shadow, etc had to be isolated then cut away to everyone laying next to and on top of each other totally content.  Just amazing.  It‚Äôs so easy to forget when these dogs were pure aggression.  Amazing job, Luke.‚ù§"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Luke is so nuanced and careful of explaining his thoughts. These lovely honest conversations are true gold. Thank you üíö
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love all your canine assistants on the build, Luke! üòÇüòÇüòÇüêïüê∂‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è How are the cabanas coming along??? ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂üá®üá¶"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Please remember to like this video!!!
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I've watched Rosco since he arrived, often viewing videos multiple times. Luke illustrated  the complexity of interpreting Rosco's intentions with two scenarios: is Rosco standing at the house door asking to come in so he can pour love on the children or is he standing at the door with a 'little piggy, little piggy let me in' intention.  It dawned on me that I have no idea which is why I'm not an expert doggie trainer! I can't read Grumble bum's intentions!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love to see Joey at the small pool. She looks like she is ""pretend herding""....lol ü•∞"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,To me Roscoe moves like a big cat. I watch his movement and he is so beautiful. So I guess his lack of facial expression could be like a big cat too!  üêÜ
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Again it saddens my heart that we only have Bad Dogs because of humans. And how many poor souls have been put to sleep being mis-assessed. My THANKS goes to those like Luke and Sam who Truly want and give what a Happy fulfilled dog needs ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Thanks for answering my question.  I think he has always been more fearful.  He is afraid of most dogs.  He runs up to them and barks in their face with the shackles up.  If on leash he barks and goes crazy when dogs go by.  He never attacks them but when a dog gives it back to him he is submissive.

So my understanding from Luke‚Äôs opinion it‚Äôs not from not being desexed nor doing it will ‚Äúfix‚Äù the issue.

Thanks so much.  I respect your opinions greatly."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Roscoe makes a plush, comfortable full body pillow that Maggie has the smarts to take advantage of."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Maggie certainly knows how to relax, 2 pair of undies great quote about Rosco. Hope having fun!!!!!!! Yay the pool everyone time for barking fun. Rover has found his fins!!!! Cheers Rosemary Perth Western Australia 72yrs"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Like Chance‚Äôs intent is to be a good boy but he is still learning to deal with his serious trigger for serious bad behavior.  
This isn‚Äôt new for Luke as he has always had to analyze and test new daycare applicants."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"""One size does not fit all,"" is so appropriate; for dogs and people too!!  I enjoy Luke's viewpoints regarding his dog training & experiences.  Having  so many transformation in the Shelter pups has been amazing to see, after going through their training and socialization.  Sam, you are also an integral part of the training (through your observations and experiences) and have great information to impart from your perspective as well. You and Luke are a great team!!    I love that Roscoe is so vocal now; he is such a character.  Luna jumping the pool fence for a swim....classic Luna!!  I love watching the videos and your commentary, playfulness, teaching moments, etc.  Your whole family is involved so we get to see how the kiddos interact with the pups and The Queen (Miss Kitty Rose, who probably thinks she is a pup too)!!!  Thank you for sharing the information regarding some of the questions posed.  üëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"With Roscoe and his growl, if there was danger for the family, would he growl?  Have a different growl?  Skip the growling and go for a defensive position?  Guess I'm asking if he could possibly have a whole vocabulary of growls.  Thanks!

PS:  Any update on Rover's surgery?"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,What a picture of a truely relaxed pair. The big beautiful Roscoe asleep with gorgeous Maggie - totally relaxed and sprawled out next the big one. A warm fuzzy moment ‚ù§‚ù§üòÇüòä
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"If you put 3 dog trailers in a room the only thing they could agree on is two saying the third‚Äôs methods are wrong. I have been told by a ‚Äúprofessional ‚Äú dog trainer that a dog was hopelessly aggressive and should be put down, mainly because that trainer‚Äôs methods wouldn‚Äôt work for that dog. That trainer could not accept the idea that another training method might work. If her‚Äôs didn‚Äôt nothing would work. Too many narrow minded people in this world!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Its so impressive how this pack works so well together, thanks to all the hard work that goes into these doggies. Nothing like patience, love and support to help these beautiful doggies live their best lives!!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I always love hearing Luke‚Äôs opinion on dogs behavior and training and such‚Ä¶ thank you for always taking the time to explain things so well üòä
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Thank you for this great explanation on reading behavior and body language. I have more experience in the horse industry, but the same rules apply. You have to judge each animal as an individual, one size does not fit all."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"seeing that lovely sunshine in Australia,is making me happy üòÅ,it's freezing ü•∂‚ùÑÔ∏è cold here in the UK .  Luke is a man of all trades.look at the dogs just waiting patiently by Luke ,rover is so lucky to have such a loving family and wonderful home and amazing doggie brothers and sisters to live with . not forgetting little kitty üêà rose cat sister , Sam is mother hen and Luke top dog .God bless you all for all you do.x"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"That was quite an interesting video.  There is a lot going on that you thought you saw, but when it is explained you realize you didn't see it at all.  Rover at the gate is an example.  There was a bunch of lazy pups today,  they all seemed to have lost some sleep üò¥ last night.  Well at least they were not helping Luke today.üôÄüêï‚Äçü¶∫üòÇü§ó"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love this video many questions answered. I think your ‚Äúno announcement‚Äùthat Hope  is an Evans doggie,  none needed,she‚Äôs home .Especially because of what you shared. She needs you because of her awful situation prior. Faith would love it too because her Daughter would be safe from future harm."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"We get Roscoe as we have a rescue who does exactly the same and even shows her teeth, friends and our dogs understand but it can be frightening for other dogs and people until they realise its only talking"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I will say a lot of what you say come thru on camera. Meaning: u do such a great job of capturing the essence of not just the farm ..but the animals themselves. (""Appreciated"")! Moreover: u let's us get to know the family. Share in the day to day. Extra special!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Sam you are so good with getting you husband explain so well assessing a dog and making people understand that every dog is different not every situation will be the same Sam and Luke are a great team thank you for sharing your knowledge
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Talking about the positions of a dog's tail and the meaning of it.....a pug's tail is always in a position that could easily be interpreted as an offense to other dogs and when a dog doesn't know how to communicate that little pug is in trouble. So there is no ""guideline"" or ""manual"" besides every dog is an individual, like Roscoe the growling lovebug..."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"When Roscoe growls off camera, he does sound like a lion in the bush, or even an alligator‚Ä¶..really fierce sounding!"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Roscoe and Maggie so relaxed . Very interesting talk about training, every dog is different. Watching Rover walking behind Luke when he was talking about him , Rover is so calm. All those supervisors laying around while Luke does all the work üòÇ. Miss Red and Miss Violet have certainly filled out ,not little anymore. I love the entire pack but Roscoe is certainly a unique character. If we lived there I would adopt Roscoe , Tank and Chopper . üíúüêæ"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Thank you for your take on why to desex your male dog.  I won‚Äôt go into all of my story but hearing your reasoning helped me a lot to hopefully help my young male terrier who came to us at about 9mos from a breeder as a bully.  I‚Äôm sure he was picked on & he lived in chaos before coming to us. I did have him neutered quickly.  This was very helpful.  Oh & he is very vocal too.
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Great, informative video.  Everyone should understand that Luke is giving his opinion on the various topics, although his opinions are always spot on!!  Thanks for continuing the videos Sam.  I know it‚Äôs extremely busy on The Farm with all the Christmas preparations.  Hubby and I are quarantined (ugh) and I‚Äôm so thankful for your videos.  He has basketball to watch and I have the Evans Family channel to watch.  I have the better deal!! ‚ô•Ô∏èüêï‚Äçü¶∫‚ô•Ô∏èüêï‚Äçü¶∫‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Love the positions Maggie gets intoüòÅ. And good for Luna getting into the pool when she wantsü§£.
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Wow, such an informative video especially about Rover and Roscoe. I've learned so much and it does make perfect sense. Thank you"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"It just shows us all the right environment, the correct training, and the unconditional love, makes all the difference...xo"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Even though dogs like Freddo and Rosco have been through training, would they protect the house pack if needed by using their previous knowledge?"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Dear Luke watching the dogs laying on the ground reminds me of growing up on our farm. Thankyou so much you do just an amazing job I really enjoy watching the coming and going if the fur babies Thankyou you are appreciated ‚ù§
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I advocate for non-show dogs and cats who are not intended to have bred, to be spayed or neutered as soon as old enough to have the operation safely done as determined by your Veterinarian.  May save animal lives,  you see less poor behavior, eliminates or lessens middle of the night ""Cat opera"" and roaming by male dogs and especially cats."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,These videos are so valuable & my appreciation is beyond wordsüôèüèªüòáüêæüíúüêæüòÜüíúüêæI feel these can help all ages & stages with our beloved dogsüê∂
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"My GS was very vocal. It was fine with our family but with other people, it could and usually meant ‚Äúyou better back away or I will attack you!‚Äù!‚Äù"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,When it comes to understanding cat behavior Jackson Galaxy is my go to person.  When it comes to dog language Luke is the best.
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I love watching Gus help with the digging! Happy building Luke.üêæ
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Have been watching the farm for a while  and so enjoy my daily fix of farm life and watching the transformation of troubled pups joining the pack and at last enjoying the life I love Lukes's training methods
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"I love a dog who can be vocal, Roscoe is a talker. üê∂üó£Ô∏èü§ó"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,Something about getting into the pool that truly transforms the dogs working on socialization
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Such great information about dog behavior from Luke. I always get some great piece of info that I did not know before and can use.

 I will have to say I see the 4 legged helpers are still a bit ""lazy"". They dig a little hole here and there,move a peg once in awhile,but overall seem very content to just ""lay""around,especially Maggie.Good gig if you can get it. ü§£ü§£ü§£

They were all ready for the pool. Good job Rover getting in by yourself. Of course always laugh at Miss Violet running her little legs off around,and around the pool.

üíúüê∂‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Well said, Luke.  We've always had pets & having them ""Fixed"" around 6 mos. has helped keep them innocent.  Our vet suggested we have our shelter cat fixed to stop spraying, it did not work!  We had to train him like a dog to get him to stop.  That cat...""Kitty"" would come running when we whistled, obey commands & lived to be 22 yrs. old before passing."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,my old dog Blaze  was exactly the same as Roscoe. he would grumble all the time . He was a Staffy x American Bulldog. He  would also freak people out with it .
15,7zZJdukpsh4,You should talk about either Chopper or Tank who refused to leave the farm. I can't remember which one but they just decided they were staying. LOL How awesome to see Maggie snuggled with Roscoe. Freddo and Rover laying together. These slower days I'm sure are good for Nevaeh even though she is a girl on the go she needs to rest her leg so she is ready to go to her new home whenever that happens. Luke it shows what a responsible trainer you are because you don't people to get the wrong idea and try and to integrate dogs into their own packs before they are ready.Luke realizes it takes a trainer with experience in agressive dogs and not for people to just take a small amount of information and go for it because they could really cause their own dogs harm.  I remember a time when Luke wanted to let two dogs go and see what happens Jason and Sam looked at each other and said are you sure? It went as Luke planned but it was funny. We miss Jason. Also taking in the breed of the dog is important but also you may not know if there was inner breeding and the issues that could cause. I see so many dogs and cats in shelters or living on the street and to many get put down. So I believe in desexing or what we call spay and neuter for that reason. The dogs were so happy to go to the pool but they wanted some toys while in the pool too. LOL
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Luke the more you talk the more I learn. But also the more impressed I am with my own understanding and intuitive read on dogs. You gave me a lot of good suggestions to advance my own training also in this video. I appreciate the way you frame your answers and it helps me see I am going in the right direction.  I appreciate your humility also in that we need to constantly reassess what is happening with an animal and what things mean. Because we don't want to file them into a box. Humans and animals are very multifaceted.  So many things play into what makes each individual who they are. There is no special formula.  Environment, experience,  emotion, energy can create any dynamic with a dog and its human, and the next human with that dog can create something entirely different.  Learning what is predictable will help to find what isn't and to make adjustments. This is always ongoing.  
You're brilliant you two."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"Wonderful supportive Pack .
Luna must be so happy among her old pals. She's one great escape artist."
15,7zZJdukpsh4,"‚ÄúWhen visitors come to the farm they bring 2 pairs of undies‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ on meeting Roscoe! Interesting chat. My question is regarding Rover, does it confuse the pack that he will have both male and female hormones especially as he is still intact? I mean it doesn‚Äôt seem to as they are all ok with him, but initially would it have made a difference?"
15,7zZJdukpsh4,I love body language chats and analytical chats fun thank you
15,4NUSAomA6B0,The way she figured out the holes were big enough to fit through and tried to make her escape! üòÇ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Ivy's face while you were washing her was like, ""I can't believe this is happening to me! :( """
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy‚Äôs face the entire groom: ü•∫
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"‚Äú‚Ä¶.If you‚Äôre going to give me trouble, then I‚Äôm going to give you the bubble.‚Äù Hahaha new mantra for Girl With the Dogs. üòÇüòäüôå"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Honestly, the way her tail was twitching I half expected her to try to deface you the moment she got wet. The fact you made it that long before kitty went boom is remarkable."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I like when the dude is petting her at the beginning and he is exclaiming ""kitty cat! You're already so softtttt!"" hahahaa that was cute"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Is it just me or the cameraman did an extra good job with Ivy? My dude was giving us some cinematic views of her fur ü§£ü§£ü§£
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I was expecting Ivy at any moment to put on her little hat, pull out her sword and say something really inappropriate, but instead she just attacked you!  BTW, That Crate Dryer is Genius. üëèüòª‚ù§"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I love the cameraman's very gentle ""nooo"" to the life threatening terroristic attack.

I would be out the door."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"If looks could kill but make you feel warm & fuzzy inside at the same time, Ivy went through the whole 5 stages of grief twice üòÇ"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She looks like her best friend is going through a really tough time and she feels really bad for them.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Those eyes.. just melts my heart ‚ô•Ô∏èüòªü•∞
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy's face is so precious it's hard to believe she would be fiesty she's so fricking adorable ü•∞
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy looks like an anime cat. She doesn't look real she's so perfect. Those huge green eyes. Stunning.  üíöüòªüß°
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"her little face is cracking me up, she has this perpetual expression of ""why would you DO this :("" lol. she's absolutely adorable üòç and absolutely hilarious in the little spaceman helmet"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Oh she is so cute.... Until she decided that flicking her tail isn't working and she is just going to seriously let you know she is not happy!! Thank you for letting us see  Ivy,  you just want to pick her up for a cuddle...."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"As someone suggested, that‚Äôs a great new merch idea! The title on shirts, though I‚Äôd suggest ‚ÄòGimme trouble-you get the bubble‚Äù or even ‚ÄòGimme trouble-get the bubble!‚Äô as a more smoothly worded phrase. And use this cat in the bubble as the cartoon üòÇ"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I love the deshedding intermission so the cameraman can give her pets üòÇ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I just got an equigroomer after watching you use it on cats and dogs, and this thing is amazing. Cat loves it, and I think I have brushed and entire cat out of her since last night lol"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,You did such a wonderful job with Ivy.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I love the natural sad eyes. All a part of her deceptive attack maneuvers. As for the bubble, well... You call it the bubble, Ivy calls it the Thunderdome."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I love when the cameraman has a cameo. I‚Äôm glad he gets to pet the kitties
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Are you sure Ivy didn't escape from Shreck??? Her eyes are ""those eyes""! And what a temper!! Haha! Thank you for sharing videos as well as you knowledge. Where I live, we haven't got groomers like you and I must groom my recue ones by myself (10 dogs, 6 cats, different sizes and temperaments), so I learn a lot and I can say this summer, they are looking much better than years before! If at any point I'm able to buy something from ""the outside"", I'm nuts about your shampoos, the noosel and de equigromer!!!! (I love in Argentina, so our currency is reeeeaaaly devaluated and besides, we are not allowed to buy in USA dollars, or any dollars! üòï)
Anyway, I enjoy and learn a lot from you, so thank you again. üíõüêæüêæüåª"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Ivy has that clear look on her face that says ""death to all groomers""."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Ah a British Shorthair! They're so popular here and I can see why, I've always wanted one as well üòÇ"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,My God this cat is beautiful! Her golden fur and Jade green eyes. She almost looks like an anime character. Lucky person who ever owns her. I‚Äôve seen lots of British shorthairs but never one with this coloring. Absolutely gorgeous ‚ù§
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Her little face when you started her bath was so sad and so adorable.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"wow she almost escaped through the hole!  that's one clever kitty!  (and gosh so adorable, even though she gave you the trouble lol)"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Now we totally need GwtD's merch with Ivy's picture and slogan that says, ""Give me trouble. Get the bubble."" I totally feel like this about some people. I can't be the only one."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy is a beautiful cat!  Her face is so expressive!  and... the strike was very unexpected!  She is fast.  and KIT is the cutest dufus!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She's so cute. What a sweet face.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She looks so worried!!!!  What a wee cutie ü•∞
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Looks like she was mostly very good - I really thought she'd pop before she did! I was wincing a bit when the gentle tail flicks became tail taps.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I like to watch the dogs but I simply love it when you do cats ü•∞
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy is incredibly cute and looks chronically concerned
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I like the fact she gives them a chance like a strict warden üòÑ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Two suggestions from a lifelong cat person. I've noticed you call dogs by their names but generally call all the cats ""cat"" or ""kitty."" Actually, cats often DO respond to their names, even if they are not as obedient as dogs LOL. It might help to use their names! Also, I've had a cat professionally groomed using a high velocity dryer like yours, and it really scared her, which worried me. When that same kitty got very old, I began regularly bathing her myself. What I found is that using first a soft, warm towel, and then a regular hair dryer on low velocity worked great. I turned the heat to a higher setting and she LOVED that, while less noise and lower ""blowing"" kept her from being scared. Sometimes I'd gently brush her while I used the hair dryer. It took a few minutes longer but worked out much better. She even began to welcome getting bathed and dried."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"When I was living with my parents, we got our first cat, a British Shorthair! Out of all the love I gave him, whether it's squeezing him lovingly(yet gently of course), kisses, tummy rubs, I haven't lost one of my hands yet! Sometimes, he tries to bite my hand, only to lick it clean afterwards! But what you said is quite true, I haven't met a cat that sheds as much as my boy Arthas does. Just rub him once and he sheds there, even though he's brushed in regular intervals. 
Now that my parents go out of town for their summerhouse stay, they take Arthas with him and I cannot see him that often now. I miss my baby. :')"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I need to get one of those bubbles, would make dealing with my cat substantially easier lol"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Today I will be grooming a black domestic shorthair cat. This cat was recently hit by a car, and resurrected by being placed in an ancient burial ground.

The owners have asked me to use my strongest shampoo, as they have tried bathing him, but can't seem to get the smell of sour earth out of his fur.

This cat was very lethargic during his bath. At times, it felt like I was washing a piece of meat. As you can see here, his eyes sometimes glow. This is one of the byproducts of being resurrected in a burial ground.

Crossing an ancient barrier to resurrect a recently deceased pet is something I cannot recommend. It tends to not end well for you or your loved ones, and with animal shelters receiving countless unwanted animals every day, I would recommend adoption instead."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,That cat is absolutely gorgeous. Thank you for the videos - I've learned a lot watching them
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Truly iconic, she even had me fooled and scared the mess out of me with that snarl. üò≥üò©ü§îüòÅ"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"My cat is an Ivy as well, I used some tips from you when she fell in a vat of motor oil chasing a bird last weeküòÖ."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"It¬¥s been so long since we saw, Mayo get ""pampered"" is he ok? please let me know!"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"She's adorable, yet she's got the perpetual sad eyes."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"As a proud servant to a BSH myself, I can confirm - the amount of fur everywhere is astounding üòÖ"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I couldn't stop watching her tail - you know a cat means murder when they look like a rattlesnake is living on their butt!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"What a baby!! You did very well when Ivy swatted you. As a cat Mama of 5 and prior rescuer, I'm always surprised when they swat me. It's so rare."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Love the industrial size gloves you had on whilst bathing her. Hilarious!
Adorable cat!"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Looking at the footage, I could feel Ivy is a bit tense whole session, even with just brushing/combing. That tail twitch gave it away"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"My last cat always climbed up and over me, always while soaking wet and soapy, then because I always closed the bathroom door, he would yowl to be let out."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"can confirm british shorthairs shed a ton, even a few years after she passed we have carpets full of her fur."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Your reflexes with cats are good lol I immediately said to myself...oh damn good thing she's got such good reaction time ahaha you obviously are amazing at your job so im not surprised..what a beautiful cat this episode
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"When you were brushing her, I thought I heard her say, ‚Äúwhy are you taking away my fluffs?‚Äù"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Too cute üòç üíï
15,4NUSAomA6B0,When she tried to make an escape out the dryer through the arm holes üòÇ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I love this channel. It's like a gift from the serotonin snack machine.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Given the quickness of that reaction, seems like that comb might have hit a sore spot of some sort lol.  She was calm before and after."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She saved up and timed that strike to perfection üòÜ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I‚Äôm curious about the use of the pet cologne on cats, typically I hear they are very sensitive to smells and their comfort and ownership of their territory is tied to their own natural smell. What‚Äôs the benefit of using it for cats? I get it for dogs haha"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy seemed so relaxed and like she was maybe enjoying the combing so I was surprised when she reacted like that.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,My god. Them eyes. I'd surrender all my belongings to a cat that looked at me like that.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Love how calm she was for most of it
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"one of my cats would go nuts if you even held her, much less a bath. you'd need a titanium bubble."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"British Shorthairs are amazing cats. If you are thinking of getting a Scottish Fold for the cute ears, also know the Scottish Fold comes with lots of health issues because of this. British Shorthair is basically the same cat but without folded ears."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Such a beautiful kitty!  And those big eyes looking out of that adorable face! üòª
15,4NUSAomA6B0,That was a sneak attack. Ivy was quick on the draw
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I'd like to know more facts about the cats you groom, like where they originate or what they were specifically bread to hunt, etc."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,The flicking tail says it all!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"These are beautiful cats, I love their markings."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy is gorgeous! I absolutely love the British shorthairs!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Oh my goodness - those eyes!!  So amazing.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,What a beautiful cat! By the way - you are the most professional groomer I have ever seen :) my yorkies are big fan of you too:)
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I don't  think my old boy ever stops shedding!  It always amazes me how he's not bald!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"We've had 3 British Shorthairs. All adorable. We were told that they don't shed much but 2 out of the 3 certainly did! In general very laid back cats but this one made it obvious, with the tail thumping, that she was not happy!"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"""Kit the Apparent Doofus"" Now that's a breed I can get behind. ;P"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Her sad face made me want to hug her.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"damn. i had a calico that looks just like her. she had button nose, and tiny ears."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"I was sad before I saw this, thank you for showing this lil baby. I have been subbed for 2-3 months so far but I don't have to regret it. :)"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"The way she lifts her butt while still wagging her tail at 2:10 ü§£ ""Oh that feels good... but I don't like it!"""
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She looks so permanently sad it is so adorable. She is a stunning beautiful
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Always hope to see the cats become astronauts.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Ivy is gorgeous, I love British Shorthair cats ‚ù§Ô∏èüêà"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"When the tip of the tail starts twitching, it's time to gear up with the protective gear."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I was literally waiting for this cat to break out and say something in an Antonio Bandares Spanish accent. üòÖ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,That is the cutest cat I have ever seen! Those big eyes!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She's so adorable!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,She is so incredibly cute! I love the British Shorthair! ‚ò∫
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I adore British short-hairs. Blue ones especially
15,4NUSAomA6B0,With Ivy her appearance can be deceiving.  Great job.  Hope the wound heals swiftly. üôèüôè
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"If you look at her tail, you ve notice that all time she was preparing for... defend herself."
15,4NUSAomA6B0,she was so eerily quiet üòÇ
15,4NUSAomA6B0,That cat has resting ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù face.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I love how her eyes just scream HELP MEEEEE all the time 0:58
15,4NUSAomA6B0,I think these are my favorite cats‚Ä¶ the blue ones are amazing looking.
15,4NUSAomA6B0,That's the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen üòç  But 0:53 just killed me üòÖüòç
15,4NUSAomA6B0,Ivy is so beautiful! I love the eyeliner look!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"Her coat is so unique!  I‚Äôve never seen a British shorthair with that coloration.  I‚Äôm always a sucker for orange cats, but this one is especially beautiful.  She almost looks like a painting"
15,4NUSAomA6B0,omg that round fluffy face. sooo cute!
15,4NUSAomA6B0,"The way her tail kept flicking back and forth reminded me of how humans tap their fingers when they're becoming very  impatient with something. And, when she growled she didn't really strike out to harm you, at least it didn't seem like it from this angle. She did look gorgeous after her grooming!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Ive never seen Coyote so happy before.


Quarantine really takes a toll.."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"It‚Äôs nice to see someone as enthusiastic about earthworms as I am. I can‚Äôt leave a worm on the pavement, I always have to re-locate it somewhere where it won‚Äôt get dry or trampled, and doing this almost made me late for a test (my train to college got delayed, but saving little wriggling lives is more important to me than a psychology essay)."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love watching coyote be wholesome rather than writhing in pain on the ground üòåüíï
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love this video on principle. I *love* collecting earthworms for my gardens and saving them on sidewalks üíñ They're also the very first animals I'd ever learned how to handle. Which started my love of all animals and has culminated in my love of arachnids and reptiles.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love watching your videos and how you show us many different types of creatures
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Getting a picture with coyote is on my bucket list.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,This is so cool!! I actually bought a terrarium and made a slightly similar habitat for some pet snails I took from my garden! I've had them for about a month now and I've been keeping their habitat clean and I couldn't love them any more!!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Imagine going to a park in Ohio, just to see a full grown man on the slide with a box of worms 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would do that"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I like this, I've always collected worms for my garden. They really do so much for soil and the environment."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"My favorite part is when he says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good worm right there.‚Äù"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote: ""Hey worms, wanna go watch some Netflix?""
Also Coyote: ""It doesn't have proper eyes, but it does have a mouth"""
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Thanks so much for the great video! Our young daughter learned a lot and are ready to build our own worm farm!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Coyote always has the best adventures.  Even with worms!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Thank you so much for this video Coyote!! We love watching you on Animal Planet, but my sons love your YouTube and LOVE worms!!!!!! Be brave! Stay wild!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Lol the outro is so hilarious. Coyote we just love how you're so energetic and funny.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I hate how people dislike and think he‚Äôs being mean to the wildlife by taking them from their home.  If anything, he‚Äôs saving them because if he didn‚Äôt do that most of them would probably get eaten by birds in a few days"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,When I saw this video the first thing I thought to myself ‚ÄúWhat is coyote doing in Ohio‚Äù of all the exotic places he‚Äôs been Ohio seemed to be the strangest place I‚Äôd hear him ending up in
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I've always loved worms! Such interesting, innocent little creatures."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,this man never fails to make me laugh- this is ridiculous lol but i love it
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"what a nice calm and wholesome video, i remember after it rained my grandpa showed me how to dig up and look for worms and i scared my relatives with the ones i found
this is how this video feels, warm and happy, and moist"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I built a worm farm when I was a kid, although I don't think mine was as good. lol I really enjoyed this! Kind of makes me want to build another worm farm!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote:spends time with his worms
Worms:works super hard all day
Coyote:plays with them
Worms:let me work!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,That awkward moment when Coyote told the audience in the beginning worms don‚Äôt have eyes and told us in the end he‚Äôs going to watch Netflix with the worms... interesting... üòÇ
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Thanks Coyote! I am starting my own worm farm at my house.Thank you for showing us how to make a worm farm. We live in Cape Town.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote: I never thought worms could be so fascinating.

Worm: let me go"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,9:05 - 10:15 was the highlight of my day üòå
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I like the intro it‚Äôs really cool and unique 
I think you are really brave 
And you make me happy when I‚Äôm sad face my fears on bugs and other things 
There are so many things I could say so I will just say Thank you from everywhere 
This channel is amazing I love you and the crew Thank you"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Great video by Brave Wilderness.
It at least helped to ease some of my anxiety about dealing with worms."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,This channel deserves even more subscribers than it has
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Coyote keeping us entertained in quarantine‚úä
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote sounds so happy in this episode, probably because he's working with harmless earthworms :D"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"They get big those Nightcrawlers, I have them here in Australia on my Micro farm where I farm worms to make my Artisan compost!
Great video, love it!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,HA. the ending where he spends time with the worms is so cute!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I really want to make one but I‚Äôm scared of bugs üòÇ
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,i‚Äôd just imagine someone driving and they see a middle age man picking up worms in the forest and the road
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I like how this doesn't need massive amounts of Redstone like some other farms
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I wish I could be the worms and SPEND time with COYOTE :)
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Yes! I have been looking everywhere on YouTube on how to make a worm farm! I actually have 18(I'm still getting more so I prob have more that 18) in a bucket filled with dirt, leaves, and some small sticks. I love worms and I think they are cute. (Yes I know I'm weird.)"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Watching this video to start my own worm farm for fishing bait. Thanks for the content üòÅ
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Disclaimer: No worms were harmed during this video and yes coyote made them watch Netflix even tho they can‚Äôt see.            

Appreciate the likesüòÖ"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,You are so brave!! I am actually watching this to overcome vermiphobia lol. I have so much respect for you as it would freak me out lol!!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I want a worm farm for fishing. Building a farm this way seems like there would be a difficulty getting them out
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Excellent editing. Great video. Thanks!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,The end of the video was so adorable I couldn't take it
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,...Wow this is fascinating...I‚Äôve always loved to watch worms so this is not different for me.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote: I've never had so much fun with worms!

Worm: LET ME FREE"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"If you haven‚Äôt already, you should make a Rolypoly/Pill bug farm‚Äî would love to see that üòÇ"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,The weirdest thing is I've been thinking of making a worm farm for a long time and then I found this video!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,That moment at the end when you realize Coyote has lost it just like everyone else.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,This made me smile so hard üíï‚ù§Ô∏è
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I love this  video, its so easy for kids and a pet that kids can enjoy, its so good!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I love this type of video, pls make more! Coyote"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"This video reminds me of my first time holding a worm to feed catfishes in my uncle's farm and then white liquid came out from its skin.. Ofc I was shocked then I threw itüòÇ Idk what kind of worm that is, but I think it's different from those worms that you got in the video.."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Facts: coyote gets excited and acts like a child when he sees animals that arent dangerous and poisonous
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,coyote:that‚Äôs a good worm.                    *  puts worm in the container* worm:hey guys he complimented me. *that worm so happy* the other worms *me too buddy me too* *ohh üòï. oh well*
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love your sense of humor üòÇ. You crack me up
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I haven‚Äôt watched you for three years! And your so different nowüòÉ you are still amazing!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Hello Coyote! Why don‚Äôt you make an episode about axolotls? They are very cute and very interesting. And not many people know about them.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"This man brings us nature experience even through this pandemic,mad respect for him ‚úä"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I just watched ""Kiss the Ground"" and started learning about everything needed for organic farming. Thanks Brave Wilderness!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,This really helped! Now I can dig for many worms!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,This is me and my daughters at home.  ü§£üëèüòÇ We are collecting them for our chickens.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Worms are the secret to any great garden! I raise 2 million worms for compost for my garden, but also to educate gardeners on how easy it is to raise their own worms and get away from chemical fertilizer. :)"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Hey coyote! I've been following your episodes since 2017 and I'm happy a new episode is out anyways have a good  time
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"I was actually trying to build a worm farm but had no idea what they needed and I came across this video! I was like YES, something from someone I‚Äôm familiar with üòÇ I‚Äôd rather learn from Coyote Peterson instead lol"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Coyote a year ago: today we‚Äôre being stung by a giant hornet                                                     Coyote now: today we‚Äôre gonna be looking at worms
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love the ending of this video. I want worm pets now.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"‚ÄúThe wetter, the better‚Äù Coyote knows..."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I've probably watched this like a thousand times I don't know why it's just so interesting :) worms really are fascinating
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Thanks for the vid I have a baot and my dad left me in charge for getting worms for fishing so this is very helpful and I like worms they are soo cool and cute!!

Coyote: worms are cool. (Not when they poop on you)"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"‚ÄúWorms make great pets‚Äù




The worms didn‚Äôt love me as much as my last pet"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,How does coyote make me want a worm farm ü§™
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Coyote, my dude, I'm absolutely digging the new intro!"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Hey Coyote I was wondering what is the tool you were using to dig and lift rocks? Looks super useful. Also I was interested in the pants you are wearing. Are they waterproof? Where can I get some? Lastly what brand/model is your watch? I like it.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,i love how he always is so happy it makes me so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I‚Äôve got questions. I hope you can answer. I live near a dam for flood control. We had a heavy rain so the water was very deep for a few days.  As the water receded thousands of worms were dead on the roads behind the dam. Why are live ones still coming out and crossing the roads?  I‚Äôve collected the ones in the shallow water. How long can they live in the water. Many didn‚Äôt make it. Why are worms still crossing the road  in the morning and drying out.?  I‚Äôve been collecting them every morning and evening  to put in my garden.  If they start drying out a bit but still have movement will they live  if moistened and put into the garden?
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,He‚Äôs just happy not to get bitten or hurt lol üòÇ
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love the new breaking trail intro!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"6:02 
 Coyote: lets put a little gravel.
 

Also coyote: puts alot"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Upon seeing this new theme and all the new bio bars, I gotta say that I liked the old ones better."
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,"Worm: If I can just escape before he gets to me
Coyote: *Picks up worm* That's about 50 worms"
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Lol the end he actually told the truth about being able to do activities with worms ü™± respect ‚úä
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Love the new intro! I especially like the new map. Would be cool to see the team find giant earthworms.
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,DO NOT question the worms they make GOOD pets they are unique
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,I love worms! Adorable!
15,rSnwQ84ahNQ,Coyote I love your videos and I love the worms

15,6gohOqIpB2E,Glad to see people are helping the Monarch butterflies. They are endangered by farmers that don‚Äôt know that they are actually good pollinators.
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"Fun fact: butterflies can remember things they experienced when they were caterpillars, despite the fact they turn to goo in the pupa."
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Nothing short of incredible. One of nature‚Äôs rarest abilities.
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"Moths and butterfly's are fascinatingly beautiful creatures. Having a small butterfly eat salt from my forearm sweat is a memory and sensation I'll never forget. Electric blue wings slowly closing to white, then a flash of blue, magical."
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"I literally had the pleasure of experiencing this with one monarch, and she walked all over my hands/arms and watched her dry out and get ready to go on her first flight. It was incredible‚ù§"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,I love when the caterpillar scurries across the top. Joy.
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"Fun fact, the caterpillar doesn‚Äôt change one thing at a time, it turns into a goop like substance and rearranges themselves"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Straight magicüêõü¶ã
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"It's interesting to see the time lapse photography of, just how fast; the caterpillar becomes the monarch butterfly. Something that's very common most, in the Natural Bridges State Beach butterfly sanctuary. Never see how butterflies mate with each other. ü¶ã"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"I spent time at my uncle's farm in northwest Iowa. There was milkweed everywhere, which is the Monarch's staple food. I saw a ""migrating"" tree there once, with thousands of them. So awesome."
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"I love butterflies, I was at a butterfly exhibit employees examine you from head to toe when leaving the enclosure to check to see if there are any what they call ""hitchhikers"" on you, one time a woman was letting her young daughter run wild in the exhibit, she was chasing the butterflies while screaming, shrieking, yelling, shouting, squealing at the butterflies the woman was ignoring her, I reported them I don't know if all that activity from the child was traumatizing the butterflies perhaps it was"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Just think we all share a mother in nature that makes amazing creatures like this. Brother from another mother fosho ‚ù§
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"Mientras ellos est√©n bien y cuidados nosotros tambi√©n..
.."
15,6gohOqIpB2E,We sometimes got these chrysalises in my backyard where I grew up. I'd check back from time to time and find them empty
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Beautiful!
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"So beautiful...
This video made me very emotional.  I look at my life in the journey of the butterfly. 50 yrs old and finally feel free.
Thanks for sharing üòò"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Bless their little hearts‚Ä¶ it must be a painful transition.
15,6gohOqIpB2E,"Monarch a great example of pupation. Almost alien-like how it sheds it's skin, forms the pupa case, emerges as a butterfly on the other side. God's design majesty."
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Incredible ü•∞

15,6gohOqIpB2E,"I planted 200,000 seeds for a Monarch sanctuary in my victory garden. It's my part to help them. I live in MO & would love to see a bunch taking off!"
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Honestly I was watching that catapillar until the one above zoomed by and I was on the floor
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Thank u now I want to get a caterpillar nowü•π
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Amazing activity..from human ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Maravilha
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Now these are just not any caterpillars these are monarch butterfly caterpillars the kings and queens of the Butterfly Kingdom these are beautiful insects. Fun fact about them they also have a toxin. They lay their eggs on milkweed. When the caterpillars hatch they eat the milkweed. That milkweed absorbs into the caterpillar system giving it an awful nasty ass taste. There is a species of butterfly known as the mimic monarch butterfly looks very similar coloration is a little different. That butterfly uses its ability to mimic the adult monarch butterfly to keep itself safe. The monarch butterfly itself is a very unique butterfly is very beautiful it is orange and black and white. That orange is kind of a rusty collar. It is a decent sized butterfly it is beautiful and very cute. As a butterfly you want to boop
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Now that pretty cool. Thanks for sharing
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Beauteous
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Socool to watch

15,6gohOqIpB2E,Amazing ‚ù§
15,6gohOqIpB2E,Whats cool is that they literally dissolve their caterpillar body and restructure them to make themself a butterfly
15,6gohOqIpB2E,It‚Äôs magical.
15,6gohOqIpB2E,How long do they live?
15,6gohOqIpB2E,How can anyone not believe in a creator?

15,7gomdayDzD8,"Randy was right about the cast net...lol Love how the cabinets are shaping up, they'll look great when ya'll are done. Love what you're doing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,7gomdayDzD8,"I thought you were supposed to try and catch them at night when they're roosting, because it's less stressful to the bird, and they're easy to catch! üíï"
15,7gomdayDzD8,This was so funny! Especially when you shook the tree and they yelled at you.  ü§£
15,7gomdayDzD8,Lily looked so happy being in your recliner relaxing in front of the fireplace.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Love your videos and enjoy watching them every time they come on. The cabinets look great. May the Lord bless and protect you and your family and the animals and you catching the roosters
15,7gomdayDzD8,"The roosters were squawking at you saying, ""Catch us if you can"". Lol. It was fun to see you, Brandi and Randy running around trying to catch them. The cabinets look so nice."
15,7gomdayDzD8,I loved how they outfoxed you by going up to the higher branches. LOL roosters are at 4 or 5 and you and Randy at 0. LOL
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Years ago I had a neighbor, that got chicks for his daughters, every easter, and without fail every year the chicks turned out to be roosters, this drove my father ( who had been raised on an Iowa poultry farm) right straight up the wall, with their constant crowing, they were kept in a makeshift pen, under the neighbors back porch, from which they were constantly escaping, until finally one day I came home from school, to find dad, standing in the yard, a can of beer in hand, watching said roosters, scratching up moms garden, without taking his eyes off the birds dad prefaced our conversation, ( which would usually have been to tell me I was the one cooking dinner that night) with "" do you still have that long handled fish net? ( our town was on Lake Michigan, and I spent a lot of my time fishing the civic pier, thus I kept the net to deal with my larger catches) when I replied that of course I did, he told me good go get it, I did dad then handed me a twenty, and said go to the store, ( a block away) and get some flour, eggs, and a box of cornflake crumbs, get yourself a snack while you're at it and take your time! So when I got home about 45 minutes later, ( my Brother was at the store too, and I decided to share dad's largess) there on the drain board,  were two freshly dressed, and cut up chickens! Dad dipped them in egg dusted them with flour, and rolled them in the cornflake crumbs, and set them to bake while I made some mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, and biscuits, by the time mom got home dinner was ready, while we were eating mom asked dad, where he had found such fresh chicken! I started to snicker, but dad gave me a swift kick under the table, and that look, that meant I had better keep my mouth shut! The next afternoon, the neighbor was out in his yard, and he asked me if I had seen his darn chickens, I was tempted to say yeah, and they were delicious, but ( not wanting to get called a chicken thief) I held my tongue, and simply replied nope! That was the last year he got them, as his eldest daughter went into a convent, and his youngest entered High School and was no longer interested in caring for chickens."
15,7gomdayDzD8,Y'all looked so intense trying to catch those roosters  it's like being kids again. The cabinets are really coming together. You've built some quality cabinets Randy üòÄ
15,7gomdayDzD8,"You guys chasing those roosters was hysterical love you trying by shaking the tree. Lol, they are laughing at you!!"

15,7gomdayDzD8,Lol...u need a stiffer gauge wire hook. Also a smaller hook. Just big enough to go around the leg but small enough for the foot to stay caught. And you're right much easier to catch when they are roosted. You guys are so fun to watch!
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Dutch, I found your YT, and subscribed all through the Arms Family Homestead. I enjoy very much watching the new house going up, and may I say it is looking so very good. Seems you, and the family made a great decision to get away from the hustle, and bustle! Your homestead is very entertaining to watch. Keep up the great videos, and be safe. I'll be watching the progress you make, and hope the YT income is helping you, and the family as much as possible."
15,7gomdayDzD8,Is so funny. Chasing chickens around. I know I've been there. You never know what they're going to do or how they're going to act. It's so fun!
15,7gomdayDzD8,They love their freedom ü§©!! Kitchen is really taking shape! Looking good üòä
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Best time to catch them is at night. Like you said,  on the roost. Those cabinets are awesome.  I need someone to help build custom bathroom cabinets like that. Unfortunately, I'm in Southern Indiana."

You and Randy are becoming

15,7gomdayDzD8,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§They‚Äôre gonna be hard to get I can wait till morning when they get down with the rest of the chickens and wait till they start eating some of the grain then pick them off one at a time

15,7gomdayDzD8,That was funny climbing up higher‚Ä¶sounded like they wer laughing üòÇüòÇüòÇüôå
15,7gomdayDzD8,Should get a big fishnet with a long handle. That would make it a lot easier to catch them.‚ù§
15,7gomdayDzD8,"LOL I can say this was one of the more funny videos of yours I have watched, I can't wait to see if you catch them LOL God bless and take care"
15,7gomdayDzD8,I hope your returning the roosters. It's just wrong to give them away when you know where they belong. They aren't hurting anything. Leave them alone. My neighbors chickens come over to see me all the time. I would never give them away.
15,7gomdayDzD8,*Keeping it Dutch neighbor appreciate your videos Listening from Mass USA TYVM üíô*
15,7gomdayDzD8,Catch them when roosting or use a larger fishing net (net on a circular frame). Good idea to have one specifically for catching chickens LOL.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Liking the kitchen cupboards .A deep spice drawer would be easy to get spices when needed not having to shuffle around .A pantry your doing is so nice since some cupboards are high hard to reach
15,7gomdayDzD8,They make a chicken net. Kinda like a fishing net but for chickens. Just a net on a pole. Works great! We got one just for catching our chickens and it makes it really easy. It was a good investment and it was cheap.

15,7gomdayDzD8,We had a chicken catcher wire but it was a stiff piece of thick wire that does not wobble like yours appears to do.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Are you planning to have a mudroom ? I think you may appreciate it

15,7gomdayDzD8,That‚Äôs so true Dutch the more room you have is more to store junk
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Does Mr. Randy have a new caterpillar he can feed the roosters?  Looking sharpe, Mr. Randy!"
15,7gomdayDzD8,Hello Dutch and Brandi and beautiful family üòäüòäüòäüòäüéâüéâüéâ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,7gomdayDzD8,üòÇ Good luck with that! Those roosters are pretty smart! üòÇ
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Definitely need a fishing net, at one time we.had about 100 chickens running free range.  When we had to house them they would fly in the oak trees. Thats when we got the fishing net."
15,7gomdayDzD8,We‚Äôre downsizing from 2500 sq ft upstairs and finished basement to a 900 sq ft basement unfinished. Perfect‚Ä¶4 bedroom to two bedroom. Less rooms to upkeep. Mud room washer/dryer in garage main level. ü§ó
15,7gomdayDzD8,Easier to catch  chickens/roosters when it's dark and they're roosting!
15,7gomdayDzD8,The cabinets are looking good and those roosters are very smart but you are smarter than themüòäüòä‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è thank you for sharing have a wonderful evening üòä
15,7gomdayDzD8,Y‚Äôall are so funny.  Got your exercise in today.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Lol I would tell him to come catch his own chickens.
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Yep, get them when they are roosting, best time too do it. Otherwise you'll run yourself ragged, lol. Love the videos."
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Suggestion is to wait till they are on roost and pick them up just like picking apples.  Chasing an animal is not the way to capture the roosters, they are to fast."
15,7gomdayDzD8,Cabinets are looking amazing!!! Yall running around with those roaster!! Lmbo!!! Love n Bless you all!!!
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Next time you try to catch chickens make a box with 1 by and chicken wire with one side open. Then turn the open side down, then tip it up on one side. put a stick under the other side, tie a line to the stick bate the trap and stand back."
15,7gomdayDzD8,"the more space you got, the more junk you collect....so true dutch....and when moving, thats when you find out how much garbage you got too lmao"
15,7gomdayDzD8,ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ can‚Äôt wait to see if you catch them üòÅ
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Randy is doing a great job, looking great are you painting them?"
15,7gomdayDzD8,Maybe call your neighbor or the guy who wants them and see if they have a net you can borrow.
15,7gomdayDzD8,I always used my Dad's deep fishing net to catch the chickens when they got out of their pen.
15,7gomdayDzD8,We had a roster that would get on the roof of the pourch. Then when you walked off the pourch he would jump on you. Well after a week of that i got all my nefews and my kids to catch him. He made a really good chicken üêî  dinner.
15,7gomdayDzD8,House looks great. Good luck with the chickens. Chris from England.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Best time to catch any chicken is in the dark and you have a bright led flash lite. Walk up to them and pick them from wherever they are roosting.
15,7gomdayDzD8,"That was a funny show, especially when you goosed one of them.  Thanks for the entertainment."
15,7gomdayDzD8,"You need a long handled ""fishing net"". What's hard is to many branches on the ground where your trying to walk. We don't want any face plants! Thanks for sharing ü§ó‚ù§üëç"
15,7gomdayDzD8,offer the neighbor to come over and catch his roosters.  He is the one who let them free roam
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Hi there. Refine your hook then place feed on the ground, lay the hook on the ground facing the feed. Crouch behind the hook and allow the rooster on the feed. When he turns his back to you gently lift the hook and place it around his leg, walk forward and place you fingers around his legs and lift the bird on your hand. God bless."
15,7gomdayDzD8,"What you could use is a good old fashioned box trap with a box, stick, string and chicken feed."
15,7gomdayDzD8,Good evening from Syracuse NY everyone thank you for sharing your adventures and your farm
15,7gomdayDzD8,"Hey, if you spend that much time every day trying to catch them, they may decide it‚Äôs not worth coming over to your property... After a month or twoüòÜ"
15,7gomdayDzD8,We always waited till they go roost and caught chickens
15,7gomdayDzD8,How about setting up a couple of live traps where they roost? Couldn‚Äôt hurt and you wouldn‚Äôt be running through the woods with a pole so much. Just a suggestion.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Laughed so hard trying to catch those roosters.
15,7gomdayDzD8,The cabinets are looking awesome keep up the good work
15,7gomdayDzD8,Randy' a good sport... carpenter to chicken wrangler. LOL Best wishes from northern Illinois.
15,7gomdayDzD8,This would be a good situation to try a snare or trap for a chicken.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Hey Dutch get them with pole fishing net feed them in the morning & drop the net over them if they are close enough together you might get both at same time wish you luck hope to see it on video the only thing you might not want to do is have the dogs out to help get them because they know not to chase your chickens & that just might getting them started chasing yours ok GB y'all stay safe
15,7gomdayDzD8,If you wait till its dark out you can go pick them right up.  They can't see in the dark
15,7gomdayDzD8,Lili to the rescue!
15,7gomdayDzD8,Build a box around the back of the house and then come the other way and walk them up around the house into the box and then you got them
15,7gomdayDzD8,Cabinets look really nice. I feel they are way to short should be taller. I would need way more storage.
15,7gomdayDzD8,Been there done that! Lol  A fish net is the tool you need to catch those roosters.
15,7gomdayDzD8,It's going to be big enough where they're not going to see it until it's too late
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,What other animals would be 100x more intimidating if they could fly?! We'll choose a winner
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"If you think about it, a flying bullet ant is just a regular bullet"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,A flying bullet ant is just outright terrifying üòÆ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Your videos are always the best üíØ I do receive a notification each time you post a new video.I thank you and I will forever appreciate this channel, you ve helped me and my family a lot in your video‚Äôs,we‚Äôll have regrets for things we didn‚Äôt participate in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..INVESTMENT! Should always be one any creative man‚Äôs heart ‚ù§Ô∏è for SUCCESS in life"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Mark you're so brave for doing this for our education and let's be honest, our entertainment üòÇ"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,To this day I'm still waiting Coyote to enter the bite zone with a coyote
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Question: was it scarier getting stung by the normal bullet ant cause you knew you were going to be stung, or flying because you had no idea if you were going to be stung?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,No one would've expected anyone to be doing things that are scarier than those done by Coyote. But we have Mark here defying our expectations. Both Mark and Coyote are remarkable men.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Now that's got me thinking, I feel like you should do a Executioner Wasp Vs Flying Bullet Ant."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,The pain tolerance is very impressive
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Dang that's a really good point.  I was thinking that that the winged bullet ant was older and could contain it's venom more than the wingless one but didn't realize that it might be because the winged bullet ant was just biologically different.  Thank you for this excellent experiment!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Been sick as a dog and been watching your videos again. Always a pleasure to see you Mark!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,i miss the educational animal videos. they always used to inspired me. not just clickbait and sting/bit stuff :( i miss when the whole team would actually go out into the wilderness and shoot an episode of the animals they find. it‚Äôs sad to see my favorite channels fade away.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,You took the sting like a champ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Either Mark‚Äôs pain tolerance is really good or Coyote exaggerates for the camera.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Yo bro if that guy is really fine with stings you should continue finding new species like the executioner wasp and test the stings! I haven‚Äôt ever been as hyped FOR ANYTHING as I was for that executioner wasp episode, I bet there are many unknown/rarely researched species that deserve to be documented and known"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Dude Mark is the literal man of steel, because his pain tolerance is so crazy"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Love the vids as always, Do really miss coyote doing this"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,I wonder what Coyote's reaction to seeing a winged Bullet Ant would be
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Mark was watching Coyote's stungs and now he's doing same. Good luck Mark!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"That had to hurt. You got the small end of the stinger. If the Giant Centipede had wings, it would be a bad day for a lot of things. Was fun to watch. Great video"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Coyote Peterson does these Sting challenge very well
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Glad your back to making videos,keep it up:))"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"""What's worse than a bullet ant?"" They clearly said in the past, ""The Executioner Wasp is the king."""
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Imagine sitting in your house or hotel room having a cup of morning coffee and seeing one of these terrifying insects! I'd move or cancel my trip in a heartbeat!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Since the bullet ant queens are semi claustral meaning they need to hunt before their first workers come out, I expected them to have more venom"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Nature really said:
""Hey you remember that tiny little guy you named after one of your most painful weapons? What if it could fly?"""
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"It could've easily flown away when you kinda missed with the net and then again when it was out of the jar for quite a while. That doesn't look like a situation where the ant would be ""sure, go ahead"". Any explanation why it didn't fly away?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"For someone who spends a a lot of time around insects, you don‚Äôt really know anything about ants if you didn‚Äôt know which ones can fly"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Oh look, a totally new thing that looks almost like a very painful sting insect! Let's try that one and see how bad it is!

Why?!^^"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,his reactions are way more believable than coyote's and i like him more
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,I am watching his video after 1 year and I am shocked to see that he is alive üòÇüòÇ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Brave Wilderness coming out with great content these years.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Walking right on the line between ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happier not knowing this‚Äô and ‚Äòactual scientific knowledge‚Äô as usual, Mark?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Right on Mark... keep up the posts.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Who agrees Mark is the best person to look up to when you are upset, not feeling the best, or overwhelmed? he's always so positive and comical, which always puts a smile on my face even if I'm not feeling the best :)) we love you Mark ‚ù§"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Mark gets bitten by a flying bullet ant.
Coyote behind the camera : are you okay, mark??"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"At this point, I think these guys are just addicted to insect venom"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I'm surprised you were even able to find a Paraponera alate. They're said to be pretty rare. For anyone who didn't know, the ant in the video is a reproductive, a virgin queen."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Can we respect him he takes a lot of painful stings
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"You can tell it's a queen just by looking at it, generally throughout the vast majority of ant species' reproductive alates, the queens look more like larger workers with a larger thorax (to house the wing muscles) and the drones have smaller heads that are significantly disproportionate to the rest of the body. (A quick google search of ""queen ant vs male ant"" and you'll understand what I'm saying). Also if it's already scurrying about on the ground in search of a place to settle you can assume it's a queen. *So really, you don't need to force it against your arm and see if it stings you or not to tell that it's a queen* üíÄ"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,‚ÄúI am still in excruciating pain‚Äù he says in a very calm and collected voice.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I have been breeding weaver ants for nearly 10 years, but I dare not deliberately put my hand to bite the weaver ants. You are really brave and totality"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,this guy has built himself literally the highest pain tolerance possible dude
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"‚ÄúOnly the female ants have stingers‚Äù
Well ok but also, the queen ‚Äúexclusively produces female worker ants‚Äù"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,You're very brave for doing this
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,This is the comeback of brave wilderness. Keep up the work!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I think it's pretty clear after these past few sting videos with Mark, that Coyote over reacted when he got the Bullet Ant sting a few years ago. I'm not saying that the sting isn't painful, I certainly wouldn't want to take one. But after seeing multiple bullet ant stings on Youtube, no one screamed in pain like Coyote did for just one sting. But Mark and Coyote are no doubt brave for doing this."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,I‚Äôm no expert but could it have been less painful because your body developed antibodies to the ants venom?
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,THEY CAN FLY NOW?!
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"So I‚Äôm not an expert on bugs and stuff but I love watching this. I know you said the wing is a male or something but I think that the male has no wings and the female has wings, I‚Äôm not very smart on this but that‚Äôs just me"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Damn, I didn‚Äôt know these were a thing! Bullet ants with wings on them! üò±"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Keep these videos coming bro üëçüèºüëçüèº
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Wow, I didn't knew the Bullet Ants have wings, Have @CoyotePeterson informed about this new discovery, this would surely amaze him."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Brave Wilderness x Dr Squatch was the crossover I didn't know I needed.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Wasps evolved from ants right? This definitely looks like a more primitive wasp
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,A flying bullet ant ? I've never seen something like that before.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Seems to me that it's just a regular Bullet Ant, however just one of the winged alates -- Specific members of an ant colony that are released into the wild for reproduction."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I love this sponsor, dr squatch has the best products and makes your skin healthier, other soaps or liquid soaps are classified by an FDA sinthetic detergent. That‚Äôs why I always buy dr squatch because it‚Äôs much organic and no harsh chemicals."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"So, now two questions. Since it can change its stinger into an egg layer, can it sting its eggs into a living thing. Also, when will the male winged mission begin?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"‚ÄúToo see, if the winged bullet ant is something we all need to be concerned about.‚Äù 

Wouldn‚Äôt that just be people who live where they are? Why would I need to be concerned about winged bullet ants in Alaska while I‚Äôm eating cereal in my underwear?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Thnks for the amazing episode nd for the great u r doing brave wilderness ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,This guy still surprising us with his braveness 0_0
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Real question here, which is stronger? Coyote‚Äôs left arm or Mark‚Äôs right?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I wonder how Coyote can manage the pain!
Be Brave, Stay Wild üôÉ
I'll See You On The Comments Of The Next Video!"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Those ""flying bullet ants"" are actually bullet ant alates, alates are winged female ants that take off to the skies in order to breed with other male alates in order to become a queen ant!"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I kinda miss Coyote on this channel, anyone else miss him?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Need the other guy, way more entertaining to watch"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Fun fact: If you find winged ants KEEP it if you want to take care of ants as they might be those queen ants which can lay eggs...i would know as i keep ants
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Why isn‚Äôt Coyote on here anymore as the main host?
I know he went to animal planet for his own show but that show only lasted one season in 2020‚Ä¶"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,you are a nature channel who shows off insects and arachnids a lot. how do you not know that ant queens and drones exist?
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"""The flying bullet ant isn't real. It can't hurt you.""

Flying bullet ant: _1:01_"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,This man got the same amount of lives as 1000 cats in total
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Interestingly painfully looking video Mark & Crew I liked this video yes!!!!üò±ü§ÆüëçüòÖ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Damn... Dude took it like it was a papercut! üò¨üò¨üò¨
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Wow that was crazy back 2 back days of stinging is wild u mark don't miss a opportunity when there is 1 u jump right into action do it 4 that I have huge amount respect 2 u tk u 4 what u r doing 4 experiments and entertainment u r crazy in a good way üòéüòéüòé.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Mark‚Äôs pain tolerance is nuts, just compare his reaction to Coyotes!"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Imagine getting attacked by bullet ants like you do fire ants!!!! Just one bullet ant looks insane
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Ok I‚Äôm not a regular viewer, what happened to Coyote Peterson? This was an interesting video - thanks"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Bro whats next? He's gonna get stung by all the insects that he already got stung by all at once?



For example, he gets stung by a bullet ant, tarantula hawk, cow killer, and executioner wasp at the same time"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"My wife: ""I hate when bugs fly in my hair!""

Me: Wanna go to Costa Rica?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Each time I see any ant with wings it always reminds me of a goomba with wings.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I'm sorry but I've grown up with Coyote to make me laugh,cry,etc so Mark is not the same but good job to you guy's."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Time to cross Costa Rica off my travel list‚Ä¶
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,I feel like she saw your last Bullet Ant vs Leaf Cutter Ant episode and found her way into your hotel and was dead set on getting on your show!üêúüòÖüíì
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Coyote, try brake ur leg. bend ur leg how they do it in wrestling and try to feel the pain and how u feel about the pain really getting u into the leg (Limbs)"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Ahh, the sweet suffering. How I've missed it!"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"Mark: Oh yea, stinger‚Äôs in. *Little reaction
Me: *cries when stung by bee."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"I didn't think it was a queen...fully developed, would be larger, which is why he said it was a young queen with wings.  I wonder if Mark was surprised too (but relieved it wasn't too bad)"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,This guy is hardcore üòÇ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"You might as well replace Coyote as the main host now, cause you got stung twice by two bullet ant üòÇ"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Even I didn't know about that Bullet Ants can fly and have wings
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"here is the next question, do worker ants have a more potent sting than soldier ants?"
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Sooo..... dose that mean Mark has Built Ant eggs in his arm? üòÇ
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,I thought it's interesting that ants are a  connected neighbour family to the wasp. when you see the flying males and females. You can see the similarity more.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Wonders why ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt it as potent as the first‚Äù. Well I mean you said you weren‚Äôt leaving it in for a full minute like last time lol
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"""They fly now?!""
""They fly now"""
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,"The next sting, I want to see is the bulldog ant, please do a video of that."
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Honestly with Australian weather warming up surely it's time for any trip down under. We have so many interesting animals you have yet to show off.
15,QlLcU_E6VW0,Im just mad that I'm just finding out that these monster can F#$KING FLYYYYYYüò±üò±üò±
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I swear I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a dog go from being asleep to looking utterly joyful in a fraction of a second.  She‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous, I‚Äôm so glad she found her people ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Mia has the best life ever and she deserves it!!! So glad she was rescued by her wonderful humans.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Awww I just LOVE how she doesn‚Äôt mind getting woken up by her loving family and her lil tail goes wagging. Beautiful story with an amazing Happy Ending! Thank you Mia‚Äôs Mommy, Daddy and Siblings! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"You know she can feel the positive vibes, because every time she talks sweet to her, her tail wags faster and faster."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Watching this put a smile on my face. What a beautiful and happy pup üê∂
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Mia is a great dog wow. I‚Äôd take her home asap. She has a tender heart and loving personality.  Since I‚Äôve seen a few videos of deaf dogs who seem to make out well, I‚Äôm going to keep them on my radar. These videos while they‚Äôre so precious, they‚Äôre also really helpful. ‚ù§üêï"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"WoW so sweet of you to get her,  we had a dog that was deaf, and blind in one eye. And he was the best dog we ever had."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I was a trucker.  Lots of the places I stopped were pretty noisy.  I travelled with my dog.  Because of noise, we communicated through hand signals.  Dogs don't need hearing.  Between sight and smell, they get more information about their surroundings than any human.  I Love your dog."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,GOD BLESS these people for adopting these beautiful animals!!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She just communicates with her tail--beautifully! üêæüêæüêæüêæ

15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"That pup's a sweetheart, what a precious girl."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I'm so glad you got her as a puppy so she could be taught sign language. She's just divine üíó

15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"The best female cat I ever had had been dumped in my yard in the snow.  It took me a month to figure out she was deaf!  I talked to her also, and we developed our own sign language.  I miss her every day.  Her name was Lucy."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Mia is the most heartfelt, adorable, soft communicative dog ever. She is stunning.:))))"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She's absolutely beautiful and has found a beautiful forever home. üíï ü§óüê∂
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"What a lovely couple with their dogs. Mia's adorable, not just for her ""special needs"", but because she's perhaps more sensitive to her people and other pets (and they with her). Another good thing about such feel-good stories as this is that they normalize acceptance of our differences. Every being has *something*, and we all have to adapt and change in life. These animals show us how capable we all are and what's possible.üíïüçÄ‚òÆÔ∏è"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Well, there‚Äôs no mistaking how she feels about her life!"

15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"This dog makes me smile from the inside out. What a special girl she is & I‚Äôm so glad you are her hoomans. She‚Äôs an absolute gem & her indefatigable joy is infectious. Just looking at that joyous, wagging tail made me smile so hard. Love her! ü•∞"

15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I have a deaf dog, and I love her!!... love to see this!!!ü•∞ü•∞"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Mia is adorable and so are you for giving her such a loving home. This great video shows what a powerful and healthy dog she is- especially when she's running on highspeed with your other dog. And how sweet Mia is. I bet your video will show thousands of people what a great comrade a special needs dog can be. I'm a fan of her already.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She‚Äôs beautiful thank you for giving her a home u guys rock
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Special needs babies need truly special humans to take care of them and this couple are absolutely that for her. May they all have the happiest and most joyous adventures together for many years to comeüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I'm so happy to see how the couple is giving the best life for her, even with doggie friends to play with every day. üêï"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,What an absolutely sweet and adorable baby!  So glad she found a great forever home with people who understand her special needs and love her so much!  Dogs are truly a blessing that we barely deserve on the best of days.  They are so loving and wonderful!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Oh she is so lovely! That tail! Such happiness in her face every time she is gently awoken.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Bless your heart for giving her a second chance to live happily in u and ur husband‚Äôs loving hands. Hope more people out there was touched by this wonderful story and marked as a lesson for other dog breeders to embrace puppies with congenital abnormalities or disabilities.

15,fVrYOK5gqSI,My first fur baby was exactly like Mia. you will form a bond that will never be replaced. I'm overjoyed the universe brought You together and Mia will be living Her best life. FYI Mias breed loves walks especially in the woods if possible. Best Wishes
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"This melted my heart, every bit of it üíì"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I have a 13 year old pit and he is now deaf and it really is so easy to teach them with your hands well he was already trained before he lost his hearing but I did have to show him hand signals. Mia is just a beauty and a bundle of energy she looks so happy in her forever home. Dogs are just amazing they teach us so much everyday. So happy for your new family
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Awww, Mia. Little Miss Goober. She lifted my spirits a lot in the few minutes of her video. I can't imagine living with her. Good luck staying sad!  I'm so glad she has the best life ever. ‚ù§"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"It is very easy and so rewarding! I had a cattle dog for 21 years that went blind at one year old. She adapted so well and was always so happy, that it was always a source of inspiration for me and everyone who met her."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"It is sad how many humans will mistreat pets, thank goodness for the rescuers!"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I have a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù puppy & they are so special!! So full of joy!!  I wouldn‚Äôt trade my boy for anything!  His joy is contagious!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"This lovely couple are so careful with their deaf dog, waking her up so gently to keep her from getting freaked out. You can see that she is always surprised but never scared. It is a joy to see people taking such good care of their dog's emotional health, as well as its physical health. Kudos to them! What a beautiful, loving dog!"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Such a happy girl, this video made me smile!  That tail!"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"She‚Äôs not defective. She is beautiful, sweet and loving and a gem. I am so happy you adopted her. Bless you all. üôè much love. üíï"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"This is a beautiful story - but sadly, some people in Society don't treat special needs animals too kindly, however to the people who do rescue a special needs companion animal, I can only say 'Job well done"". "
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,It's so sweet how her family gently wakes her up without alarming her. It is LOVE for sure
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"She‚Äôs awesome . I love her . Animals are amazing . I just love happy friendly pets . She‚Äôs so cute , God Bless üôÇ"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I‚Äôm in love with this doggy. So sweet, and such a wonderful family."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Thank you for giving her such a wonderful home.  She is so beautiful.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She is so adorably cute !  I just want to touch her and hug her. An angel w/o wings. God bless her .
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"All animals deserve love, that's all they want. This was a beautiful story."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"So freaking cute, the entire household."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Aww, you can see what gentle and kind soul she is. She reminds me a lot of my dog that I had when I was kid ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Thank you for saving this baby
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"mia reminds me so much of my athena lol. since i adopted her almost 3 years ago she has never stopped wagging her tail. shes just like mia when waking up, he tail goes a mile a minute while shes still trying to open her eyes lmao"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I love that she knows she‚Äôs loved ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I am so happy for Mia‚ù§Ô∏è. Im so glad her story had a happy ending. She has found a wonderful family that loves her.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I love these owners. Beautiful people to overcome such struggle with the loss of a pup and a home burned down. Stay strong üòå
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Beautiful dog. I'm in a very noisy neighborhood so I think I would probably do best with a deaf dog.  At least the sweetheart wouldn't get scared constantly, or woken up by random noise."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"With all that's going on in the world, this is perfect timing for a love story, which is exactly what this is."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"MIA has such a beautiful face with loving gentle eyes. She is able to express her Love the same way as any other dog. I had a totally Deaf Dalmatian, COPERNICUS and he was enclosed with child guards in our kitchen. He would stand up with his 2 front paws on the kitchen counter when he hears the sound of the car of any member of our Family coming from the corner of our street. He was so ready to greet any of us when we walked into the Family Room next to the Kitchen. I never knew how he did that.‚ù§"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"We had an old english sheepdog, went deaf at 12 then blind at 14, died at 16.
It used its nose and memory map to get around, would come when we stamped on the floor. Died happy. Its amazing, having a disabled dog is no harder than having an able bodied one.
When we spoke to it, it could feel the same vibrations as when it could hear. What they were hitting I dont know, but its real."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"She's beautiful and you are, too. I wish I had your family among my friends. Such positive vibes. Best wishes to you all. üíïüíïüíï"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"I had a pitbull terrier and taught her sign language and stomp vibrations..2 stomps is no, one is come..she was so smart, it was easy to teach..my neighbors loved her and wanted to learn her signs. Man she was a dream dog, had her 14yrs before she passed! Miss her everyday!"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Shes gorgeous. She is living her best life and loving it. She made me smile so hard. Thank you for adopting her.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,God Bless you. She is just beautiful. I'm glad you listened to your husband!! Other dogs will figure out she's deaf or somehow challenged and usually act accordingly.  With tenderness has been my experience. You are wonderful to take her on and she definitely looks well loved and cared for!! Hope you have a better new year! God Bless & keep you!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I literally love these content videos! So freaking positive and sweet. ‚ù§
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,What a sweetheart!  Bless you for taking her into your fold!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Oh mom, life doesn't get any sweeter for me. I have my great paw-rents and other siblings and a forever home, I can't think of anything better than this."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,My deafie is almost 11 and looks exactly like your girl and is just as joyful. I love deaf pups.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"She is definitely a beautiful animal! Thank you for taking her in.
p.s. That is a Very Happy Dog!"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,So glad she has you to love her. ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,What a nice dog. I understand why you took her home. üòä
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She is adorable! We had a deaf Dalmatian for a while.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Such a sweetheart.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,OMG she is so adorable! So glad she found just the right mom and dad to care for her.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Such a lovely doggie. We can learn so much from them.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,She is just utterly adorable! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I am glad you rescued her even though you have 3 other dogs! More power to you:)
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,I love her! You're so lucky to have her!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Good Job! I'm glad she's surrounded by her buddies to show her the way!
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,One of the greatest dogs I ever owned was deaf. Most people who came to my house never realized it unless I told them. We used to signal her to come in from back yard by flashing the porch light. I miss her.
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"The pup is so beautiful of course, but more than that the two people that are so kind and loving to take him are just as beautiful. I took a blind and deaf 48 pound Terrier myself and feel fast in love with him. Animals are on this planet to teach us all how to be better human beings. I love this clip."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Mia is so, so beautiful, she really is exquisite.  The way she placed her paw on the other dogs head was hilarious - it‚Äôs wonderful she‚Äôs with a great family. Thank you for sharing ü§ç."
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Thanks for this sweet story and for your loving energy. üéÑüíêüéÑ
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,Thank you and your husband for being such loving people to this beautiful fur baby
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,"Oh I loooove stories like this one!

Thank you for loving this precious girl so much and giving her the happiest life ever!! ‚ù§‚ù§"
15,fVrYOK5gqSI,aawww amo estos videos! knowing these great animals and the great people helping them makes me super happy ‚ù§

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"It's wonderful to hear from you again, Kyle.  This seems like a healthy place for all of your fish and animals.  Congratulations on finding this place."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"I'm here to enjoy the outdoors, I've missed your videos. They're so calming"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Those wild turtles have no idea how amazing their lives are about to become. Good to have you back dude. If you have a drone I think it would be cool to get a top down view of the new ponds.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Looks peaceful and it has a great fishing spot absolutely wonderful
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congrats on the new place. Long time no see. Looking forward to what's up coming.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Great to see you back, excited to see whatever comes from the new ponds. In regards to vids, just all the work you do, you know we love to see it and understand it, and it might avoid a lot of repetitive questions. 

Cheers"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Good to see you back!!  You and the turtles and fish were missed. Would love to see all aspects of the redux pond project.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I'm glad you decided to go for it again. It's beautiful there. I'm excited for you!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Loved the new property and ponds, definitely watching you interact with the turtles was the number 1 reson for me to sub, they are just amazing lovely animals. 

I would love to see you taking care of the new ponds or even watching the gar again. Cheers"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Great to see you! It‚Äôs Ben such a long time! Hope your doing well and keep up the hard work üëç
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congratulations, Kyle; so happy for you! I hope for all the best for you. Please, keep us updated if you can/will. Take care!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"I was just thinking about you this week and wondering when we would hear from you again. The new property looks very cool. It‚Äôs exciting to think that we‚Äôll see pet bass, gar and turtles again! Yay!!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Great to see you back! Congratulations on the new property! Looking forward to seeing your videos in the future. I found you in years ago watching you feed Tank and all the other turtles in that old pond. Would love to see some more turtle videos in the future.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Glad to see you back, and looking forward to more turtle feeding videos.  Those are my favorite!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Love the new place and ponds - Glad to see you're ok. Happy Belated Thanksgiving. Well you know us, we like to  see the  progression videos just as much as the feeding videos. So Take your time and take us along for the adventure."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"these ponds look awesome! i hope the fish like it, maybe you can do a video cast netting to show what kinds of life are currently living inside the ponds before you add any new fish"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Cant wait! Nice to see you back looking forth to seeing the turtles!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Made my day seeing a new upload bud! ü§ôüèºü§ôüèº

Excited for this new chapter!  Cant wait to see how you progress with conditioning the new bass.

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations! I'm happy to see a new video from you and the property looks really nice! Seems like a very good place for all your pets :) Good luck and looking forward to see how it works out!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"I missed you, man. Good to see you're back and can't wait for more."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Proud of you keeping at it!  :)  Vids of you cleaning up and getting the vegetation like you want it (removal and new, both) would be very interesting.  Feeding turtles?  HECK YEAH.  :)  And yes, you have fans out here.  Peace."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I love the new property! I can‚Äôt wait to see the new videos in it! I‚Äôm excited to see the fish again!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Do you think you‚Äôll build a dock?

Excited to see progress vids as you improve/update the ponds. Rescue vids too!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"glad to see you back, do things the right way this time and make it interesting for the fans. give us the chance to meet you and come fish and stuff. no pressure."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I think that turtle pond would be a good pond for trying to maintain a good supply of baitfish like you had planned at the other two.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Welcome back, this was definitely worth the wait!  Sad to say goodbye to the old pond ecosystems but last few years were tough.  Hope all the critters are doing well in their old place and it will be super cool to meet all the new animals in this new ecosystem."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congrats brother! I‚Äôm totally stoked to see what you do with your new home and property, looks to have a lot of potential, including for content! Keep up the great work Kyle!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"In SE TX, San Jacinto county, I can attest that we need rain.  My pond has slopes and creeks that feed it and even with that my water level is low.  I'm praying along with you.  Buying property is such a smart move young man.  Good head on your shoulders."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Cool to see you've found a new location of ponds to have, I definitely look forward to more turtle videos as those were my favorite. I do hope the turtles from the other ponds are doing well tho, especially given the journey that we even got em named lol"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Looks nice! Can‚Äôt wait to see the progress. Good luck!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,These ponds looks so good! Glad to see you did not give up completely. Good luck for your future endeavors!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congrats on the new property and stoked your back uploading! Can‚Äôt wait to see more consistent uploads at the new place, please keep us updated every step of the way, we all love your videos so much. I‚Äôm content with your simple feeding videos and updates, they make me so happy. Anything you do, I‚Äôll be watching üòÖ"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations on your new property. Nice upgrade and I‚Äôm happily looking forward to watch you building these ponds up. üòä
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Eeep! So so happy to hear from you again. These ponds look amazing as they are already but i just know you'll make them flourish unlike any other and the gar, bass and turtles will surely love it too ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° 

Uhhh, i dont have any video suggestions but i am just looking forward to seeing the progress with how you shape and spruce this place up! 
Adding all the animals of course.... and all the future feeding videos with  feexing rods and cameras under water. Teehee. It would be a privilege to witness!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congratulations', this is exciting news. You deserve it. You've got yourself a nice  little piece of paradise. üê¢üêüü¶Ü"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Buying already established ponds was a great idea! knowing they should stay full year around, already with vegetation and such in them just saves so much additional work. Congrats on the new land!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Omg, I was SO happy to see a notification from you that I ran straight to the video!! I am now feeling excited to see what you'll do with this beautiful place!! All the best!! *trembles in excitement!* üòç"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Would love to see some footage of clearing and readying the ponds! The journey!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations on the new property! I can't wait to see what you do with it.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Missed your videos man, speak for everyone when I say I'm looking forward to what's coming! Hope you're well!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Thank you for coming back.  I honestly thought you were gone for good in making Turtle and Gar videos.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Great to see you!  Thanks for the tour.  Love your videos üòä
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Happy to hear from you Kyle, hope you're doing great, this property seems really good, nothing like the last one"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Hey hey hey! You're back! Glad to see you back! Those ponds look amazing and one of them already has so much vegetation nice! And one of them have turtles already which is also neat. How is phantom doing? And when do you think you will upload another video? I'm sure it's hard uploading considering that you are moving but I hope you succeed!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congratulations!!üéä I‚Äôm so excited to see this new venture, looking forward to See Tank, Melon and Skittles. I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôre huge now!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I'm happy to hear that you found new properly! Hopefully there won't be more big issues like in the previous one and you would be able to enjoy your hobby again
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations in buying your new ponds. I really missed your turtles. Can you make some of  your ponds bigger?  I think you should expand at least one of your ponds for the bass fish.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I'm glad the Garr are still doing well! Excited for more of your content!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Beautiful property. Happy to see you back. I for sure want to see the fish transfer into the ponds! Maybe you can build one of those structures that brings water above the water level so fish can come up in it and we will be able to see them. Will be a hard build in a pond but would be very cool. You may be the only one with one in a real pond.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,So excited to see the turtles being fed! Missed ya!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Glad you're doing well, Fish Whisperer ‚ù§ & Merry Christmas"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I can't tell you how happy I am and congratulations. More Turtle feedings more seeing you happy! And your voice sounds so much better now than the last video at the Old Pond.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I‚Äôm excited to see your future videos on your new property. Congratulations
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Wow! What a pretty piece of property. And so much nicer than the last lot. Strange, how such an unexpected & bleak situation brought you to this beautiful place. You & your fish friends are going to do well here. The turtles too :)"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,So happy for you and the new animals that will come. So happy you decided to carry on. Cant wait!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congrats on the newest ponds. Curious to know how deep they are?
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations!  It looks like a decent property for some agriculture.  Any plans on planting some crops or raising some animals... besides fish of course? üòâ
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,That's great. Looking forward to watching you add to the property especially the üê¢.... they are fun to watch ü§ó
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Good to see you back again, man. I hope you find Tank, wherever he is. If not, well I hope he's okay at least. But let's see how this turns out. Looking forward to it."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations! Can't wait to see what you do with these ponds
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Awesome property.  Good luck with all of your plans with it. Great ideas so far

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Looks nice! Glad you're back, I loved watching your videos!"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Nice!  Glad to see you‚Äôre doing ok and great to see you back.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Dude what ever you do is going to be epic to watch, that is such a nice patch of land. Your will have so much rich wild life. I lost my land ASAP."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,TURTLES!!! What state is your new property in? So nice to have you back :)
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"I honestly missed seeing ya upload regularly cause of what happened at the last two ponds.
For video ideas:
Gar releasing into ponds
Bass catching and releasing em into new pond
Raising baby bass
Catching your old turtles(again) and releasing em into new pond"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"My husband and I have definitely missed you and your awesome videos. Your new property looks amazing. Can't wait for the future. Turtle power, lol."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Excited to see what you do with this!

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Can't wait to see new wildlife videos.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Love it. Can't wait for more turtle vids!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congats man i wish you the best with the ponds... btw idk if it matters in which pond you put the turtles since they are going to move to the other ponds if they don't like that one.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Looking forward to your future videos and seeing the turtles/fish!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Good to see you making these kind of videos again. Looking forward to the future
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"congrats! with that much land, plenty of build/renovation content and hopefully back to hand feeding these animals"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"So exciting. I cant tell how cool is for me to see this, just love the idea creeatures already living in it , happy again, coz the story continues üëçüëçüëç"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Congratulations! it's so great to see you back!!!!!! your channel has always been a favorite of mine
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,I'm so happy for new videos from you! Btw how's skittles the turtle I remember when you first found him as a baby
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"So glad to see you back, congrats on the new property"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,That is some beautiful land right there! You are very fortunate :)
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"I think some kind of submergible camera/drone would make for some really good videos. The GoPro turtle one was one of my favorites because it's such a cool perspective seeing the fish & turtles, like an aquarium or zoo exhibit. It'd be interesting to see the bottom of these ponds and everything living there."
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,"Congrats! Do you still have your turtles? Reese‚Äôs, m&m and skittles?"
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Good luck buddy. Missed your videos. You will do great. The turtles are so lucky to have you take care of them.

15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Glad you've found a new space!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,This is much better than your last property.  I'm glad the other one didn't work out now!
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Unique opportunity on this property!  Cast net them first and see what's in there
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Happy you are back! Do you plan to ever live on your property..looks great for a tiny home with a large wrap around deck.
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,With this new pond are you going to bring some of the turtles and other fish from the original pond or are you going to get a new stock?
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,What did happen to the last ponds? I miss Tank! Welcome back the property is so peaceful and beautiful
15,XBTG-sNW3Qo,Yay!!!!  Im glad.  Maybe your fish and turtles will do much better.

And have for Blue Heelers and they absolutely love all our other 300 babies. they go to the fence and all the cows line up all the way down the fence for them Blue Heeler to go and give sugars to all the cows. I asked my four Blue Heelers everyday when I go to feed my 300 other babies y'all want to go give the babies sugars is kisses. but I always say to them you won't to give the baby sugars. Then I tell my husband look at the babies giving the baby sugars. it's the sweetest thing you ever want to see. all the dogs going all the way down the fence licking the nose of all the cows every day. every feeding that's their Joy they get every day. To get to go with us to give the baby sugars. and it looks like it's the joy of the cows day two because they absolutely line up and give the babies sugars back. they stick them long tongues and lick the dogs. there's no better love in the world that you could ever get from any human. like you get from them animals they absolutely show how grateful they are. I so wish I could find a man like that to love me like my babies love me. my husband doesn't study nothing but work and working me no romance here LOL.

Their senses are definitely different from humans. They don‚Äôt have the same social hang ups that humans do."

15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"It‚Äôs always so sad, and often unexpectedly, to lose a friend and such a beautiful animal from our lives, and the pack. Livy will long be remembered."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Awwww, what a lovely tribute to Livy! She was personality plus. Her curiosity, mischievousness, and love of life and Kevin was unmistakable! Her passing will change the pride dynamics,  but it appears that is adjusting nicely now. I'm so sorry for your loss, may Livy rest in peace across the rainbow bridge.üíñü¶Åüôè"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"The loss of a loving companion is always difficult.  However Livy's life was special and she had a small part in all her followers hearts.R.I.P beautiful girl. Lovely tribute from Kev, Vyetsi and Jinny. Loved the burst of speed from Vyetsie.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Thank you for this tribute to Livy. I'll never forget my very first intro to the Lion Whisperer which was about young Vayetse, he was about 7 or 8 months old and had just lost his companion Mfumo. Poor Vayetse was devastated. Kevin thoughtfully then brought in not one but two young lionesses, Livy and Ginny to be his companions. Vayetse was so nervous he'd hide behind Kevin and reach out to them. Wonder if he misses Livy. Though he did bully her sometimes. Livy was a wonderful girl, taking out drones, bounding and jumping on Kevin."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,RIP Livy‚Ä¶. You were soooo loved. Thank you Kevin for sharing her with us and showing humans how precious these cats can be!! Take care!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,WILL NEVER forget üêÖLivy. She's up there with Amy and all the others that have passed away....Great to see Vietsei and Giny... LOVE them both. ‚ù§ü¶ÅüêÖ
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Absolutely beautiful lions, Livy will always be in our hearts ‚ù§. Have nothing but complete admiration for everything you do for these amazing animals Kevin."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sorry to hear of Livy‚Äôs passing.  She was a beautiful cat!  What a wonderful tribute.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Such a nice tribute to sweet Livy. It's strange seeing Vayeste and Ginny without Livy, but calming to see that they seem to have adjusted to her absence. She was such a beautiful lioness and she adored Kevin. Not like the father/brother figure to Meg and Amy, not like a playmate to Gabby, but as a beloved friend. She was special."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"""She's concerned about what she can catch. And he's concerned about what he can role in."" That says it all! üòÑüòÖThis was such a lovely video - and a great tribute to Livy. I'm so sad that she passed so suddenly. There's a great big hole where she once was. I hope she didn't suffer too much .... üò•But it's great to see Ginny and Vayetse carrying on the spirit - love Vayetse's chilled out nature! üòÖHe's my kind of cat! Had no idea the ladies were such successful hunters of Wildebeests - it's a testament to the way they are allowed to be lions - just as Kevin says. ‚ù§‚ù§ü¶Åü¶Åü¶Å"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Knowing that wild lions can have such harsh, often brutal lives, it‚Äôs heartening to know, Kevin, that those lucky enough to be so well-cared for there lived pretty happy lives.

But the best part is knowing that you gave them those lives with so few sad days.  They brought you so much joy in return for that love.

It‚Äôs what gives us happiness when we think of them.  Thank you so much for sharing your life with them."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,What a beautiful tribute to Livy. Thank you for sharing. I know she passed a little while back but I‚Äôm sure her loss is still felt by you and your staff.  I also enjoyed the meet the characters portion on Ginny & Vayeti.  He‚Äôs such a handsome and majestic boy and Ginny is a beautiful lioness.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I'm so sorry, Kevin. I guess we (especially you and your staff and the volunteers, who see them every day) are realising that the lions, leopards, and hyenas are indeed senior citizens, and that each day could be their last. Livy never seemed to age, which went hand-in-hand with that wonderful, happy, joyful, playful, loving personality/temperament/demeanor that possessed her. That's what makes her loss hurt so deeply. How could a boisterous, happy soul like her be sick, even die?

Her physical form may no longer be with us, but Livy will live on forever in our memories and in your videos.

""Never gone, never far; In my heart is where you are.  Always close, every day, every step along the way. Even though, for now, we have to say good-bye, I know you will be forever in my life. Never gone.""  (""Never Gone"" - Backstreet Boys [2005])"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"What terrible sad news about Livvy. 
She was a tremendous, loving character that was always up for mischief.
It's so good to see that Vyetse and Ginny aren't too upset and missing her too much. 
It just goes to show that no matter how good the treatment is that the sanctuary gives,  mother nature is the prominent force. 
Keep up the brilliant work at the sanctuary.   ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I had to smile when you said that Vayeste was a bit of a scaredy cat when he first met Livy and Ginny because I remember seeing the documentary which featured that and I still laugh when I remember that Vayeste literally used you as a human shield.
It's always a shame when you lose an animal in your care, I've been through that a couple of times in my voluntary job, and I certainly don't have to tell you that it never gets easier. My thoughts go out to you, Mr. Big Vayeste and young Ginny. Hope you are all doing as OK as you can be."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sad about Livy. She did love you so much. That must be an amazing feeling. Beautiful tribute for the Lovely Livy. Thanks Kevin. Hope you're not becoming too stir crazy while recovering. My love to your family and to you too.üòò‚ù§üêæ‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,It is still sad to hear about Livy‚Äôs passing but it is wonderful to remember her! She was a beautiful lion! Rest in Paradise sweet girl! üåàü¶Å
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I‚Äôm so sorry about the loss of Livy. What a wonderful lioness. Thank you for sharing her and all of these glorious animals with the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"No Kev, wherever you are is Mr. Big's territory. So adorable. Death is the difficult part in following channels like yours. I have followed you since the beginning of your journey through the documentaries that were published about you. Sad that so many have already passed since then. But it's still worth watching you over these years. Hope to visit one day."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I'm so sorry for the loss of such a good kitty.  I Hope Ginny and Vayetse continue to do great.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"God gave you a special mission here on Earth,you‚Äôve shown us so much inside the world of lions and animals. Thank you. Prayers to you and all who were blessed to have known her."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I‚Äôve been watching your channel since it started abs it has brought me so much joy. Livy was my absolute favorite animal at your sanctuary bc I loved her story, her naughtiness, her prankster nature, and her love for you and her pride. Those old videos of her jumping on you and hugging you and chomping on your arm are things I watch over and over. I am so sad I didn‚Äôt make it to the sanctuary to visit in time to see her because of COVID. I would love to you to do a t shirt or merch item with her and/or her pride on it. It would mean a lot. Hope she lives in your heart forever. She will in mine. ‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,RIP to the drone killer Livy üôè and thank you for giving her a fulfilled life. Wishing you a speedy recovery Kev .
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"No more tears for me today because yes Livy was such a happy cat who brought so much light and fun into that pride. Especially after Vayetse lost his brother, she and Ginny literally saved him from heartbreak. So rest in peace sweet girl! ‚ù§ü¶Å"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,It‚Äôs hard to lose the ones you love. Thanks for posting this beautiful video
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sorry for Livy's passing. She will always be remembered as a beautiful Queen ü•≤üíîüåà
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,That was beautiful!!! Thank you so much for sharing a tribute to Livy and this great video on Vayetse and Ginny! ‚ù§‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Prayers going out to you your family and staff. Blessings on her for gracing us with her gentle and kind spirit for this long. May she soar on eagles wings to kitty heaven.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I would love to see a new installment in the ""Meet the Characters"" series:  Meet the Staff!  Of course we wish to respect those who love their privacy and anonymity, but Kevin doesn't do this, all on his own. Perhaps these vital people deserve their 15 minutes of fame."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"This was a very beautiful video. I cried when Livy crossed the Rainbow Bridge and I‚Äôm crying again today. She was a beautiful lioness. She reminded me so much of Gabby. Always playful and naughty. I pray that Vayetse and Ginny will live long, healthy lives. Kevin, I‚Äôm praying for your quick recovery. Take care of yourself. We and the animals need you. God bless you my friend. Much love from the USA."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Livy will be deeply missed. I appreciate the respectful, grateful and celebratory way Kevin handles the death of these great friends."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"This is too sad. Kevin already lost Unathi, Sar, Amy, Delta, Teo, and Napoleon. Seeing Livy go is one more added to the list of lost lions. R.I.P. lioness Livy.üåπ"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Kevin I am so sorry for the loss of Queen Livy, I can only imagine it must feel like losing a member of your family. I do believe that you did give her a life full of love, happiness, and health. Queen Livy passed knowing what it felt like to be loved and she has you to thank for that. I hope the other beautiful cats are coping with the loss. Yes I believe all creatures have emotions and can feel as we do.  Thank You Kevin for your passion and love of God's Beautiful Lions."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I am so sorry for your loss, Kevin! Please know that you gave her a great life <3"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"As sad as the news of her sudden passing is, Livy got to live as good or better a life than any lion before her. We always wish our loved ones could live forever but everyone's time comes eventually and when it does we can only hope that we were able to enjoy our time here and were a positive influence on those around us. I think In Livy's case that was definitely true thanks to the efforts of Kevin and his organisation."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Vayetse is a handsome lion. Livy will be missed but she has crossed over and is running free with Amy and all the others who went before her. ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶Å
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"It's devastating to lose someone close to you, especially when you've been with that person, or in Kevin's case lioness for years."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"When you announced that you were doing a Meet the Characters Part 2, this was the group that I asked for. However, when Livy passed, it was then the one that I was dreading.
I still can't believe that my favourite, beautiful Livy has gone. I remember your difficult start with her, but watching your relationship grow over the years into something special was just beautiful. I always love the naughty cats, and Livy was on a par with Gabby for the laughs she gave me.
It is still lovely to see Vayetse and Ginny, though, as they are also favourites of mine. 
Many condolences to you and the group for the loss of Livy, and thank you for your beautiful tribute."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I‚Äôve been following for around 5 years now and honestly losing these cats is not getting easier! Each is unique and has something different to offer which brings such joy. Knowing they‚Äôve had amazing care and attention eases the pain somewhat. I can‚Äôt imagine what you feel Kev.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Hugs to all who knew and loved Livy. The way you pronounce her name sounds almost like ""La vie"" (life) in French. She was life. Now she is over the rainbow. In the afterlife."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"They are always in our hearts, even when they are no longer with us physically. You never forget their antics and the little titbits of characteristics that makes them them. Livy will always be remembered! Hugs to you! ‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"When they begin their new journey they will remember the love that Kevin gave them. They will know, they will pass it on up there, everyone will know that Kevin is a human that other humans should imitate. I wish all humans cared about all life, cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, cows,  as much as Kevin loved these wonderful cats. Godspeed to all cats, Godspeed üåé 

Thanks Kevin, please never stop loving these cats, we love them and you brother

Ps
Govegan"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Livy was so loved and will be missed. Thank you for bringing her into our lives and letting us love her. R.I.P. livy
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"It's so sad to hear the news of the passing of some of the greatest characters that ever lived. I'm still reeling over the passing of the Dark Mane Avoca that was a wild lion in the Sabi Sands and to hear we have lost Livy as well is just so gut wrenching. Amy, Livy and Dark Mane. It is life, I get it but did they have to be taken so soon.  Thank you Kevin for everything you do to help educate, protect and love these animals. RIP Livy you are sorely missed. ‚ù§‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Sorry to hear about Livy, I guess you have to come to expect these things as the lions are getting older but it's always sad when you lose a good friend. It was good to see Vayetse and Jenny. Thanks for the video Kevin. See you next week."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Even though it happened for some time but the pain is definitely not going, so sorry Kevin, I understand your pain to lose someone we love"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Rest In Peace, big girl. You‚Äôll be missed"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Those we love are never truly lost in our heart. Whether they have four paws or not. ‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I know it's probably because we don't see the lions everyday, but It always seems like Vayetse is happy to see Kevin. It makes me wonder if Vayetse ever has days where he's grumpy, and doesn't want to be bothered."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"RIP, Livy.  How sad.  Thanks for the walk with Livy's family in tribute.  Your vids, Kevin are so impressive.  I think I saw that you've been hospitalized.  I hope you have recovered and can return to walking with the lions."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sad to hear about Livy however she will always be in our hearts. The care that Kevin and his team gives these animals is absolutely amazing.  I love this channel and Kevin for what they do with so much love ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Thank you Kev for the beautiful tribute to Livy.  Her body is gone however her spirit will always be with us, never to be forgotten.  Our thoughts, prayers and love are with you, the creatures in your care and those around you."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about the loss! Your lion pride is gorgeous as always.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"This was a beautiful tribute to Livy! Was remembering when her and Ginny first arrived and what firecrackers they were!! Lol  Vayetse,  first kind of intimidated by them after loosing Mufasa and then livening up and picking up their naughtiness was actually fun to watch!  Laughing thinking about her trying to take out the drones!!  You had your hands full for sure and they turned out to be such a special pride. She will be missed dearly. Big hugs to you and everyone at the sanctuary for the wonderful jobs you do making sure these beautiful animals are loved and taken care of.  Thank you for sharing all your babies with us! ü•∞"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I'll always think of her as Livy, the instigator. Her naughtiness was infectious and we love her for it. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"So sorry about Livvy. She was always fun to watch, always up to something üò¢"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Dear Kevin,
I am so sorry about Livy dying and wish to extend my condolences to you and your staff...üôè
The lady who did the post mortem really said it best when she said that Livy was the happiest lioness that she has seen... ‚ù§
And you were a big part of her happiness üëçüëçüëèüôÇ"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,God Bless Livy and praise to Kevin for giving her a wonderful safe and happy life. ‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Thank you so much! I was expecting to see them for a long time! I am so happy to see that they are well and get along so well also. I hope you are feeling better, please update us.ü¶Å‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Livy will be missed, one of the favourites absolutely. So naughty and yet so sweet and full of life, rest in peace wonderful Livy."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I'm so sorry to hear about Livy. She was an incredible, loving, beautiful lioness. She will always be in our hearts and she will definitely be missed ‚ù§‚ù§  It is wonderful seeing Ginny and Vayetse. I know all of the lions miss her. Thank you Kevin for sharing these beautiful videos. I'm always looking forward to Fridays."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Always nice to see you Kevin. I am sorry you guys lost Livy. May her spirit live on. Lots of love to you and the Lions. Thank you for all you do Kevin.  ‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I think that it was really beautiful how the video didn‚Äôt focus so much on the loss of sweet Livvy, but let her legacy be the pride in which she lived. They say that if you truly want to know who someone is, you look at the ones around them. She was surrounded with love and joy and contentment. That‚Äôs who she was, and she lives on through those qualities of her pride."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I always get a lift from seeing you with your wonderful lions and your ability to move forward after the loss of your loved ones but that's a part of life unfortunately, power to you Kevin for the good that you do and the education you give to us thank you for all that you do, from an admirer of someone who appreciates such dedication and wonderful insights into the lives of such majestic creatures, thank you.üôÇüò∏‚ù§üëçüéÖ‚òÆ"

15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Thank you Kevin for all you do to make these wonderful animals lives the best they can be.  I'm so sorry for your loss but we know you made her life the best it could possibly be and we appreciate you for that!!  We are forever grateful for you and all of your knowledge.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sad to hear this news! It‚Äôs always hard to lose loved ones! It looks like they‚Äôre transitioning well. I love this pride! Rip Livy! üíï
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Livy helped play a role in that she showed us how wonderful these beautiful cats can be and are.  Thank you for sharing your life with us Livy thru Kevin's camera!!!
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,My condolences. Every one of those lions are magnificent creatures. It's always horrible every time you lose one.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I could never get enough of the head butts! Omgosh it's one of my favorite things my tuxedo house cat does! üòªüòªüòª
Thanks for a lovely tribute to Livvy. I'm sure she's watching over everyone from top of the rainbow Bridge! üåà üíóüòª"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,It's always sad to hear when a lion passes. Livy will be missed for sure.  We know how much love and affection you give to all the animals in your sanctuary. And I believe they know they're loved. Thank you for doing the amazing work you do for such majestic animals. God bless you Kevin!
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I'm sorry to hear of the passing of Lioness Livy. I always feel sad when one of Kevin's Lions passes away. Kevin gave her a wonderful life and she was happy so that was a great gift to her. And she was a gift to Kevin and us fans around the world as well.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I can watch the interaction you have with these gorgeous creatures all day long! Rest easy, beautiful Livy.üòî"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,So sorry of Livy's passing. She had the best care and life a lioness could have. Thank you Kevin ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,It amazes me that Kevin is still alive. He's a truly interesting brother.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I'm so sorry to hear about Livy. I know it broke your heart. She was a lovely lady and I know you miss her. Hugs to you and the staff, and hope your recovery is swift and uneventful. <3"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,It‚Äôs amazing the relationship you have with these lions! Sorry for your loss and RIP Livy.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you lost one of your lions. I watch your videos and I know how dedicated you are to these animals. Must be very hard to miss them
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I always admire what you do for these lions, Kevin.
I wonder where you bury them when they pass away, are they marked or have headstones? Very curious about that since they have such remarkable relationships with you."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Your tribute to Livy was very touching. It‚Äôs also sad to lose a family member. She lived a wonderful life in your care. ‚ù§‚ù§üôèüèªüôèüèª

15,aqd_CBZEd8U,aw... my heart is broken.   Livy was such a beautiful girl....  i am so very sorry for your loss...  üíî
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"So sad to lose Livy, she was so beautiful, brought a tear to my eye, such a great lioness."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,RIP Livviüíî Thank you Kev for all you share with us.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"üò™ So sad to hear of Livvy's passing - I always enjoyed watching the three amble about on walks - I do wonder if Ginny and Vayetse look for Livvy or do they simply live in the moment? Vayetse seems so  ""contented"" with Ginny --I'm sure he thoroughly basks in Kev's attention - how great is that, to be able to give a lion a ""belly-rub""!!!!!!!!!‚ù£"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I'm sorry to hear of LIvy's passing, but I just lost one of my cats to a similar thing.  In this case, it is my opinion that faster and unexpected is better than a long drawn out battle that cannot be won and that inflicts suffering on the animal and the owner/carer.  My Tommy was only 4-5 days from first mildly obvious symptom to gone."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"How she could see in Livvy‚Äôs body that she was a happy soul I can‚Äôt understand, but I sure do believe it‚ù§‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,RIP Livy. Thank you for always taking the best care of her. She is now united with her ancestors and no pain can harm her anymore.‚ù§
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Sincerest condolences Kevin, i will truly miss her in the videos. Thoughts and pryers with you.‚ù§"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Rip Livy, you amazing being. Thank you for coming in this world and making it a better place ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"I love how you played prankster with Ginny. She's lost someone to rough house with.
Livy was one of my favorites. The super model as she was so gorgeous."
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"What a wonderful tribute ! Life is a treat that Livy savored and shared with you, Vayetse and Ginny, with infectious pleasure. Beautiful and amazing Livy, you may be gone but you will forever be in our thoughts and in our hearts. Rest In Peace Gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏èLivy ‚ù§Ô∏è!"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"RIP Livy!! 
Thank you for leaving such a beautiful legacy we should all take note of her beautiful spirit and heart. She was an inspiration to all.!!! Xxoo"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Kevin, we are also sad for the loss of Livy. I have questions about how the lions experience the loss. I hope this is not in bad taste, but I am curious.  Do you just take the sick lions away and they don't return, or do you bring the body back so the pride can see that one of them has passed like it happens in the wild? Either way, do you notice that the other cats sense the loss? Do they get sad or depressed? Can you also make a video on that? Maybe other people are curious to know as well? Thank you for all you do. :o)"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Livy and Amy are causing havoc up in heaven together bringing joy and laughter to everyone they come in contact with.
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,Absolutely wonderful creatures. Thank you for taking such good care of them!
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Rest in peace Livi, you were a wonderful ambassador of your species.  You indeed brought many smiles to thousands of people.  We love you!"
15,aqd_CBZEd8U,"Livy was so loved and she lived a happy, peaceful kitty life ‚ô•Ô∏è"

15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"As a nurse to humans, I *can not* stress enough the importance of having your supplies ready beforehand, better to be over prepared than in the middle of a procedure and needing something. Especially if you're the only one there, besides the patient, or in this case, a cat.üòÅ"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"What a glorious day it will be when Chouchou can finally eat food all by himself.

Hannah is such an amazing human. Imagine what our world would be like if everyone had even half the compassion she has."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I‚Äôm so glad to hear he finally got his cleft palate surgery! I hope his recovery goes smoothly
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"2:26 My Loki also found his voice when I had to tube feed him! He‚Äôs been so chatty ever since. He was also a recovering feral kitten before that and tube feeding strengthened our bond tremendously. Obviously I wish no cat would ever have a need to be tube fed, but for anyone out there who just learned they need to start doing this for their injured cat, I assure you it isn‚Äôt as scary / overwhelming as it might seem. Your relationship with your cat will almost certainly improve if you are patient and affectionate during the feeding process.
And a tip for the less patient (like those with ADHD/EFDD), find a 30 minute podcast or something to listen to while you do it if you fear you may grow restless during the feeding process. Never try to speed it up to finish quicker.
I‚Äôm so grateful to the Kitten Lady for posting this video & sharing best practices with loving (possibly terrified but incredibly dedicated) cat parents! ‚ô°"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He‚Äôs just so adorable.I wonder if he‚Äôs so compliant, because he‚Äôs used to getting fed by hand.
I‚Äôve syringe fed my sweet girl orally, and she was soooo good at it too, but she was a just generally an easy going cat."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,So happy to see this update on Chou Chou!  Glad to see he was able to have surgery to fix his cleft palate!  Hope his recovery goes smoothly and the surgery was successful üôèüôèüôè
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,So happy to learn that he was finally able to get his surgery. Hoping for a smooth and successful recovery for the cutie pie. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He got so big, not a little dandelion puff anymore! So glad to hear he got his surgery. Thanks for sharing about him!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I‚Äôm so proud of his progress!! It felt like just yesterday you made us aware of his cleft palate and the daunting task of getting him big enough for his surgery. Now look at this man‚Äôs, absolutely a trooper both you and him! ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I feel so sorry for Chou, this looks so uncomfortable, even imagining he has a tube in his neck makes me almost cry. But I know it‚Äôs necessary and he‚Äôs such a brave boy for taking it all so well. I hope he recovers soon and gets to live a happy life because he‚Äôs such a sweet soul that deserves it"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,it‚Äôs so delightful to see chou chou meowing and batting at toys even as he‚Äôs recovering from surgery. thank you for all the work you do!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Aww, Chouchou, his little squeaks are so adorable! I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs recovering well, and has such competent and loving care. I look forward to the video of you showing him tuck his smooshy little face into a bowl of yums."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,So good to see Chou Chou progressing! Sweet little guy.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Good job with the tube feeding. He was so good. I had human patients who acted up more than he did. Good boy. ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"When you were getting ready to feed him, Chouchou was leaning back and I wonder if he was waiting for his hydrated, flattened pellets. üòÄ He remembers how he used to eat. His tiny meows though...I have to watch that part on repeat because it is SO cute! Great job Chouchou! You are doing so well on the e-tube and soon, you will get to learn how to eat with your mouth. It will take some getting used to but I am confident you will be eating like a pro in no time! üòò"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,What a lucky cat to find you out of anyone else in the world. That cat really hit the jackpot finding you ü•∞
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I fed my cat Kali with an e-tube for quite when she got too sick to eat or drink!!! Thankfully she made a full recovery and she‚Äôs back to being as well-fed as ever!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Such a sweet baby. Him and Ferguson are always melting my heart. ü•∞
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,So happy he has had his surgery and is recovering well!  Looking forward to seeing him learn to eat by himself and be able to taste his food and let you know what he does and doesn't like!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Aww, look how well he is doing! Love this little marshmallow cloud! ‚òÅÔ∏è"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He is so well behaved and that meowing is to cute! You're doing a great job with him!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Aah!  Well done Hannah!  Your love and patience is slowly rewarding you.  We can all see how much Chouchou adores you,  he even meowed at/for you. Your videos bring so much heartiness to us!  Thank you.‚ù§"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Aw! Chou Chou is so cute! I love him so much you should make more videos of him!üíï
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Chouchou‚Äôs little e-tube bandana‚Äôs are the cutest! He looks like a little kitty cowboy ü§†
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Thank you for not only your time and ‚ù§... but expense to help Chouchou live a happy life üêà‚Äç‚¨õ purr... meow... head bonk on leg
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Love this! This is far more descriptive than the training we received from our vet when we first dealt with an e-tube, which meant that we learned from struggling through issues and advice we found online. I wish we‚Äôd had this video!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He is SUCH a good boy - you can tell he's used to this routine.  You've done amazing things for this sweet boy.  <3
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Thanks for the information the cat is such a beauty üòªüêæ
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I was wondering last night how Chouchou was doing!  Glad to know he's had the surgery and is healing well!  He's such a good fuzzy!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I was on tube feeding for a long time. It is amazing and very admirable to see how much care and love you pour into the healthcare of your cats, foster or otherwise! 

Whilst I don't know if cats have the same nerve endings as humans, one thing I will suggest from my own experience is - try to use warm water for flushings! It's a strange thing, but I noticed when I pushed cold water in, I would feel it like a trickle of cold water down my oesophagus. It was uncomfortable and nauseating, so body-temp warm water helps! It's so good you're doing it slowly too. That helps a lot. Thank you for sharing this educational video, and I hope Chouchou recovers quickly!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I am so happy he had his surgery. ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"My little dog had an e-tube for two weeks after he was attacked by a German Shepherd. It was emotionally difficult, but the process was easy. Make sure to get the Christmas tree back in the tube tightly."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He is such a gorgeous kitty, I am glad he has had his surgery and I hope his recovery is speedy and smooth ‚ù§Ô∏è üíñ üíô üíó"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"OMG love seeing him thriving so well. He is a lucky guy! We  are lucky to have heard him meow, super adorable."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Oh my his little meow is so cute! The look of shock on your face was great! lol. I'm so happy he is doing better and healing so well! Can't wait for him to eat his first meal via his mouth and new palate!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He's gotten so big!!  

Can't wait to see him being able to enjoy eating on his own."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Thank you so much for showing how to do this! I‚Äôve been on the verge of using a feeding tube in the past, but thankfully not yet! It‚Äôs great to see such good visual instructions! üòª‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"The Kitty Kollars were a godsend when our young cat had an e-tube placed in an emergency.  The alternative is a high level of skill with nonstick bandages and adhesive wrap, which all has to be redone every time you feed. We used two of the ""kollars"" so one could be washed while the other was in use- super easy.  Our young cat figured out in 3 feedings that, when we sat down together in the particular feeding spot and went through all this wackiness with the syringes, suddenly his hunger would go away!  

His feeding tube was much longer than Chouchou's, which wasn't good. He broke the ""Christmas tree"" attachment twice (shattered the plastic) by whacking it on the floor. The second time, he also tore out all of the stitches securing the tube to his neck, which was a real problem since he did this on the first day of the 2021 winter storm in Texas.  Huge shout-out to the emergency vet techs who helped us despite no power, no water, half staff, snow everywhere.  

Also, you would not believe the mess created when you try to get an air bubble out of the food syringe while pointing the tip UP at the ceiling. Good grief."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,My cat had one of these during her final 2-3 months. Definitely requires a lot of patience. Unfortunately she never ended up eating on her own again.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I adore Hannah's reaction at the meow! ‚ù§üí•
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"before watching your videos I never even considered fostering kittens but after seeing a few of your videos on how to help these little babies I was able to help 16 different cats! One did end up passing away mostly due to a miscommunication with the shelter but 15 out of 16 is a really good number! When I first clicked on this video I thought ""I could never do that"" But after you showed yourself doing it calmly and easily I feel like I could too! Your videos helped me feel empowered enough to take on the hard job of fostering because you make it less scary. Thank you for making these videos and thank you for making videos talking about the sad part and the yucky part and the funny part. You have saved so many kittens personally but because of your videos and books thousands of cats and kittens have been saved by people who never would have tried without your inspiration. Thank you for what you do."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,What a great system you have in place with him.  He‚Äôs such a cutie pie.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He was remarkably calm. 

My cat would die of starvation before letting me do any part of this ü§£"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I have never seen an E tube so this is so amazing to me thank you so much for all of these videos! Chouchou looks great for just having surgery.  I really appreciate your love and dedication for these precious kitties!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Oh I hope he heals well, he's so cuteü•∞"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Chouchou has gotten so big. Good to know that Chouchou had the surgery. It's going to take multiple surgeries, isn't it?"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He's doing so so good with his e tube. He looks healthy and happy and that little meow!!! It's the first time I heard him meow too so adorable.  I'm looking forward to seeing the fully healed palette end of month.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He‚Äôs huge!  And what a sweet meow!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"It's so relieving to hear that little Chouchou could get his palate surgery. And I'm so super thankful for humans like you, giving cats like him a chance for a happy life! üíï Though I also wish you could take a minute in EVERY video that shows Chouchou to inform your viewers about the suffering caused by breeding deformities into cats. Persians may look cute and fluffy but sooo many of them have severe health problems throughout their whole life. Please everyone, don't support cat breeders!! üôè"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,So happy that Chouchou is adapting to the e-tube this time unlike about 4-5 months ago when his body rejected the tube.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"It's down to a science! ChouChou is in perfect hands, too! He's such a sweet baby! 
Thanks for the update Andrew & Hannah!!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Chouchou is big strong furry baby, so in love with him.  Hannah, you're a Goddess üíï"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"My heart. How precious. He is such a champion, taking all of this in stride. I can't wait to see his full recovery. Go, Chou! Great job, Hannah."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,This is pretty similar to what I do for my human kid. He has a g-tube and has been tube-fed since he was an infant.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,haha it's so beautiful to see how they play they look so cute at the same time it makes life worth seeing that there are beings that deserve to be cared for with love ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I love watching how you take such good care of ur kitties! The informational videos have taught me a lot ‚ù£Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,The cutie muppet looks adorable I‚Äôm so proud of him and how far he‚Äôs come omg ‚ù§
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Amazing that he is so calm and patient, my cats cant sit still for 5 minutes üòÆ"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,ChouChou got so big!!  I'm so glad he could finally have the surgery.  I'm sure he'll be gobbling down his food like every other cat in a few short weeks! ‚ù§
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Such a good kitty! I hope he heals quickly and continues to have a wonderful life ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"He's such a big boy now! ü•π 
I remember when you first shared him with us, he was so tiny!
Good luck, Chu! We're all cheering for you here ü§ó"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,OMG he grew so much! So happy to hear he finally got surgery and on the road to recovery. Can't wait to see him finally eating on his own <3
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I‚Äôm so happy he‚Äôs doing well ‚ù§ Our entire family has been keeping track of him and we update each other. He‚Äôs a perfect boy. üòä
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Thank you for the update on Chouchou. I was wondering if I'd see him again. So glad he had his surgery.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,My favorite part was your reaction to Chouchou meowing at you <3 so cute <3
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He is just so trusting and sweet.  And that tiny meow‚Ä¶.swoon!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Chouchou has gotten so big! So glad he's had his surgery and is doing well. üòä
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He‚Äôs such a good sweet patient. ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,You're such a good boy Chou Chou! I wish you a safe and secure recovery sweetheart. Thanks Hannah for spreading all your kittyknowledge. ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Chou Chou is my favorite Jim Henson creation ü•∞ but seriously to see him thriving and healthy post operation is heartening. Thank you Hannah, Yige and Andrew! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Chouchou will have a whole new world open up when able to eat normally.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I love him so much! I have a feeding tube also so I can relate to him, lol."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,CHOUCHOU GOT SURGERY OMG YAY!! Hoping for a speedy recovery!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Good job, Chouchou!!  You're in such good hands, you're gonna heal up like a champ!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He is such a gorgeous and patient Kitty. Thank you so much for this informative video.  Looking forward to seeing him eat by mouth as nature intended. :-)
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,What a trooper!! üíúüíúüíú Good job Chou Chouüò∏
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Good thing that he finally got his cleft palate fixed! üê±He is a beautiful cat, and you are a beautiful soul.....! üíñüêæ"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Well done Chouchou, I'm happy it is only a month, but good to see that Chou is getting everything he needs and he is doing well."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I‚Äôm so emotionally invested in ChouChou üíó
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Cutest cat ever üòçü•∞ I still remember when he was a little tiny chuchu
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Omg he‚Äôs so big üò≠ im so happy to see him doing well! ‚ù§
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,he seems to tolerate the feeding very well. amazing job.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Congratulations on the surgery, Chouchou! I wish you a speedy recovery!

Is it going to be complicated teaching him how to eat with his new mouth? My human baby had a tongue and lip tie release and she's had some challenges learning to do oral motor stuff she used to be physically incapable of."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I cannot WAIT until this little guy is healthy and fully healed.  It's important for people to see this, though -- brachycephalic cats can be popular sometimes, and people need to realize that it's not healthy and can result in a kitty having to go through all this difficulty."
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I look forward to seeing Chouchou fully recovered from his surgery.
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,You two are so patient with each other. ‚ù§
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,How patient both Hanna and ChouChou are! Thank you!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"When I saw the thumbnail, I thought, ""Oh, no! What's gone wrong for poor ChouChou now?"" üòü

But then I find out he's had his surgery, and will be learning how to eat for himself soon. üòåü•∞

Unfortunately, I notice he's making sounds while he's breathing, which is NEVER good in a brachy breed. I hope closing the cleft palate didn't inadvertently take away a source of supplemental oxygen from him. ChouChou has such a tiny little nose. Please tell me this is just residual swelling from the surgery that will subside in time. üôÅ

I wonder if some genius could design a device that allows humans to what experience BOAS feels like for brachy breeds, so then we could challenge all proponents of breeding French bulldogs and peke-nosed Persians to wear this apparatus for 24 hours while going about their ordinary everyday activities. Just one day of this should be enough to make at least some of them question the wisdom of ""adhering to the breed standard"" and handwaving snorts and snuffling away as ""just characteristic of the breed"". One day.

Hey, I can dream, can't I?"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"ChouChou: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs doing back there, but my tummy is full after. I feel goooood.*purrrrr*‚Äù
ü§çüêæü§çüêæ"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Wow! He's so chill! My cats would never sit that long...
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,I am glad that he is progressing!!!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Love him so much! Little fighter and the cutest cloud üåßÔ∏è in the world
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Chouchou is so sweet, your made a miracle by raising him! Wish the very best for this sweet guy!"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,OH MY GOSH HES GROWN UP SO MUCH SINCE LAST TIME I SAW HIM! AAAA HES SO PRECIOUS!
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,Such beautiful eyes on Chouchou! Get well soon buddy :)
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"Aw, such precious meows ^^"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,"I thank you so much for your love and care for this kitty, you are such a beautiful person inside and out, hope kitty gets full recovery, with love and GOD bless your life üíïüôè"
15,Y9bpfeR9lv0,He is gorgeous and a sweet boy I laughed when he meowed at you
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"The way he sleeps on her shoulder, just like real kids. That is so adorable. Chase looks so peaceful sleeping/laying on her at the end. Too cute!!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,This is why Chase is my most favorite of the three‚Ä¶. He is Purrrrrrrfectly adorable
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase is almost like a kid, he loves to hug and give kisses why mess up a good thing! üòÄ Chase is sooo adorable, Kareem and Fifi are so lucky to have such a smart and loving kitty cat!! üòΩüòªüòªüòª"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,A cat like Chase is better than having a kid....he's even more obedient than a kid ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçü•∞
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,He is so ADORABLE!  Look how he lays his little head on your chest just like a human baby!!‚ù§Ô∏è true love
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Kids make you blood pressure go up...cats make you blood pressure go down(proven medical fact. )
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,If I had that type of cat like chase ofc . He's purrrfect
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I totally agree! You also never have  to pay for college, buy them a car, worry about them getting in trouble at school, god forbid doing drugs or ending up in jail. 
Its so much easier!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Hahah as a man who is a cat lover and they are for me like my babies , I totally agree with you and Chase is super gorgeous amazing and majestically beautiful and cute , love him with all my heart üòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòòüòòüòò"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Plus you never have the expense of college tuition for your cat.  I love you, Chase!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase was extra whiny today!
I love him. Also it‚Äôs not said enough, his humans are super cute and treat their kitties well üòä"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase: You told me to get no so  I'm going to stay on and never leave you again ü•∞ü•∫üòà
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Aww, I agree! Baby chase is just so adorable! All the love! üíï"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,This is the PREFECT explanation given to NOT HAVE KIDS!!!! THANK YOU!!!üíñüíñüíñ
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Ur kids are adorableüòÇ
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"They r the best medicine I when u sad, when u sick. They just bring so much comfort and smiles."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I can relate to that, having a child or getting a pet is an interpersonal choice that will effect your life in different ways but still involves you taking care of another.

That doesn't mean I'm saying that there's no difference in having a child or a pet (How dare I if I thought it that way), I'm just saying that either choice teaches you to be responsible in caring for the well-being of another life.

So do as you want but live up to the choice to the fullest, folks."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase should get his own star on the Hollywood walk of fameüòÜ
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I want him so much! You have the sweetest family.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Love that Chase, he knows exactly what he's  doing to bribe Mommy for a treat!!!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase is definitely  your child. Another  bonus, you don't  have  to  pay for college! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,You are absolutely right. The cats give you all the unconditional love that you need.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,So cute Chase!! I love how near the end he's sleeping on her so cute ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Oh, don't pay attention to what people say about how you live your life.  Pets are people with different forms and way of being. JUST DO WHAT MAKE YOU HAPPY üôèüí´üåøüí•"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I have a cat, I may be a child myself but she is sassy, clingy, lively, and reminds me if a toddler lol she's a difficult child ü•≤"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Technically you're not bribing him, you're threatening the withdrawal of something. Bribing would be offering a treat if he does it. I saw those ears, and I think Chase knows the difference as well!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I've been blessed with fur babies since I was younger. Cat's are a blessing from the Creator. Wish you a merry Christmas and a better new years than this year. God bless Praise Jesus
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"When she talked about the cat litter, I felt that."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase is soooo adorable....as a kiddo, too.. üêæüòÆ"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I have 3 cats! Retired Special Education teacher here! 37 years, 31 at the Preschool level! Cats are much easier! They don't do drugs, they don't wear expense sneakers, they can't get pregnant all are fixed/ neutered , the make great bed warmers in the winter, just a few of the many reasons I have cats instead of kids!

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Too many humans in the world‚Ä¶ but you can never have too many cats.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase is far cuter than any biped I've ever seen.  And smarter too.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Finally someone understands, btw I think Chase is just being difficult because of the camera üì∏"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase is so darn cute and smart...lmao  Niceee and a hell of a lot easier to take care of. Lol
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,They are your kids!!! Don‚Äôt let no tell you different you guys are adorable ü•∞ ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"No!  They're BETTER and MORE FUN!  They're smart, they know what you say, and no diapers to change!!!  Babies/kids outgrow their clothes and shoes.  Cats' clothes grow with them and NO shoes needed!!  üëç‚ù§Ô∏è  üòÑüòÜüòÖüòÇü§£"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I have 2 kids and 2 cats......the 2 cats are my stress relievers that I need to keep going as a parent. They go poop with me, they pet me while my kids scream & fight while I‚Äôm trying to take a relaxing dump. I make dinner and I get strokes from my cats while I cook dinner while my kids fight in the background. I help with school work and my cats lay on the school work while my kids run away from doing the work. Yeah, cats are the meow I need in my life as they make the stress of life more at ease and funny. We can‚Äôt do this assignment tonight kids, the cats are sitting on it, tell your teacher what happened tomorrow. üòÇ
Edit:By the way I couldn‚Äôt wrap your Christmas presents either because the cats plopped onto the gift wrap.....I was done at that point and started petting on the cats. Here kitty kitty, would you like this Amazon box to jump in? 2 hours later.... I wrapped one gift. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Kitty!!!!! Get out of the tree!!!! üå≤ üêà‚Äç‚¨õ 
Christmas is always special with your loved ones but it‚Äôs really special when you have cats that love it as much as you do. 
I love redecorating a tree 10 times in a 1 month time span. Yes, let‚Äôs put up that tree said a non cat owner. 
Cat tree owner:I‚Äôve got puss n boots wide eyed black kitty cat eyes ready for the take down.
Yes, have some! (Ghost Busters quote there)
Unwrapping gifts is the best also, they‚Äôre always right there to hop into the boxes and play with the gift wrap, bows, and elastic ties. 
Here kitty, let‚Äôs sprinkle some catnip in there while we put these darn toys together. (Needing much entertainment)
Cats: During the holidays they make everything Merry and bright. Go getcho self one. Tis the season to be Meowee! 
Appreciate your cats this holiday season and let them be cats. It‚Äôs not a tree unless it‚Äôs been taken down and redecorated a handful of times. Understanding this season is about the nativity of Jesus‚Äôs birth and your cats might be a nega-tivity. Let it go, and enjoy it. They only get to be this rotten once a year. Merry Christmas to all and to all who have cats a sleepless night. Many nights. Just be glad you didn‚Äôt have cats during the 80‚Äôs because those styrofoam ornaments wrapped in yarn üß∂ were taken all off of the tree each day. 
Long time cat lover who knows. JS"

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Very beautiful. Lovable cat.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"If a kid got you over 2.5M subscribers, you'd have some. üòâ"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"kids are not fun. cats love you unconditionally and NEVER make you wish you never had them. cats never say horrible things to you or make you wish you would just die, already."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Our pets really are like having kids‚Ä¶lol
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I love cats and you make great points and I love how you guys are such great pet parents I enjoy your videos thank you so much
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase at the end sleeping on you. I love him so much such a cute baby
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Cute video..but, There is no way I can explain the love you feel for your child...until you have one- it overwhelming 
( you don't know until you know)"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Right when he was being very clingy my cat was doing the same thing‚ù§Ô∏è
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Agreed. I adore my Birman cat but he is hard work and so demanding.

7.30am ‚ÄúBreakfast! Feed me. I‚Äôm not going to stop crying until you do‚Äù. 

8am. ‚ÄúUnless you want me to crap on the floor, you‚Äôll clean my litter tray NOW‚Äù

11am. 
‚Äú Treat time and I‚Äôm waiting at the kitchen cupboard door where I know they are kept‚Äù.

1pm. ‚ÄúLunch time. Don‚Äôt give me fish. Yesterday I wanted fish. Today I want chicken‚Äù. Geese!

2pm to 3pm
Annoying mum time.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs sewing. Let‚Äôs knock pins off table. Jump up at the thread.  Knock the roll of thread üßµoff table and push it beneath sofa‚Äù Watch whilst, clearly agitated, she looks for thread. Great fun. What can I do next?

4pm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm standing at the treat drawer. No luck, let‚Äôs rub my face against her legs and purr until she caves in‚Äù. Always worksüò∏

5pm ‚ÄúLap time‚Äù. I know my mum needs the loo but she won‚Äôt move to disturb me. She will suffer until I‚Äôm ready to let her go. Go on, off you go. I‚Äôve been kind. Only made her wait an hour today but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs 

 6pm and Dinner Time!

Dry food? Ok I‚Äôll eat the dry food so long as you give me wet food also. Look here‚Äôs the cupboard where you keep my wet food. I‚Äôll just stand here until you understandShe‚Äôs got it. Now just ensure it‚Äôs meat!

7pm
Whose coming through the door? My dad and he‚Äôs a real sucker!
What‚Äôs he got on that plate? Cabbage, no. Carrots, no. Potato. Yes I like that and also a huge pork chop! Let‚Äôs go to work. Meow and blink my blue eyes. Put my paw on his knee and rub my head on his thigh. Roll around on the floor and then lay across his feet. Here it comes. A lovely piece of juicy meat and some potato. 

Stand by treat drawer and as mum shouts ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give him anymore treats‚Äù. He winks his eye and slips me a few. Told you he was a sucker. üòΩ

Rest of evening snuggles up with mum and dad on Sofa being stroked and petted. Lovely.

Bedtime. 
Kiss them both Goodnight right after giving my arse a good licking!

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I couldn't have children because I had endometriosis.  I have had some sweet kitties in my life. one even saved my life when my heart rate went to 30per min when I was on a monitor at home. He was a Himalayan kitty.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Your 100% right! I wish more people would think like you üòâ
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"""WHY WOULD I WANT A KID IF IT WOULD COST ME MORE!!""

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,No complaints when I leave the cat at home for a weekend camping trip.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I have never seen such a cute cat like Chase üòç
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I wish my cat would hug me like thatü•∫üò≠
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I ‚ù§Ô∏è Chase. He's so unique. üòª

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Cause there is nothing sweeter than seeing your fur baby and human baby bond. Lol but no, fur babies are def just as beloved as human babies, and Chase is as close to one as you can get! And boy are you an amazing mommy!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase's little paw and pudgies üòÇüòçü•∞
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Awwwww I like he just snoozes on her while she discusses diapers. My girls are my babies too. I love my meow meows.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Cats are the best kind of kids to have üíñ
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase is so cute he's definitely a little baby out of his two sisters
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Pets were absolutely adorable and stress reliever,they're literally like ur children already...but still human kids would still be good to hve,sooner or later,its still good to have kids bcus theres still some difference between a child and pet,hving child is indeed much more expensive and harder than hving a pet but it will be the most precious time u would hve..but thats just my own thinking that i want to share,its still ur own decision.."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Kids are smarter, grow older, bigger and you can talk to them more ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Yes cats are just so much fun

Kit kat!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Yes, cats are fun as I have 10 of them and they are the apples of my eyes, (and I don't have children either) but I very much doubt it that those furry babies will outlive me. Just that simple. I love them very much, make no mistake. I'm just saying that it's not the same."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"We agree with her though as we preferred animals and antique cars over babies and have never looked back.  Crazy world, awful schools to deal with now and everything so expensive when it comes to raising children."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase will never borrow the car & run up your credit card. You'll never have to worry about him falling in with the wrong crowd.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Hahaha.....you should have kids.
Your kids will love them like you do"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Yes why have kids when you have a cat, chase is so cute <3"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase is an awesome cat and your favorite son!
 And you don't have to pay for his college."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Chase said ""bribery is beautiful!""  üíïüíïüíïüò∏"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Awwwww‚ù§
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"You are 100% right! And cats can give more love too :) plus, if you leave your cat home and go to the store everything is ok. BUT, leave a kid at home and you go to jail"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Chase is so sweet üíú
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I have two kids and one cat and let me tell you the cat is much more fun and a lot cheaper and less stressful
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,And at the end he is already sleeping üò¥ ü•∞
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I wish my cat would love me like that.
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Indeed The more the merrier Plus you don't have to pay to send them to college ! üòªüòªüòª
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,ooooohhh my God I'm falling in love with Chase...... smart decision.... no kids adopt a cat!!!
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I just want to say, I agree with you haha"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,U‚Äôre damn right. One day the cat will grow up n give u grandkitten. They‚Äôll even take good care of u when u‚Äôre old
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I'd much rather have my cat than a baby! üòª
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,üòÇ I just got me and my kids a kitten and I swear she act just like them already üò≠ definitely spoil her too

15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"I can understand, I have three cat's, Minnu,TIGER and goldy."
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,Depends on people to people. No one force you. üôåüèªüëçüèª
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,"Much easier to have a cat, they are more loving more loyal, today's kids grow up to be ungrateful spoiled disloyal use drugs alcohol & get in so much trouble,all they bring is high stress, children( not all kids ,) are for distress,cats are loving they bring a calming effect,I love my cats as well!!"
15,gQ6aTBQZOeg,I don't want no dang kids!! But it is said that cats have the mentality of a 5 year old!! SMART!! üò∫‚ù§‚ù§

15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"It's so great to see Cerby running and playing like that, it's almost as if he still has 4 legs with how he zooms around"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,It's heartwarming to see Cerby Cerberus doing so well ü•∞ and making friends with Floofy
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,It‚Äôs good to see cerby back running with the others! Even w 3 legs he‚Äôs such a playful fox
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Cerby was zooming around so fast, I honestly forgot he's missing a leg until I saw it!

I'm glad he seems to still be having so much fun! I know animals tend to be really resilient about these sort of things, but it's still a pleasant surprise just HOW well he seems to be adjusting!"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Great to see these two having so much fun.
Cerberus is looking so fit & heathy. Well done Mikayla & SaveAFox ‚ô•"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Cerby is handling that missing leg SO well - way better than the other tripods at SAF!

And floofy was raised by almost every fox there while she was a baby; are there any foxes she doesn't get along with?"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,That‚Äôs fantastic! I know you guys weren‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôd get a friend.  I‚Äôm so pleased!
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"I'm so happy seeing Cerby all recovered and running in the snow! Your updates are the highlight of my entire week, thank you for what you do <3"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Awww. That's so sweet to see! He's so quick on three legs. And in the snow! Happy to see that they get along.
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"It's great that they're getting along so well. I've seen other videos of Cerberus playing so I new he was adapting well to the loss of one of his legs, but I am very impressed with how fast and nimbly he can run on just three legs."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"It‚Äôs just like when Sly and Flood were together as friends, I miss Sly"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Losing a leg isn't slowing Cerb down
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Just so adorable to see them playing.  Thank you Save a Fox for giving them such a good life.  Xüíöü¶ä
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"After seeing and hearing about how much pain Cerberus was in, it just warms my heart to see him running and playing like this.  No pain there."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"SaveAFox has an uncanny ability to turn out videos that are irresistibly upbeat. Thanks. Seeing Cerby running and playing without a care actually made me a little teary and whenever Floofala shows up, it's fun time. 
Mikayla caused all of this. What a wonderful woman."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Wow! It's amazing how fast he adapted to being a tripod. Good to see him and Floof happy ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,I'm glad Floof has a friend . They can kind of relate . She had hip problems and he has a leg issue . Match made in Heaven ?
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Dang Cerby motors around quick with only three legs. Does he realize that he can just lounge around and be served like a celebrity? Floofawa seems seems to have an attachment to him as well, might be a good idea to keep those two together. üíû"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,How cute they are chasing each other!! It's so nice to see them becoming friends. Have fun foxes üòÉ. Prayers and Wishes Lisa Hampton üòÉ
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,So cute and so hilarious.  Cerby is amazing -- just as fast and agile as any of them.  So happy for her.üß°üíõ

15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Good to see that Cerberus is enjoying life still even with three legs. Can't keep a good Fox down.
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"I'm super impressed how well Cerby is doing with his 3 legs. And Floofala doing what she does best, being friends with everyone ü§ç"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,I would guess Cerb was born with 3 legs the way he's moving around.  Love to see it.  What a happy accident this turned out to be.  Stay wonderful.  Thanks.
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Look at the happy floofs playing in the snow. too cute.
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Wow! Cerby is very agile. And I hope nothing happens to him the next time. Take good care of him.
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,I'm really amazed how quickly Cerberus recovered from the limb removal. Looks completely natural. Happy
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"It's so nice to see Cerberus is feeling alright now!
Also is it me or has it been a while since we've last seen Floofala?"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Glad to see Cerby is doing so well :D Despite only having 3 legs.. he's really quick too!
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Aww, does Cerby have a crush? It's great to see him doing so well after everything that's happened recently, and it is adorable to see them playing so happily with one another."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"That was so adorable! It does look like they are friends. When they got close chasing each other if they hated each other they'd have been attacking, good to see they're getting along. Cerby runs pretty fast for having 3 legs!"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,The crycile cerberus is here.ü¶ä Thank you for the amazing content and I whish you the best.ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è

It‚Äôs nice to see. I needed the smile. It‚Äôs a sad day for me. Have a good Friday."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"I just noticed the cruel irony of Cerberus‚Äôs condition.

Cerberus was a mythological 3 headed Dog, and Cerberus the Fox has 3 legs."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"You can hardly see Cerberus has only 3 legs! Amazing how fast he can run and turn. üòä
So glad he is doing so well. Nice that he has a girlfriend to play with. ü¶äü¶äü•∞"

15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Love seeing Floofala, she be a fav fox for me. One reason is that her fur morph is SnowGlow and I have a vixen myself who is also a SnowGlow fox. Plus for me it is a bit rare seeing ol Floof, loved the vids of her as a baby, she was pinküòä."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,What a cute pair. The way they run flat outü¶äü¶äü¶äü¶äü¶ä

15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"Cerberus is doing so well, he's so happy so great!"
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,Im so glad we have red foxes in Ohio now. They can prey on abundant canada geese and keep them in check. She had like 4 kitts.

15,fHHhi0I6w1g,"I remember Floo as a baby,   she was like a little puffy cloud."
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,I was expecting either of them to start laughing. Is that noise they make only for us?
15,fHHhi0I6w1g,How agile foxes are in snow and winter. I fall to the ground at the slightest bit of black ice.

15,aaqzPMOd_1g,How could you dislike this video ü•∞
15,aaqzPMOd_1g,Wow... This is soooo adorable üòçüòçüòç
15,aaqzPMOd_1g,"My favourite animal, they are so cute!!! I have a sloth onesie, mousepad and at world book day, I drew a sloth on a rock"
15,gGludGaPKag,"In case you didn't notice, the first hare escaped and survived. So it makes a score of 1-1. It proves that predator and prey both have their chances. So you can stop with your ""poor defenseless hare"". It has actually a very strong defense mecanism."
15,gGludGaPKag,0:56 that‚Äôs most adorable thing a pup could do.
15,gGludGaPKag,I never saw a hare standing and so efficient in running and changing directions. It's just amazing! Impressive!
15,gGludGaPKag,"1:18 To the guy that timed the music to the hare steps, your work doesn't go unnoticed man üëç"
15,gGludGaPKag,"I find the reflexes of the wolf at 2:03 fascinating. It took a split second for him to realize the change in direction. I had to slow down to 0.25 speed to be able to see how fast he reacted. Of course, the hare's agility is even more impressive."
15,gGludGaPKag,One rabbit is nowhere near enough food for an entire pack of wolves. That‚Äôs a hard life.
15,gGludGaPKag,"BBC: it's a HARE

My mind: it's just a tall RABBIT"
15,gGludGaPKag,"""They run at 60km/h""

Camera Man: Hold my beer"
15,gGludGaPKag,David Attenborough. Always a delight to watch his work.
15,gGludGaPKag,"The thing about both animals is that they can run and run and run as long as they want/need to. That first one was one gifted runner though, not many hares have the sheer raw speed to outclass a wolf like that one did."
15,gGludGaPKag,That rabbit was smart keeps changing directions to outrun them first time
15,gGludGaPKag,I like how they put in the growls of the wolves when they caught the hare. It's so primal :)
15,gGludGaPKag,"What a magnificent job this must be
Even amidst all its difficulties
Getting to film these animals
Must be mesmerising."
15,gGludGaPKag,Seeing pups howl is the most adorable thing on this earth. They are so cute following in mamas footsteps
15,gGludGaPKag,Wolf stamina is really something else. They can keep a chase going for a long time.
15,gGludGaPKag,That's the most beautiful hunt I've ever seen from the wild.
15,gGludGaPKag,"Arctic Hares are fantastic animals, he was at a great disadvantage here as the snow had melted and he had no camouflage and still was able to outrun and outmaneuver those Wolves."
15,gGludGaPKag,"I love wolves so much, they make me feel so free and wild"
15,gGludGaPKag,I know they‚Äôd kill me in like 5 minutes but damn they‚Äôre cute
15,gGludGaPKag,"Looks like someone was caught in a hare-y situation!

I'm so sorry."
15,gGludGaPKag,Idk why but I find it fascinating that the hare changes directions as soon as one of the predators gets close enough to almost catch it.
15,gGludGaPKag,"With every twist and turn, the hare runs every inch of the chase.  By dividing the work amongst the pack, taking turns to pick up the chase, each individual wolf will be running considerably less, the more there are in the pack.  Great footage."
15,gGludGaPKag,"Props to the camera person, thanks to them we are able to see this amazing footage"
15,gGludGaPKag,I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm a human and I can go to the grocery store when I get hungry.
15,gGludGaPKag,"That first hare was superhuman. Now I can see why the wolfs need to hunt in a pack.... they are much smarter, being strategic in catching their prey when in a pack."
15,gGludGaPKag,I think nature makes the pups so cute to ensure the parents won‚Äôt fail them
15,gGludGaPKag,Wow I really love the running race of a hare and a turtle and the wolvesüòçüòò
15,gGludGaPKag,"Their tiny howls are so cute..  
Precious little cubsüòÇ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
15,gGludGaPKag,Wolves are just amazing animals
15,gGludGaPKag,The first hare was able to outcast the wolf as it didn't look back at them and stood in fear and just it's fought for it's life üëèüëè
15,gGludGaPKag,0:56 My heart melted here üòÜ‚ù§Ô∏è
15,gGludGaPKag,1:17 why is nobody talking about the music syncing with the hare's footsteps?? It was legit so cool
15,gGludGaPKag,"‚ÄúI fear no man‚Äù
‚ÄúBut that thing‚Äù
*standing rabbit*

‚ÄúIt scares me.‚Äù"
15,gGludGaPKag,That hare is fast
15,gGludGaPKag,"The first hare deserved to escape, the speed .. I was cheering it on ü•≥"
15,gGludGaPKag,"I want that rabbit as a wide receiver, he‚Äôs got jukes"
15,gGludGaPKag,"You cannot but respect the amazing stamina of those wolves...no wonder their domesticated nephews get out of control so much, these animals need SPORTS if they can't hunt"
15,gGludGaPKag,"Congratulations to the first Hare for saving its life,so sad to the second one"
15,gGludGaPKag,Never have I ever seen something outrun  not just one wolf but 2. Not just that it juked them several times before escaping. Imagine living and telling all your friends about how you did it.
15,gGludGaPKag,Nature is Amazing!
15,gGludGaPKag,kudos to hairy for not giving up or freezing even with fox literally snapping at his tail and even when multi-wolf pack on his heels with zero chance of survival - the moral is if you never give up you have a 1 in 2 chance of making it alive till the next larger pack overwhelms you
15,gGludGaPKag,"They both have a God Level Stamina, Nobodys talking about that"
15,gGludGaPKag,When Messi easily gets past 2 defenders so the whole team gotta help defend üòÇ
15,gGludGaPKag,The way hare changed direction it appears to me like a soccer match and the ah players pass the ball . Salute to the immense stamina of hare and wolves ü§üüèªüëå
15,gGludGaPKag,"1:17 that standing hare really caught me off guard. I had a second of ""what am I watching, again?"""
15,gGludGaPKag,"S√≠!!!...hasta que por fin lo consiguieron, su perseverancia vali√≥ la pena."
15,gGludGaPKag,That's how fast i run from responsibilities.
15,gGludGaPKag,This was the most intense animal chase I've ever seen
15,gGludGaPKag,"I feel sad for that rabbit being chase, so wolves can have their meal, that rabbit looks so tired but that just life :'("
15,gGludGaPKag,Those baby wolves made my day
15,gGludGaPKag,Am i the only one who thinks the way the hare runs and dodges looks hilarious
15,gGludGaPKag,1:18 so is no one going to talk about the fact the music is in sync with its feet?
15,gGludGaPKag,Thank you so much for this kind of information
15,gGludGaPKag,"1:18 I don't know what freaks me more, the stand-up hare walking or the fact that music is perfectly synchronized to its steps..."
15,gGludGaPKag,Hare's running stamina is just so Beauty to watch
15,gGludGaPKag,Damn I wish that I had the same amount of stamina as a wolf or a hare
15,gGludGaPKag,"I was cheering for the first hare so hard. The second hare was older and slower, it was his/her time. Wolves have to eat too."
15,gGludGaPKag,"A magnificent beast, the Wolf üî•"
15,gGludGaPKag,I am surprised the wolves need a whole pack for this. One small stoat is actually enough!
15,gGludGaPKag,"Seeing wolves hunt a hare is so cool

My dog likes to chase rabbits on walks so what I do is when we see a rabbit on the road I say ‚ÄúLook bud‚Äù and he looks forward, sees the rabbit but he doesn‚Äôt start trying to run immediately, instead he just keeps walking, waiting for me, and as soon as I start running, he bolts forward

Of course, he doesn‚Äôt get off his leash or anything, he and I chase the rabbit until it goes into a yard or down a back alley, then we stop, sit for a second and take a breather

He likes to chase anything that‚Äôll run from him, and if he catches up, he doesn‚Äôt attack or anything, just jumps on and barks until you start running again so he can get another run going, even though he‚Äôs no bigger than the rabbits we chase and could probably get hurt by one of their kicks, he‚Äôd never catch one of those things, they‚Äôre way too fast for a little guy like him"
15,gGludGaPKag,"It's interesting to see how they're almost evenly matched for their environment. The wolves are obviously way larger and can take down the prey quickly, but the hare is smaller so it can turn on a dime without losing so much momentum whereas the wolves had to keep a somewhat slower pace to try and predict which way the hare would turn. At the very least, they both seemed to run at the same top speed"
15,gGludGaPKag,1:18 I like how the rabbit times its hops to the music
15,gGludGaPKag,"This for sure was epic 
More epic than most of hollywood movies out there"

15,gGludGaPKag,I find this kind of stuff so interesting it‚Äôs beautiful how wolves work together to help their family continue to grow
15,gGludGaPKag,I was really rooting for the wolfpack

15,gGludGaPKag,"I love Sir David Attenborough and his soft voice is perfect for narrating the wonderful wildlife stories he presents, with his knowledge gained from a lifetimes experience as the world's leader in all of nature (in my opinion).  He nails it every single time without fail and this is no exception.  It is hard not to feel for the arctic hare of course but all the wildlife on earth has to eat ... it was good to see the first one escape and to see that they do have this chance... the next hare however, was not so lucky.  This was fabulous to watch  ‚óï‚Äø‚óï"

15,-VflY-zJUe8,"I knew Chucky liked her dirt baths, but I did NOT know that was such a common trait. What are they doing? Removing/masking their scent? Is the dirt like a perfume? Do they just like ""this"" dirt because it's loose and easy to dig? Are they looking for seeds? They don't look like they're trying to build tunnels for a new home and the pot would be too small anyway. I am a bit puzzled as to what's driving them. --- Regardless, they are tremendously cute and fun to watch!"

15,-VflY-zJUe8,I can‚Äôt wait to live on the first floor/ house so I can bond with my wildlife friends. I live on the third floor so birds will stop by to eat and sleep.

15,mgn6G5JcPow,This criminals need to experience what it feels like when you are chased by a predator and the amount of pain and anxiety one goes through when you know there's no escape from the death
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"I think this may need some explaining. In the UK, there are two hare species, blue hares, also known as mountain hares and brown hares. You can hunt blue hares in the UK legally. However, you can only hunt blue hares with birds of prey or a gun, not a dog. Hunting with dogs in the UK is semi-illegal, but some animals, such as rabbits and foxes, can be hunted with up to two dogs. Packs of dogs cannot be used, unless you are ratting. So basically hare coursing is illegal, but technically under the hunting with dogs act, isn't illegal. Basically, they never really out right banned it.
Edit:
The reason I know the law is because A-I do a lot of conservation work. B- I do pest control and the removal of invasive species. I often use dogs, ferrets and even birds of prey to aid me in this-usually I hunt rabbits, grey squirrels, american mink, brown rats etc. Not foxes though or anything like that! However, hare occasionally do get chased by dogs or hawks and it can be very hard to prove whether or not it was an accident or intentional. I know the law as a means of explaining anything that could happen, were we to have an accident or if a working animal misidentifies quarry and goes after the wrong animal. I mean hares no harm.

Edit 2:
Here is something else. If you would like to hunt with a dog please get landowner permission first! Too many farmers are waking up to find people hunting on their land. Farmers do not mind if you want to remove agricultural pests such as rabbits, brown rats etc but please get written permission first. You can scare livestock, damage crops and negatively affect the farmer's livelihood. Please don't do this, respect the countryside and the people whose earnings rely on it."

Horrifyingly disgusting..."
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"PRIMITIVE MAN. 
 Millions of years of human evolution to go."
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"Moronic and apathetic policing is to blame for the continued popularity. Try using half a brain cell to come up with tactics a bit more subtle than approaching from miles away in a fluorescent jacket and marked police car with the lights on. And rather than locking a dog up for 24 hrs, try pressing charges on the owners."
15,mgn6G5JcPow,I wouldn't care much if the hares were everywhere and had to be hunted but their population dropped by so much and that's where the main issue is for me. I feel like people are missing that..also not to mention the way farmers are harassed over trying to stop this behavior.
15,mgn6G5JcPow,i live in canada n have never heard of this so called sport. it reminds me of fox hunting.glad the brit govt is making these types of things illegal

15,mgn6G5JcPow,Laws MUST be established to PUNISH these scumbags!!!  Let us cure their addiction with consequences.
15,mgn6G5JcPow,The law sucks.These farmers should have guns and permission to shoot any noticable bahaviour
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"They should just hunt the rodents that swarm

15,mgn6G5JcPow,I have a very strong objection to anyone murdering helpless animals. An ugly thing men do.

15,mgn6G5JcPow,"Predating on children is a crime, this isn't. Police need to concentrate on what's important"
15,mgn6G5JcPow,If its a sport how can it continue with no hares? In my mind its nature hares are prey they get hunted. Now the action of the humans deplorable. If this is how your sport works maybe it should go extinct.
15,mgn6G5JcPow,I eat rabbits they taste delicious especially smothered in gravy over rice. But there's no way I would ever harm them or any animal just for sport.. Killing a animal just for sport is inhumane in my opinion..
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"Sport killing
Enough said"
15,mgn6G5JcPow,Seems to me that these farmers need to ban together and do armed patrols around these fields and run these guys off...
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"Barbaric and sick! There‚Äôs no such thing as a respectable courser! They all set their dog or dogs on the hare and end result is it‚Äôs ragged to death while releasing a high pitched squeal or cry, something you never forget when you hear it! If the hare is still alive it‚Äôs often re-released to the dogs for another ‚Äòrun‚Äô"

15,mgn6G5JcPow,Looks like another good reason to have a 2nd Amendment  ! This wouldn't happen in America.
15,mgn6G5JcPow,"Just raise your own rabbits to release and hunt. Population problem solved. Ever heard the phrase they breed like rabbits? Ya... Rabbits breed quickly and have many babies.
The kids acting a fool.. Ya they need put in check by their elder hunters. They also should be required to eat what they hunt.
Only hunting on property with permission and trespassers get shot."
15,mgn6G5JcPow,You watched the documentary How an animal becomes more animal than an animal. Happy viewing.
15,mgn6G5JcPow,What about civil Police Cars ?
15,mgn6G5JcPow,Is this about protecting the rabbits or tax money there government can't collect from this form of gambling.

15,mgn6G5JcPow,The love their dogs and the trophy. No regard to the wildlife. Wont take long for the hares to bounce back with a break. There is a way to make it work for everyone. Was interesting to watch. Great video

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,It‚Äôs amazing how much work you and Gavin do each day taking care of the horses/donkeys and barn. My hat is off to you and your family‚ù§
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Buster is so adorable.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Gavin is doing and excellent job unloading manure and you also Joel feeding and taking blankets off the horses and letting them back out in the pastures. Joel did you restock your medicine cabinet where you keep all the medicine at for the horses? Donkey time how cute wearing your hat . Love your videos. I‚Äôll be watching for the next video.

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"It looks like you and Gavin got a lot done today, most of your chores are done, enjoy your evening"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,I like Rickie Waffle's suggestion  -  a donkey calendar and also featuring Joel and Gavin with Rocky and Buster .  The fan's will buy them up in a hurry.  It's too late in the year to prepare a 2023 calendar but I'm hoping you'll think about it for next year . Love your videos and hearing you both joking and Joel's little kid giggles . Thank you for taking us along for part of your day.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Buster in the hat was too darn cute! Love how he knew just how he wanted to wear it!

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Joel you can hurt your ribcage ,shoulder, neck or back pulling on those fence posts. We know this from personal experience and the pain can feel like a heart attack. It can stay with you for months. So next time, work smarter and use a fence post puller or chain and tractor or just dig it out further around before giving it a tug. Just advice from one who was once young and full of strength and is now old and full of wisdom."
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Hi to Joel and the crew at the stable! Always enjoy spending a few minutes of my day with you. Would be great to sit on the fence and watch in person. Have a great day. ü§∂üèªü¶ÅüéÑ

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Joel, I am just curious if you or any of the veggie boys and girls play a musical instrument? I am an old guitar player so I always ask this question. Also I used to run a wastewater treatment plant so I was responsible for dealing with the waste (manure) of a small city. Love your channel.~ulrich"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"I love the video where you inter act more with the donkeys  and horses ,I know it  takes away from work ,but its makes me happy also lunchtime"

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Hey Joel and Gavin. Do you recommend brushing horses in the winter. Just wondering cuz they have their winter coats on. Not talking about the blankets.

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,I love Buster's new look. But we gotta have the donkey dance.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"I was thinking about Buster's nice fur hat, and then you put your cap on him. I noticed he likes to wear his cap pulled low over his eyes. It made him look very cool."
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Not love, it's using 'elbow grease' as us Aussies call it LOL Buster rocks! The horses are majestic... as Gavin calls it. Just love them. Great video, Joel :)"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Awesome video.   I love your Dinkey dances too. Merry Christmas üéäüéÅüéÑ to you all.

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,they are well looked after
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Buster is such a sweetie ‚ù§‚ù§
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Joel your cold sounds like my husband‚Äôs right now ,with him outside 10 hours a day ."
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Can you explain to me Gavin‚Äôs relationship to the family or how he became a employee.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"OH SURE.   I watch this video, anticipating the climactic ending when Gavin asks the question of the day.  NO question of the day!
Now my evening is just ruined.  I will throw myself into a piece of apple crisp with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then take a small nap.  It doesn't seem possible that it is almost Christmas!"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Buster looks like a gangster meme that should say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs donkey time‚Äù
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Love the donkeys ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Gave a like for the sweet puppy!  üòç

15,d5qnwgf-2cg,you know joel I love watching you with all your and how much they love you
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Something funny happened. I was busy doing something and just listening you talk to Gavin. I thought you were talking to Gavin the horse. So, when Gavin the man answered, I snorted. Holy crap! 6 loads of crap? Hey, yeh. What happened to the swing your dad was building?"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,them donkeys are so cute
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Poor ole Buster standing out there naked with nothing but Joel‚Äôs hat on.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Oh I was grunting and pulling at that stake right along with ya
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Buster looked good in that hat!!!
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"I am still stunned by your grain supplier.
For the level customer you are, that order should be on a pallet, with shrink-wrap for travel, and loaded with a forklift by them into your trailer within 5 minutes of your arrival.
You are buying at a feedstore, aren't you?  Or is this some perverse PetPros?
(You do call the order in in advance, right?)"
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Careful pulling a stake out like that. You can hurt yourself. Sometimes that‚Äôs how hernias are created or even deep abdominal tears.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,An easy way to pull out fence posts use a man Jack handyman Jack with a small chain around it and pull it out just like raising up a car to change a tire
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Good to keep a roll of duct tape for those types of accidents....Gavin. Hopefully you had a spare pair to change into!!!
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,Fun video .thanks both of you.
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,What a great video
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"Good job removing the broken off T post, that is hard work."
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,"As much as the horses are out in the field, why do they poop in the stall when they come in for feeding? Doesn't seem like they're in that long."
15,d5qnwgf-2cg,I love the donkeys

15,UNroEwFxh6I,Props to this one bee holding the camera.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"It may sound funny, but they are quite peaceful and reasonable for an insect. I love how they didn't attack even though their natural enemy was already trespassing and waited until it made the first move. Purely defensive and non-violent to the end. Nice creatures."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"hornet: ""so you chose suicide huh?""
that one bee: ""not suicide... SACRIFICE"""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I like how the bees don‚Äôt attack unless they are 100% sure it‚Äôs a threat
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet; ‚Äúany last words?‚Äù 
The bee that died: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon‚Äùüêù"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,You forget that these creatures have wholly different lives then us. These documentaries are such eye openers.  The circle of life in the animal kingdom is brutal yet so fascinating
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Gotta love those bees. They are peaceful until you attack them. Then you quickly find out that you picked a fight with the wrong group.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Instant respect for both Yamaguchi and for his bees. They are both super patient!
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Bruh..Even japanese bees are polite
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt overpower me, bee‚Äù

Bee: ‚ÄúI know I can‚Äôt, but they can‚Äù"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,The bees: ‚Äùwait wait we will use the power of friendship
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I respect the way Japanese honeybees live. Japanese honey bees are a treasure of Japan.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet: ""You go straight to hell, sir!""
Bee: ""After you, sir."""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Respect for the bee who laid down its life for the greater good of the hive. ' The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'
15,UNroEwFxh6I,3:39 It's very eerie how the bees suddenly stop moving.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That‚Äôs crazy that Japanese bees are the only bees in the world that know that survival defense technique
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I really love nature. A single bee sacrifices it's life just to protect another thousand bees without a hint of ego.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Can we love the bees any more? That was fantastic, they hugged it to death."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Can we just take a moment and respect the fact that this dude is bee keeping without a bee suit.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"I never fear Japanese bees. They're quite good at ignoring people and going about their business.

The murder hornets suck... They'll chase you."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I laughed s√≥ hard when the dark souls music kicked in ü§£
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Wild how even Japanese bees have similar approaches to war as the Japanese people.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Fascinating. What a great bee teamwork I have seen. It has been discovered that American Honeybees do not have this power to defeat a Murder Hornet. Only Japanese Honeybees do.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"famous last words: ""For the hive"".         

-the bravest bee of them all"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Why was this cute to me, yet I have bee-o-phobia THIS looks cute?"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,These bees have definitely shown us that nature can sometimes have its own form of justice.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornets and wasps still send shivers down my spine, even if they do not attack"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"I like how the initial bees after the one was caught look around like ""So are we doing this?? Yes?? Get his ass!"""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"What a brave little bee to sacrifice herself, she really  knew she wasnt getting out of there alive. Much respect."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"The bees as soon as the hornet attacked:""Let's do this LEEEEEEEEEEROY JENKINS!"""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,bees are such magnificent insects!! what bravery for 1 or 2 bees to sacrifice themselves for the rest of the troops. absolutely outstanding teamwork in order to protect their honey!
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Those giant hornets are nightmare beasts. Satisfying to see the bees triumph so spectacularly!
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"It was beautiful watching this video. To whomever filmed this, I would like to say thank you."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Is no one gonna talk about how the beekeeper isn't wearing a suit? What a legend
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet: "" What is my purpose""?
Queen: "" Your air conditioning""."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Well, that was terrifying.  I am so thankful that the physical limitations of having an exoskeleton on this planet keep insects from becoming the size of wolves or even chickens."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Great appreciation of bbc to record such minute details and camera angles capturing every detail of their acts üôå
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Wow this is amazing about how bees can defend themselves!!
15,UNroEwFxh6I,A moment of silence to the brave bee who gave its life for the colonyüòîüôè
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"After the the bees jump the hornet, I could just see him yelling ‚Äúaight aight I was just playing!!!‚Äù"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,For bees without school to know how temperature and how heat works that‚Äôs litteraly the smartest insect in history.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Damn nature you scary
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That doesn't work against asian hornet's. They're tinier.

15,UNroEwFxh6I,Rest in peace brave bee.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I love how the bees wasted no time and absolutely mauled the Hornet. They even let it die slowly with the worst death possible just because of one casualty.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,moving over a ton of earth considering the size of those insects is incredible ü§î
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"That one bee that sacrificed himself:
FOR THE MOTHERLAND"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"*Bees when they heard the Japanese Imperial Army Song*
Bees; BANZAAAAI!"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Nature is so extraordinary, how did they find out they can cook their enemy like that? Trial and error?"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Insanly brave work, mr. cameraman on this masterpiece

i wouldn't dream about going in a bee hive let alone a wasp nest."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Respect to the tiny camera guy getting close to the action.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,*The hornet was never warned about being attacked by the bees because none has survived to tell the other hornets about it*
15,UNroEwFxh6I,shout out to the camera man who was brave enough to go in the bee hive with no bee armor
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Respect to the bee who sacrificed itself for the advantage of it's comrades
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"A moment of silence to the bees that died killing the hornet, especially the bee that sacrificed itself."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"I salute you Mr. Yamaguchi and your swarm of wild bees. That you have been smothering hornets with heat since you were a boy speaks volumes of your combined intelligence. How can one get a spoonful of your honey, I trust you shared some with the BBC camera crew, didn't you now?"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Let‚Äôs respect the cameraman for shoving himself inside a hive to show us insect murder.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"That bee, deserves the medal of honor."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"3:45
The hornet: *Kills a bee*

The other bees: You fool, do you have any idea what you‚Äôve done?"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,The battle of the insects
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"everyone is commenting how they respect ""the bee"" that sacrificed itself, yes one was caught and killed but when the hornet died it had 2 bees in its grasp so there was 2 heroes that protected the hive RIP and F for both bees that gave up their lives for the hive!"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,When the bees attack there's one bee that instantly grabs the hornet's wing and doesn't let go... impressive
15,UNroEwFxh6I,It's insane to me that an insect can somehow understand this stuff
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Seems like a pokemon battle.

The Hornet used guillotine (its a one-hit KO).
The Bees used Overheat. 

""It's super effective."""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I salute these brave little bees üí™
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That has to be one of the coolest things I‚Äôve seen all day dame insects have combat strategies who would have known
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"The Hornet: how does it feel to die?



The bee who sacrificed itself: *you'll find out*"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"""Being unable to cope with high temperatures is a giant hornets Achilles heel"" 
Blowtorch agrees"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Rest in peace to the bees who died fighting the hornet
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet: How does it feel to die?!
Bee: No dying, sacrifice!!"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Respect those bees for sacrifices him self to kill the hornetüòû
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Bees: We're not stuck here with you, you're stuck here with us"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Holy cow, the giant Hornet is destroyed. The Japanese bees are very intelligent."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Props to the cameraman for recording in a very giant bee nest
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Bees are so inteligent. Incredible abilities.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Bro üòé this is intelligence to the finest! Wish European bees were like this!
15,UNroEwFxh6I,This keeps happening because no hornet has survived to tell the others.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That bee died for the good of the hive a true warrior at its finest
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"""Fight back!"""
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Rip the one bee who sacrificed himself we will always remember you
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Teamwork makes the dream work. Good job bees.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,I REALLY like how they waited for the wasp to throw the first punch. That‚Äôs commendable
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Damn the Bees really said: ‚Äúyou mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!‚Äù"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Insects are super intelligent..... the way they make their hives in shape of hexagon is because that shape has max volume with least area.... meaning more effective utilization of space
15,UNroEwFxh6I,Amazing footage that these bees are intelligent.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"The hornet be like

‚ÄúLemme just grab that and OH SH-‚Äú"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That one bee: ‚ÄúStrike me down and I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.‚Äù
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That's fantastic the way they all just went mad at the hornet ...I love  bees . We need them  and to help them....‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èit's a truly wonderful life of the animals. And man is still destroy ü§¢üåéüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
15,UNroEwFxh6I,That bee took one for the team. He a real one üíØ
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"To defend their hive from wasps, bees don't sting the wasp.
Instead they all crowd around the wasp and flap their wings to raise their body temperature, 
heating up the wasp until it dies"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,It never ceases to amaze me where cameramen can fit
15,UNroEwFxh6I,People just ignoring the bee cameraman making sure he gets all of this
15,UNroEwFxh6I,The intelligence of the bee never ceases to amaze me.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"The bees must've felt real good that day. Not only did they defend themselves from one of their greatest enemies, but now they have an evenly-roasted snack to go with the honey"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Hornet: you cannot defeat me
That one bee: I know but *they* can"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"Legendary bees‚úäüèº i take my hat off to them
That was phenomenal!üêù‚ô•Ô∏èüíõüß°üëë"
15,UNroEwFxh6I,This is what happens when you rush into a dungeon without leveling up.
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"I know someone who refuses to eat honey and calls it bee vomit. It quite literally is, but I don't remind them how many dinosaur willies the water in their coffee has been through."
15,UNroEwFxh6I,"That's probably one of the greatest ambushes I've seen in my life,I hate wasps."
